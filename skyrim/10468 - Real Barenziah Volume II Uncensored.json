  "descriptionHtml": "Did this really quick for myself and decided to upload it. For me, it\\'s less about adding smutty material to the game, and more about being lore-friendly. True, the Dunmer fled Morrowind and doubtless brought several of their books with them, but every copy of the Real Barenziah Volume II is censored by the Tribunal Temple? The Temple that hasn\\'t actually existed for the last 200 years? Is every copy of the book from the Dunmer diaspora and 200 years old? I know Nords aren\\'t much for reading, but that couldn\\'t possibly be the case.\r\n\r\nSo, this replaces every copy to remove the \\\"[Censored by the Temple]\\\" line, and restores [url=\\\"http://www.imperial-library.info/content/real-barenziah-part-4\\\"]the text as originally seen in Daggerfall.[/url] I did not write this, it\\'s Bethesda\\'s own official lore that appeared in their own games. All rights are exclusively theirs.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Warning[/u][/b]\r\nIt\\'s in adult content because the passage is extremely sexually graphic. Don\\'t download if you don\\'t want such things in your game.\r\n\r\n[b][u]ChangeLog[/u][/b]\r\n\r\n02-21-2012 - Realized that the title of the book was set to Vanilla \\\"v2\\\" instead of the Better Sorting \\\"Vol. 2\\\". Changed that. The vanilla version is still available for anyone who prefers not to use Better Sorting. Nothing else in the actual text has changed.",
