  "descriptionHtml": "This is the three bladed sword from that cheesy movie the sword and the sorcerer.  Now someone else was already doing this but he or she never finished making the mod and this was while i was working on the blade.  Finally this blade is done, it took me like three days to finish this blade.  Now this sword doesn&#39;t have the ability to shoot out a blade to strike it&#39;s enemy, i don&#39;t know how to make that work.  I know that the bloodskal sword can create an energy wave when power swung, but if i were to do that, this weapon would require the dragonborn dlc and i don&#39;t want dlcs to ruin your fun.\r<br />\r<br />Models and Textures create by me\r<br />(i suck at making textures)\r<br />\r<br />IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS IN ANY PROJECTS LET ME KNOW\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE DO NOT UPLOAD THIS TO ANOTHER SITE",
