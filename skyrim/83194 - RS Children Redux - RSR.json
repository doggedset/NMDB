  "descriptionHtml": "[center][/center][center][color=#cfe2f3]-\r<br />[size=4]disclaimer\r<br />[/size]-\r<br />this is not my work. this is just an assortment of mods made by other people. i will delete this if any authors that helped to make this possible object to this mod being here (this is the only place that it&#39;s going to be uploaded with these resources, it&#39;s going to stay that way).\r<br />-\r<br />[size=4]info\r<br />[/size]-\r<br />this is a replacer of a child replacer, it requires rs children right now. i was working on a completely separate replacement for kids, but it was hard to do (i&#39;m not the most experienced in the ck) so i decided to use the open resource [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55555]RS Children[/url] by ranaline as a base&#33; first of all, this adds 22 new [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68311/?]hairs[/url] to the game (mainly female hairs, sorry). this changes the eyes, replacing them with higher quality ones from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79622/?]Witcher 3 Eyes [/url]by Oaristys. changes brows to an amazing high resolution set of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30411/?]Brows by Hvelgmir[/url] that will probably kill your frame rate. this also updates the head texture. the head texture is not required, and you&#39;ll probably delete it. basically it adds more shine to the lips and makes the eyelash shadows a little longer. as of now, you probably shouldn&#39;t use the head texture if you don&#39;t like neck seams and can live with slightly less glossy lips and slightly less longer eyelash shadows. finally, it changes Braith&#39;s hair to a cute, long hairstyle so she&#39;s not as similar to Adara. regarding the comments section, please keep everything pg i guess and \r<br />-\r<br />[size=4]requirements\r<br />[/size]-\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55555]RS Children Overhaul - playable all dlc version[/url] + all Bethesda dlcs\r<br />-\r<br />[size=4]installation[/size]\r<br />-\r<br />the way i uploaded this mod correlates to the way i wish things were uploaded. if you&#39;re like me, you have horrible internet. so, i uploaded things separately. the main module, read me, and presets are separated. i don&#39;t usually read the read mes anyway, so that extra few kb&#39;s is a waste. the readme states how to manually install, and pick and choose what parts of this mod you&#39;d like. the mod description included in that is a few hours old, i changed the description since then, and i don&#39;t feel like updating it oops\r<br />-\r<br />[size=4]future plans\r<br />[/size]-\r<br />i&#39;d like to add different weights to the bodies, with a skinny _0 and a chubby _1 .nif because sometimes i want to roleplay as a beggar, or an overweight noble child. (that sounds kinda odd??) also, new nevernude skin textures in 2k and 4k&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />-\r<br />[size=4]credits[/size]\r<br />[size=3][i]please notify me if i missed anything. thank you&#33;\r<br />[/i][/size]-\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55555]RS Children Overhaul[/url] by Ranaline\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30411/?][/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30411/?][/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30411/?]Brows[/url] by Hverglmir\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68311/?]KS Hairdos Renewal[/url] by Kalilies\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79735/?]Sand and Wind KS Hairdos Retexture[/url] by Jasper\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79622/?]Witcher 3 Eyes[/url] by Oaristys\r<br />triptherift, Ranaline, tktk1, and Bagserk for inspiration.\r<br />-\r<br />[size=4]screenshots[/size]\r<br />[size=2]-[/size]\r<br />please upload your SFW screenshots. no matter the quality, your SFW image would help add to the gallery. somehow even i was able to take those screenshots with an Intel HD Graphics 2000 gpu...\r<br />...\r<br />mods in screenshots:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83091/?]Antique Dragon ENB[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9557/?]Alternate Start - Live Another Life[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51473/?]iNeed[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?]RaceMenu[/url]\r<br />and finally, the character is used the exact same mods in the credits.\r<br />-[/color][/center][center][color=#cfe2f3][size=4]tools used\r<br />[/size][/color][/center][center][color=#cfe2f3]-\r<br />paint.net - head texture, comparing brows and eyes for the most similar replacements.\r<br />nifskope - source of my depression. oh, also rerooting texture paths for the new hair.\r<br />creation kit - adding hairs, changing preset faces for each race and gender.\r<br />tes5edit - cleaning out the mod, making sure i didn&#39;t mess anything up, deleting errors.\r<br />-[/color][/center]",
