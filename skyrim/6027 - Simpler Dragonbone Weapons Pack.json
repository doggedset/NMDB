  "descriptionHtml": "Simpler Dragonbone Weapons Pack\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nIn short this mod adds several craftable weapons made of dragon bone to skyrim blacksmithing stations and buffs up the dragon plate armor so that it is slightly stronger than the Daedric counterparts. \r\n\r\nThis mod was originally made by AeonVita and his crew SO ALL CREDITS GO TO THEM.\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1935\r\n\r\nThe only changes I made was to just remove certain weapons that I think cannot be made from dragon bones....IN MY OPINION bones cannot be made into Arrows (unless only the tips of arrows), Katana and Dai-katana, and Scimitar, and any of the Nordic Dragonbone weapons....they would be too brittle.....these weapons all look like they need durable/pliable metal to be that thin and sharp where as bones are strong and rigid so would have a ruff edged look to them thus only the orisch type weapons are kept with the default color of bones (see pics).\r\n\r\nAlso, removed the Dragon Heart requirement for crafting in place of leather strips. (you still need to have dragon smithing perk so smithig at 100 to have access to these weapons).\r\n\r\nI have kept the dragonplate armor buff for I felt the same as AeonVita did (see his mod for details). \r\n\r\nThis mod is for those like me who only want simpler parts of AeonVita\\'s mod but can\\'t mod; this edit was only done for my personal use but friends asked for it so I posted it; again all actual work was done by AeonVita so all thanks goes to him.
