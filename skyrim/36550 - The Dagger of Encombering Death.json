  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is mostly just for fun. all you have to do to obtain it is go to a forge in the iron smithing file and smith. Although since it is a fun mod, it has a crazy recipe. A friend of mine wanted me to make this, so yes it seems like a shady mod, but it won\\'t kill you. It should be a one hit kill. But yes it does weigh a ton, hence the encumbering death. I will later make other serious weapon mods, but again this is just for fun.",
