  "descriptionHtml": "I was annoyed that the werebear still used the werewolf sounds so I changed which sounds to play to feel more like a bear and not a wolf.\r\n\r\nThis small file causes the game to play bear sounds instead of werewolf sounds. Be advised as this will give all werewolves in the game bear sounds.\r\n\r\nTo install: Simply extract the esp file into the data folder and make sure it\\'s checked or download with NMM.\r\n\r\nTo actually be a werebear, you need another mod to enable that. This mod just changes the sounds.\r\n\r\nClip demonstrating sounds\r\n[youtube]0geyAflwN7k[/youtube]\r\n\r\nIgnore the night eye effect, it\\'s not part of this mod.",
