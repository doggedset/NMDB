  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE: Finally added many screenshots, along with a basic \\\"cover image\\\" for this mod created in less than an hour with Microsoft Word and MS Paint. Also added an \\\"Improved Stormcloak Armor\\\" file that does what it says :D Download, comment and endorse!\r\n\r\nMOD DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod, so I hope it you all like it :D \r\n\r\nI had to wonder why the Imperial Legion in Skyrim, which is clearly based on the ancient Roman army, was endowed with pretty low-quality weapons and armor. Considering how the Legion conquered all of Tamriel and fought off the Thalmor, I figured they needed quality weapons and armor to do so, and this mod aims to \\\"correct\\\" that oversight in-game. \r\n\r\nI gave Imperial heavy armor the same stats as Orcish armor, Imperial light armor the same stats as Glass armor (the Studded Imperial cuirass is a bit better than the standard Glass cuirass) and the Imperial bow and sword the same stats as their ebony counterparts. \r\n\r\nThe value of the Imperial gear and weapons remains the same, so you aren\\'t encouraged to murder legionnaires to pilfer and sell their equipment :D\r\n\r\n I also bumped up the stats for the Skyforge Steel weapons; the rationale being that if the Skyforge is so mystical, its products should be rather powerful and that the Companions - being so fearsome and all - should use quality products. And so I gave the Skyforge weapons the same stats as Daedric. \r\n\r\nIn the second mod file I created a \\\"new\\\" variety of steel arrows called \\\"Imperial Arrows\\\" which have a bit more than twice the original steel arrow damage (e.g. the same as Daedric arrows) and three times the value (now worth 6 septims instead of just 2). They can be purchased from Beirand in Castle Dour. \r\n\r\nPeople who would be thrilled with this mod: people who like the realistic look of the Skyforge steel weapons/arrows but not their stats, players who support the Empire, etc. \r\n\r\nPlease comment and endorse! :) ",
