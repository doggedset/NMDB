  "descriptionHtml": "this is my setting, i tryed to make the game as real looking as possible. i went through great lengths to do so. lol.\r\n\r\ni went outside with a sony cybershot hd camera to take pictures to try and emulate them ingame\r\n\r\nits still a little more saturated than i like, but i had to compromise because it needs to be even inside and outside. \r\n\r\nif you like it, dl and endorse. if you don\\'t you can mess with the inerds of the fxaa text doc.\r\n\r\ndrag and drop to your root, made with 1.3 fxaa ppi (setting 2). might update sometime. but if it ain\\'t broke, why fix it? lol.\r\n\r\ndownload fxaa ppi 1.3 below\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=131\r\n\r\nnot sure if it works with 2.1 it might. try it i guess, and if it does or doesn\\'t, feel free to message me, or leave a comment about it. that would be a great help.",
