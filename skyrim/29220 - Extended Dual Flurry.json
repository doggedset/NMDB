  "descriptionHtml": "This is a Just4Fun Mod, i made very Quickly. It\\'s Another simple Learning step for the CK and someday, i may be able to make more than simple .esp Files :D\r\n\r\nThis Mod adds a third  Rank to the \\\"Dual Flurry\\\" Skill in the One-Handed Perk Tree.\r\nIt\\'s Learnable at One-Handed Level 75 and Improves the Dual Wield Attack by 50%\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nNOTE ON THE 4TH PERK RANK\r\nThe 4th and last Perk rank was removed due to an unfixable (?) Bug. when you attack with Dual-Wielded Daggers, a bug occurs that makes you unable to strike again without sheathing and unsheathing your weapons again. This is caused by the game/engine itself because it is usually impossible to strike at such a speed.\r\nThe 3rd rank however is still available, and does exactly what i aimed at when making this Mod;\r\nIf you Attack with Daggers, you will barely be able to see the Weapons swing.\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nInstallation: Unzip in the Skyrim/Data Folder and Check it as loaded Mod.\r\nTo Uninstall, just delete the .esp File.\r\n\r\nBy Request of Ayhay123 I added the \\\"Download with NMM\\\" Button\r\nYou can now use this Option...\r\n\r\nRedistribute as you wish, but please give me Credits for this.\r\n\r\nNuf said, have fun.\r\n\r\nWarrior of xD",
