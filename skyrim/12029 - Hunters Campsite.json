  "summary": "A fairly simple mod that adds a campsite in the wilderness, slightly North of Helgen.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center]This is a rather simple mod that I had originally made for personal use, but later decided that I might as well release it :). This was my first time trying out the Creation Kit, so I thought I\\'d make something useful to my character.[/center]\r\n[center][size=+2][u][color=darkturquoise]Hunter\\'s Campsite[/color][/u][/size][/center]\r\n\r\n[center]It adds a campsite in the wilderness made with hunters in mind. It\\'s easily accessible, as it has a custom fast-travel marker. It also has a few other things which would be useful to a hunter such as: storage, a tanning rack, a cooking spit and a bedroll. I\\'ve made sure to try and small details such as hay and logs lying around so it looks a little nicer.\r\n\r\n[color=red]The chest should be safe to store your items in but I\\'m not really too sure about the barrels and sack.The chest was copied from a vanilla player house, to be on the safe side but there\\'s a chance the other stuff may reset.[/color]\r\n\r\nv1.1\r\n--------------\r\n- Added lighting to the candle by the chest\r\n- Added a path texture to the floor leading to the ramp\r\n\r\nEndorsements would be greatly appreciated if you enjoyed using the mod ;)[/center]\r\n\r\n[center]Installation: Just drag and drop it into your Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/Data folder, just like any other mod with just one .esp and enjoy.[/center]\r\n\r\n-liamcas\r\n\r\n",
