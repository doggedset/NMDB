I designed this texture for my personal use because I wanted a lower weight texture with good detail sort of a have your cake and eat it too . This is a Unp and Unp variant texture I won&#39;t be making a cbbe because I don&#39;t use it and stuff I am beta testing is based on the 7bunp body . There is no fur.....I use race menu so I can grow it and shave as I please . \r<br />\r<br />           This a simple texture re placer  comes in two flavors GP and Non GP  if you read credits you know what GP is . Should be compatible with most normals unless there is a despairing deference between resolutions in head and body normals  , if there is a slight difference I recommend [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50329]vwr Neck Seam Fix[/url] . Splitting seams from armors that are not your native body type can&#39;t help you with . Each package is Mod Organizer and Nexus Mod Manager ready .\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff00ff][size=5] Disclaimer :[size=3] [color=#f4f4f4]Tats , Tan lines , and Pubic hair not included .
