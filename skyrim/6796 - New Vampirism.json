New powers, new magics, new effects. Still work in progress, will be updated time by time, but each part can work alone or together and the finished parts are available for download. Updated files will contain \\\"readme\\\" for changes.\r\n\r\nThanks to \\\"northwood\\\" for his awesome RealVamp mod and for the helpful tips.

At lvl 1 you only have 100 HP but you get -50 as Sun Damage so be careful.\r\nVarious races has been updated such as Sabrecats, bears, wolves, trolls, giants, draugers, dremoras with 10-20% height and 25-50-100% Health bonus. \r\nVampirism has been reversed, you have to feed to became stronger. You gain power, speed and stronger magics when you just fed and losing your power, strength, speed, etc when not feeding.  Powers are similar to v2.0 except \\\"Vampiric Reflex\\\" that has been removed from the mod. The new vampiric abilities as follow : Vampiric Lungs -can swim underwater, Vampiric Power -increased unarmed dmg, Vampiric Speed -increased movement speed, Vampiric Strike -increased melee dmg, Blessing of the Night -increased healing while not in Sunlight, Blood Vision -nighteye with blood detection, Vampiric Resistance -increased dmg resistance.  Constant Sun damage now only active at Stage 4 in direct Sunlight >> you can hide in the shadows and other stages have been altered, now only receiving health damage of sun when in direct sunlight, if the weather is rainy or cloudy or under some shadow, no damage received.  Powers are active at night or in interiors but hidden and not listed at the Magic Effects section in menu. Only Vampiric Lungs is listed. A shadow cloak effect appears when the powers are activating.\r\n\r\n[center][size=4][b]xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx [STAGES] xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx[/b][/size][/center]\r\n\r\n*Stage 1 vampires: \r\n-Health reduced by 50 and does not recover.\r\n                          -Power +50\r\n                          -Speed +100\r\n                          -Strike +20\r\n                          -Resistance +25\r\n                          -Drain 50 pts/s\r\n                          -Frost Resistance +100\r\n\r\n*Stage 2 vampires: \r\n-Health reduced by 75 and does not recover.\r\n                          -Power +40\r\n                          -Speed +75\r\n                          -Strike +15\r\n                          -Resistance +20\r\n                          -Drain  40 pts/s\r\n                          -Frost Resistance +75\r\n\r\n*Stage 3 vampires: \r\n-Health reduced by 100 and does not recover.\r\n                          -Power +30\r\n                          -Speed +50\r\n                          -Strike +10\r\n                          -Resistance +15\r\n                          -Drain  25 pts/s\r\n                          -Frost Resistance +50\r\n\r\n*Stage 4 vampires: \r\n-Health reduced by 200 and does not recover + Sun Damage 10/sec\r\n                          -Power +20\r\n                          -Speed +25\r\n                          -Strike +5\r\n                          -Resistance +10\r\n                          -Drain  15 pts/s\r\n                          -Frost Resistance +25\r\n\r\n[center][size=4][b]xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx [CHANGE LOG] xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx [/b][/size][/center]\r\n\r\n*Vampire Races gain 0.0100 in height and can regenerate Magicka and Stamina 50% faster >> compared to vanilla races.\r\n\r\n*Feeding is available from sleeping or dead NPCs.\r\n\r\n*Blood Vision - NightEye effect + Blood detection.\r\n\r\n*Vampire Charm works on higher lvl NPCs for 60sec.\r\n\r\n*Raise Thrall can reanimate higher lvl NPCs for 60sec.\r\n\r\n*Sun Damage added to NPC vampires.\r\n\r\n*Feeding/Starving and Progression messages have been changed.0\r\n\r\n*Female vampires now using the correct eyes texture.\r\n\r\n*Night hours changed to 7pm - 6am.\r\n\r\n*Optional \\\"RedEye\\\" for vampires included.\r\n\r\n*Only choose one of the .esp files, see above the differences.\r\n\r\n*NMM versions included at download section.\r\n\r\n*v3.2 update - contains playable vampire races (all races, no presets and defaults looks ugly) , various beasts and monsters gained height and health bonuses for more interesting gameplay.
