  "descriptionHtml": "EDIT - MOD IS NOT NECESSARY ANYMORE, OFFICIAL HIGH-RES TEXTURE PACK FIXES THE TEXTURES ITSELF :)\r\n\r\nAfter installing the HD 2K texture pack, I noticed that the awful rugs and banners in Jorrvaskr (which I already hated when in saw them in one of Skyrim\\'s first screenshots!), were still ugly looking. I went searching for a mod and did not find any... so, I made it myself.\r\n\r\n- Increased texture size to make it possible to add more detail\r\n- Changed colors of the carpet a bit: Yellow is less greenish, dated yellow and more golden yellow. Red is less purple, blue red, and more warm red.\r\n- Added carpet-like stitching details to make it look more like a rug.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy, please endorse when you\\'re satisfied with this mod.\r\n\r\nBob",
