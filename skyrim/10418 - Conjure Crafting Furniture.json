  "descriptionHtml": "Update: \r\n* Farengar now sells this spell tome.\r\n* The magicka cost has been doubled. \r\n* The \\\"smithing\\\" option will summon all the blacksmith furniture at once.\r\n* The furniture will not disappear.\r\n\r\nYou can only have one furniture piece conjured at a time with exception of the \\\"smithing\\\" set. By attacking the furniture piece, you dismiss it which allows you to conjure another furniture piece. For the \\\"smithing\\\" set, attacking the anvil is the only way to dispel the set. Make sure you dispel the furniture! I can not guarantee you will be able to cast the spell again if you do not dispel the furniture and it gets unloaded. \r\n\r\nIf a furniture spawns under you, jumping away from it should do the trick. For best results, conjure the \\\"smithing\\\" set on wide flat area.",
