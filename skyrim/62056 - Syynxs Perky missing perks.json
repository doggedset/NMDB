  "descriptionHtml": "So basically I was playing with Syynxs Perky http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12862/? and I noticed that some of the perks were missing or inaccessible. So I created a small batch file that adds the perks to your character. Primarily for those that are unfamiliar with using the command console.\r<br />\r<br />So far I have only added a few perks that I have noticed. If I notice more, or someone comments one that I have missed I will add them to the bat file.\r<br />\r<br />Smithing:\r<br />Glass Smithing\r<br />Dwarven Smithing\r<br />Orcish Smithing\r<br />Ebony Smithing\r<br />Daedric Smithing\r<br />Dragon Smithing\r<br />\r<br />1-H:\r<br />Fists of Steel\r<br />\r<br />Use:\r<br />1. Download the .rar file\r<br />2. Extract the .txt and place the .txt file in your Skyrim directory \r<br />3. Launch game and load your save file\r<br />4. Press the tilde button &#34;~&#34; ( on US keyboards it is located to the left of the &#34;1&#34; key)\r<br />    this will open the command console and pause the game\r<br />5. Type in &#34;bat perks&#34; without the quotations\r<br />6. (Optional) go to a forge and verify that you have all the craft-able items in the proper categories.\r<br />\r<br />If there are any questions feel free to comment and I or another user will assist as best as possible.\r<br />And if you like it feel free to endorse. :)",
