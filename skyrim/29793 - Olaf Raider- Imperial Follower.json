When he arrived in whiterun he had been to most of skyrim. When he was 15 he left home for Riften to join the Thieves guild, They denied him so he stayed in riften till he was about 20 when a young adventure named Jones befriended him and took him to a Dwarven site. They traveled deeper into the cave, eventual running into centurion which almost killed Olaf, Jones ran for cover they eventually killed it and found some dwarven armor. Olaf took the armor and Jones took every thing else, when they got out of the cave they both traveled to markarth which took around 7 months because they stopped and did quests and other things. \r\n-----Other mods--------\r\nJones made by me------------------------ http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25599\r\nUFO (Ultimate follower overhaul) made by fLokii------  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037 \r\n",
