What an amazing concept! Who\\'d a thunk it?\r\n\r\nThey are only one colour, but the Cuirass in game comes in several varieties so I made them a \\\"neutral\\\" as possible to hopefully look OK with all variants.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn\\'t interfere with any other Dawnguard mods, as I didn\\'t create recipes or anything, I simply changed the meshes that the \\\"Heavy\\\" boots and gauntlets point too.\r\n\r\nLet me know if there is an issue with any other mods conflicting.\r\n\r\nOnce again, the textures aren\\'t High Def, and no, I won\\'t make a HD version, because it\\'s pointless putting a 2k x 2k texture on an item you\\'ll only see from a far enough away that it make no difference whatsoever.\r\n\r\n(Sorry the items in the SS are enchanted, hence the \\\"glow\\\" effects, I\\'ll get some more SS up soon, unless someone does it before me)\r\n\r\nCredits/thanks to:\r\nBugthesda\r\nThe Niftools Team\r\nPaint.net\r\nThe Nexus for letting us run wild with our imaginations!\r\n",
