  "summary": "Changes Ebony Mail to Light Armor, and adds an unenchanted, craftable version.",
  "descriptionHtml": "DESCRIPTION\r\nSo first mod here, I loved the look of the Ebony Mail, but found it was pretty useless because of the smoke effect, \r\na sneaking enchantment that\\'s useless because of the heavy armor category, and its inability to be tempered.\r\nSo here you go, Ebony Mail is now in the light armor category, and I added a craftable version that has no enhancements,\r\nand can properly be upgraded. Now, how is this different from the other Ebony Mail mods you may ask? \r\nWell, some of the other mods either don\\'t properly remove the Ebony Mail effects, or are missing proper keywords,\r\nso I made my own that fixed those errors and I added my own craftable version. \r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n> Changes Ebony Mail to the Light Armor category as it was in Morrowind.\r\n> Adds an unenchanted version that can be crafted, tempered, and enchanted.\r\n> Very little edits, so should have maximum compatibility.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\nJust drag the EnhancedEbonyCrafting.esp into your Skyrim/Data folder and activate through the \r\nfile manager you use, load order should not matter as I did not touch anything besides armor.\r\n\r\nTHANKS\r\n> Bethesda for such a modifiable game engine.\r\n> Red Bull for helping through learning the Creation Kit.\r\n> And of course, the nexus for hosting this mod.",
