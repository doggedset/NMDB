And since I thought the final result isn&#39;t too bad, I&#39;m sharing it here in case someone else may want it, too. So here we are&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/5etADLu.png?1[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />Now, in all seriousness, the file has been cleaned with TES5EDIT, does not require any DLC, is fully navmeshed and has no scripts, so it should be safe for everybody to use. Still, you should always make a backup save before installing ANY mod, in case something goes wrong.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve always loved the hilarious, yet very well-done [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6903/?]Argonian Skin Shoes[/url] by Novamonk/Mathanas, and the other day I got the idea of giving them a little backstory. I know the original mod has an esp where you can get the shoes, but I wanted to try my hand at making a tiny cave/dungeon kind of thing. I think it came out rather nice&#33; The cave is located near Morthal; there is a visible map marker, but you&#39;ll need to visit it first before you can fast-travel. \r<br />\r<br />Unfortunately, I have not received (yet) a reply to the PM I sent for permission to use the shoe textures in the mod, so my mod requires [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6903/?]Argonian Skin Shoes[/url] for the time being. Simply download the [u]optional file[/u] &#34;Argonian Skin Shoes Textures&#34; (that is textures only), and extract both &#34;f&#34; and &#34;m&#34; folders you&#39;ll find in &#34;textures/clothes/barkeeper&#34; to my &#34;textures/ArgonianShoesDungeon&#34;. Overwrite when asked, and you&#39;re done. If you did it wrong (or if you skip this step altogether) the shoes will appear bright purple in-game&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I may consider adding a special effect to the shoes so Argonians could become hostile while they are equipped, but that would involve scripting and unfortunately I am not good with that. If anybody would like to help me out, it would be appreciated&#33;\r<br />\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use the Mod Manager to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Now, for the credits:\r<br />\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6903/?]Argonian Skin Shoes[/url] by Novamonk/Mathanas, for giving me the inspiration to make this&#33;\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28957/?]Beast Skeletons[/url] by Prometheus and mod Issgard.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12370/?]Ornate Steel Weapons Texture - Resource[/url] by PhilSchmidheiny.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14133/?]FoodContainer Resource[/url] by Blary.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16525/?]Modders Resource Pack[/url] by Oaristys and Tony67.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26132/?] Resources for modders[/url] by Runspect.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36756/?]Berts Bits And Bobs Resources For Modders[/url] by berticus0001.\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1869302/Skyrim/Banners/Knotwork.png[/img][/center]",
