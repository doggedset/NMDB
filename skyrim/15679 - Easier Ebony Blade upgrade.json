  "summary": "Ebony blade upgrades with every friendly NPC killed instead of two.",
  "descriptionHtml": "If you&#39;re like me and hate killing unique named NPCs, then you must have trouble finding 10 victims to fully upgrade the Ebony blade. This trivial script tweak makes Mephala speak to you and upgrade the sword after every kill instead of every two, so you only have to find 5 victims. Besides, it just seems more logical to me that a daedra princess rewards you every time you appease her.\r<br />\r<br />DISCLAIMER:\r<br />If you don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t need it, happily kill everyone you meet in the world of Skyrim without any remorse, or think using this mod is cheating, I don&#39;t care. Just don&#39;t use it. Duh.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />No .esp, just a slightly tweaked script. I suggest you use the Mod Manager to install it so that a backup is automatically created. Of couse you can just extract the archive into the game folder.\r<br />\r<br />The mod will not work retroactively and it&#39;s just outside my scripting expertise to make it do so, so don&#39;t bother asking.",
