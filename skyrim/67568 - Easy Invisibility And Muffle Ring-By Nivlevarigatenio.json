  "descriptionHtml": "Easy Ring Of Invisiblity-Simple ring adding bat file\r<br />By Nivlevarigatenio\r<br />Descripition:\r<br />this mod is fairly straightforward to explain and is also very simple to use.\r<br />essentially: its a bat file that you can run through the console in game and it would instantly add a special enchanted ring,simply titled &#34;gold ring&#34; to your inventory.\r<br />for those fearing a virus issue: i&#39;ll explain the process that this bat does: like all bat files: it feeds a command into the game: what this command does is tell the game to fast-render\r<br />a gold ring with certain enchantments and add it to the player&#39;s inventory. that&#39;s it.\r<br />to get this mod to work,you don&#39;t need anything but a simple copy of THE ELDER SCROLLS V-SKYRIM: No DLC Or Other Modding Required.\r<br />to install the mod: simply extract the text(.txt)  file to your skyrim root folder(where the launcher and game executible is)\r<br />to get the ring in game:simply open the console throught the tild key(~) and type in:\r<br />bat PCD \r<br />(PCD is short for &#34;portable cloaking device&#34;)\r<br />the ring is enchanted with  simple invisiblity AND muffle effects: those making you both entirely invisible when crouching,but also muffled to fully avoid detection.\r<br />this is A CHEAT MOD&#33; if you don&#39;t approve of cheating: simply don&#39;t download this mod.\r<br />known issues:\r<br />-sometimes it can lead to deteaction: the ring is fast-rendered by the game to ensure the console parameters the bat file feeds are met: it will work most of the time,but close proximity\r<br />to an npc or beast could lead to detection: this ring also heavly relies on your stealth skills so DON&#39;T BLAME ME.\r<br />special thanks:\r<br />bethesda: for skyrim\r<br />skyrim modding-for skyrim awesomness\r<br />community love-for being good chaps\r<br />good luck&#33;\r<br />",
