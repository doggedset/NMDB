  "descriptionHtml": "[center]﻿[/center][center][size=6][color=#1e84cc][b]\n<br />\n<br />LUCYAH THE BEAUTY IS HERE FOR YOU\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/color][/size][size=6]\n<br />[/size][/center][size=3]So after posting some screenshots of my favorite character, I received some requests to share her racemenu preset for anyone who will like her, so i am here very proud to introduce to you LUCYAH.\n<br />\n<br />She can be whoever you want her to be, you wanna see her bending while cleaning the house? Alright!! Put on her some sexy maid outfit and she will do the rest!\n<br />\n<br />You wanna see her kicking some ass like a bad girl? No problem! Give her a good set of armor and weapon and she will be glad to fight and crush some skull with you!\n<br />\n<br />Whatever you want to do with her, you can not help but admire her pure and innocent beauty that will stole your heart forever.....well....maybe for a little bit\n<br />\n<br />Oh and i almost forgot, she is a NORD, so you will find her preset only if you use a NORD RACE character (i'm sorry, that's how it works)\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00][size=3][b]So what to do to get her like the pictures?\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/size][/color][size=3]The first thing to say is that Lucyah came in two variants very similar to each others, one with a more seductive face and one with a more innocent expression but the difference is little (see the screenshots description)\n<br />The two preset contains everything (body + head) this means that when you load my preset it will change also your body shape, not just the head (really!? Yes....) so if you don't like her body (and i doubt it you piggy guys ;)) or you use another body than CBBE you have to save the head preset and then load it on your own favorite body (for the beginners).[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=3][b]IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THE BODY[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Instead for those who like her body CBBE is required, and to have it just like the pictures you have to:\n<br />\n<br />1. Open bodyslide and select your main body or Outfit\n<br />\n<br />2. Select the [b]CBBE Curvy[/b] preset from the preset tab   ﻿[b]   [color=#e06666]﻿IMPORTANT[/color]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />3. Check the \"racemenu morphs\" box and build the body\n<br />\n<br />4. Enjoy her in- game (obviously....)\n<br />\n<br />That's it, now the body should be exactly like the pictures.\n<br />\n<br />If you have any problem getting the body right, please let me know so maybe i can help you further.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][size=4]REQUIREMENTS TIIIIIIIIIME!!!!!![/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[b]SKSE:[/b]   ﻿[size=3]http://skse.silverlock.org/[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]RACEMENU:[/b]   ﻿[size=3]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]RACEMENU PRECACHE KILLER:[/b]   ﻿[size=3]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33526/[/size]   [size=2]Always good to have it[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]CBBE:[/b]   ﻿[size=3]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666/[/size]   [size=2]Remember to select the[color=#00ff00] [b]CBBE Curvy preset[/b][/color] in the preset tab in Bodyslide and then build the body, otherwise it will not look like the pictures.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]BODYSLIDE:[/b]   ﻿[size=3]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49015/[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cccccc][size=3][b]XPMSE:[/b]   ﻿   ﻿https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68000/\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/color][b]LITH FACE ENHANCEMENT:[/b]   ﻿[size=3]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26354/[/size]   [size=2]﻿The face is based on this mod so if you dont install this, she will look different and[/size][size=3] [/size][size=2]maybe weird[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]CITRUS HD HEAD MESHES:[/b]   ﻿[size=3]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58989/[/size]   [size=2]High polygon head meshes, for smoother faces\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b]KS HAIRDOS:[/b][size=3]   ﻿http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68311/?   ﻿[/size]   [size=2]﻿Does that one need a description?\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][size=4][b]RECOMMENDED IF YOU WANT HER TO LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THE PICTURES[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[b]BROWS:[/b]   ﻿https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30411/\n<br />\n<br />[b]SG FEMALE EYEBROWS:[/b]   ﻿[size=3]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35327/[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]SEDUCTIVE LIPS HD:[/b]   ﻿[size=3]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22701/[/size]   ﻿   [size=2]HIGH RES FEMALE LIPS, RECOMMENDED[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]YEVMODS HIGH RES MAKE UP:[/b]   ﻿[size=3]https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/3148-yevmods-makeup-pack-ymmp-2k-4k/[/size]   [size=2]﻿Add a good variety and quantity of make up, very[/size][size=3] [/size][size=2]beautyful and high res[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]STOJA'S WARPAINT :[/b]   ﻿[size=3]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60769/[/size]   [size=2]﻿Same here, a lot of beautyful make up for customization[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]TITKIT:[/b]   ﻿[size=3]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57157[/size]   ﻿   [size=2]﻿Just if you wanna change the nipple color, recommended[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]THE EYES OF BEAUTY:[/b]   ﻿[size=3]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722/[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]REAL HD RGR ENB:[/b]   ﻿[size=3]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75056/[/size]   [size=2]﻿ENB used in my screenshots, the best in my opinion[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][size=4][b]INSTALLATION YEEEEAH\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/size][/color][size=3]1.
