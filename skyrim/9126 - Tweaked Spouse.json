  "summary": "This mod makes the faces of almost all characters the player can marry much more pleasant to look at by making minor changes to the shape of their faces. While they still remain themselves.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This file can also be found on the Steam Workshop.\r\n\r\nThis mod changes some of the proportions of the faces of the NPC available for marriage to the player. This makes their faces a lot more pleasant to look at. Many of the characters look more friendly than they did before, something Bethesda had missed. I mean, no one wants to marry a cranky person, right? This was achieved mainly by elevating the eyebrows slightly.\r\nSome of the characters also have the shapes of their eyes and/or noses altered to fit better with the new proportions or to take away the feeling of them trying to spot a lie in your words all the time. Like I had with Jordis, her eyes were always peeled, as if she didn’t trust me…\r\n\r\nMany of the male characters available for marriage were all very dirty. And while I’m not a woman, I can very much imagine them being reluctant of marrying a very dirty, smelly pig. So what I did was, I cleaned them up a bit. Some characters still have some dirt on their face (like blacksmiths and miners), but they also seem a bit less dirty. For instance, I sometimes changed the colour of the dirt to make it seem less dirty.\r\n\r\nI kept in mind that all these characters are different, so I made sure that I still kept the general outlines of the faces so that you still have the same “feel” with the characters, though I did take away the war paint with Mjoll the Lioness (while still keeping her scars) and with Aela the Huntress, mainly because these covered their faces to such an extent that they masked their own beauty entirely.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, remarks, ideas or suggestions, I will be checking this page regularly.\r\n\r\nV1.1:\r\nTweaked NPCs:\r\n\r\nWomen:\r\nIona\r\nJordis the Sword-Maiden\r\nLydia\r\nYsolda\r\n\r\nMen:\r\nFarkas\r\nOctieve San\r\n\r\n\r\nV1.0:\r\nTweaked NPCs:\r\n\r\nWomen:\r\nAela the Huntress\r\nAeri\r\nAnwen\r\nAvrusa Sarethi\r\nBorghak the Steel Heart\r\nBrelyna Maryon\r\nCamilla Valerius\r\nDravynea the Stoneweaver\r\nGhorza gra-Bagol\r\nGilfre\r\nGrelka\r\nIona\r\nJenassa\r\nJordis the Sword-Maiden\r\nMjoll the Lioness\r\nMuiri\r\nNjada Stone-Arm\r\nOrla\r\nRia\r\nSenna\r\nSylgja\r\nTaarie\r\nTemba Wide-Arm\r\nUthgerd the Unbroken\r\nViola Giordano\r\nYsolda\r\n\r\nMen:\r\nAinethach\r\nAngrenor Once-Honored\r\nArgis the Bulwark\r\nAthis\r\nBalimund\r\nBelrand\r\nBenor\r\nCalder\r\nCosnach\r\nErik the Slayer\r\nFarkas\r\nFilnjar\r\nGat gro-Shargakh\r\nGhorbash the Iron Hand\r\nMarcusio\r\nMoth gro-Bagol\r\nOctieve San\r\nOmluag\r\nOdfel\r\nOnmund\r\nPavo Attius\r\nPerth\r\nQuintus Navale\r\nTevyn Sadri\r\nRoggi Knot-Beard\r\nRomlyn Dreth\r\nSondas Drenim\r\nSorex Vinius\r\nStenvar\r\nTorvar\r\nVilkas\r\nVorstag\r\nWilhelm",
