  "descriptionHtml": "I always like to have a mod like this before. back when i don't know how to make mods yet i searched for a mod that makes dragon armor stronger than daedric but found none. So i made this mod. I really like dragon armor more than other armor especially when dragonborn dlc is released cause when you wear full set of dragon armor plus using the shout dragon aspect, its awesome that why i like dragon more.\n<br />\n<br />I also added a Dragonplate warrior near Gjukars monument which is hostile but great if you want the dragonplate armor early like me.But the dragonplate warrior is not recommended for low level players as he's level is 45(same where we can find dragonplate armor/weapon) and levels up to 250.\n<br />He has the same resistances/perks and spells like the ebony warrior with a few exceptions:\n<br />he don't have a healing spell/healing potion and conjuration spell.\n<br />he knows the dragon aspect shout and fire breath.\n<br />he don't have the reflect blows perk and paralysis perk from his weapons.\n<br />he is immune to Mehrunes razor instant kill,unrelenting force and he is immune to reanimation spells like dead thrall.\n<br />\n<br />His drops is the same as the ebony warrior except:\n<br />he don't drop all the gems but instead he drops 10 flawless diamonds,10 gold ingots and 10 black soul gems.\n<br />he drops 5000 gold\n<br />he drops 10 jarrin root and 10 daedric heart and 1 human heart.\n<br />he also drops 250 lockpicks\n<br />\n<br />He wears a full unique enchanted dragonplate armor and weapons.",
