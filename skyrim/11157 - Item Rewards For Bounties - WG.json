  "descriptionHtml": "[center][url=http://www.skyrimgems.com][img]http://SkyrimGEMS.com/images/badge_featured_500.png[/img][/url][/center]\r\n\r\nI\\'ve always thought that bounty rewards were underwhelming - Item Rewards For Bounties makes bounty quest rewards much more interesting and unpredictable, while being level appropriate and balanced.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a random leveled item as a reward upon quest completion, and changes bounty rewards to 250 gold for Bandits/Forsworn, 500 gold for Giants and 750 gold for dragons. \r\n\r\nLeveled item rewards include one of the following:\r\n\r\nBoots\r\nCuirass\r\nGauntlets\r\nHelmet\r\nShield\r\nArrows\r\nEnchanted Circlets\r\nRare Alchemy Ingredients (up to 2)\r\nPoisons\r\nPotions\r\nEnchanted Necklaces\r\nEnchanted Rings\r\nEnchanted Robes\r\nEnchanted Weapons\r\nScrolls\r\nFilled Soul Gems (No black soul gems)\r\nStaffs\r\nBows\r\nSpell Tomes (Novice, Apprentice, Adept - no Expert or Master tomes)\r\nEmpty Soul Gems (No black soul gems - up to 2)\r\n1-Handed Weapons\r\n2-Handed Weapons\r\nUncommon Alchemy Ingredients (up to 4)\r\nCommon Alchemy Ingredients (up to 5)\r\n\r\nNOTE: If you have a bounty quest in your quest log prior to installing the mod, you will get the old rewards, and you won\\'t get an item. Make sure to have this mod installed before you accept any bounty quests, and keep it activated through the whole quest.\r\n\r\nALSO NOTE: This mod works automatically for most people, but some people do not receive items, only the proper gold amount. If you experience this, please see the following section:\r\n\r\nIF THIS MOD IS NOT WORKING FOR YOU: Go to this file on the Skyrim Nexus here and try installing it from there, along with a fix I\\'ve posted there. http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11157\r\n\r\nTry the optional BQScript Fix 1 and 2 files I have uploaded. Try 1 first, just placing the BQScript.pex into your Skyrim/Data/Scripts folder and then testing the mod again.\r\n\r\nIf this doesn\\'t work, try Fix 2, which is replacing the default BQScript.psc file in the Skyrim/Data/Scripts/Source folder. BACK UP THE ORIGINAL FILE, and preferably BACK UP THE WHOLE FOLDER BEFORE YOU ATTEMPT THIS. I don\\'t want to be responsible for having to reinstall the game because I didn\\'t tell you to back up the file first :).\r\n\r\nFix 1 is confirmed to work (thanks talcottparsons!).\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the Creation Kit automatically bundles modified existing scripts into .bsa files, such as BQScript, which this quest modifies. For some installs of Skyrim, these scripts must float freely for Skyrim to properly recognize them (many thanks to Samutz for this info!).\r\n\r\nVersion: 1.11\r\nAuthor: Warrior G0el\r\n\r\nI love clear feedback, good or bad! Let me know if there\\'s anything else you\\'d like to see in this mod, or any bugs that I can fix.\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\n1.0 (Release) - Changes bounty rewards to 250 gold for Bandits/Forsworn, 500 gold for Giants and 750 gold for dragons. It also adds a random leveled item as a reward upon quest completion.\r\n1.1 - Changes bounty reward for dragons to 1000 gold.\r\n1.11 - Fixes a bug where items were not properly rewarded for completing bounties.\r\n\r\nThanks very much!\r\n\r\nOther WG Mods:\r\n\r\nUndying Companions: Makes all companions essential, meaning they cannot die by friendly or hostile damage. Exceptions: Erandur, Cicero and Eola.\r\n\r\nBreezehome Enchanting Table - Adds an enchanting table to Breezehome right next to the Alchemy Lab. Will only show up once Alchemy Lab decoration is purchased from Proventus in Dragonsreach. Mood lighting included.\r\n\r\nEnhanced Alchemy XP - Slightly increases Alchemy XP gain rate (20%) to balance with other skills such as Smithing. Still balanced, more fun.\r\n\r\nImproved Imperial Racial Abilities - Changes Voice of the Emperor ability to a +10 Speech bonus for people like me who never use Voice of the Emperor when they roll Imperial characters.\r\n\r\nVisible Slaughterfish - Makes only slaughterfish 3x bigger so you can see them more easily.\r\n\r\nEvil Slaughterfish - Makes slaughterfish much more dangerous: 3x damage, 2.5x speed, 3.1x attack chance and 2x health.\r\n\r\nSkyscraper Giants - Makes giants 3x bigger.\r\n\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/WarriorG0el/myworkshopfiles/",
