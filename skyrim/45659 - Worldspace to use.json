  "descriptionHtml": "Requirements: Newest version of Skyrim, Dawnguard\r\n\r\nThis modder resource contains one preety spacious worldspace: Kersilivas. It has its own climate. All the objects added by it have name starting with \"KER\" - this involves object from other modder resources . This worldspace haven't got LOD or Navmesh generated. There are 2 interiors done - cathedra and a corridor which is neccesary to see the part of Ker'silivas. A placeholder entrance to it is located in riverwood ( amazingly big statue, impossible to miss) - it takes You to a small Island where You can take a boat to the much larger part of this world.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 parts of world that are undone to let You create whatever you want there. One is on the top of a mountain the second one envolves an unfinished road which opens a possibility of making the worldspace more complex.\r\n\r\nAll Creation Kit warnings does not affect working of this modder resource.\r\n\r\nIf You noticed any buggs ( object misplaced) feel free to inform me in the comments and I am going to fix them as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\n\r\nProject Hoddminir team for publishing their useful resources ( Elinen, Ztree)\r\nStroti for his cathedra\r\nBlary for his wall art and opened books resources.\r\n\r\nFeel free to make a use out of it ( consider crediting me but it's not necesarry) I am also looking for a bit of feedback",
