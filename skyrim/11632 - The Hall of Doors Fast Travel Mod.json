  "descriptionHtml": "The hall of doors is an underground hallway that has shortcuts to 20 of the most important places in skyrim.  It allows you to fast travel without using the map.  But beware, the hall is crawling with dangerous creatures.  You will have to get past them if you want to use it to get around skyrim.  \r\n\r\nNote: The hall of doors version 1.50 is now available!  It adds 10 new shortcuts to the hall of doors.  It also adds a blacksmith forge so you can forge armor and weapons on the go.   \r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get to the hall of doors if you haven\\'t been there before would be to go through the trap door in farengar\\'s office in dragonsreach.  It\\'s hidden behind the map of skyrim but shouldn\\'t be too hard to find.  It is locked but the key is somewhere very nearby.\r\n\r\nThe hall of doors has shortcuts to\r\n\r\nversion 1.50\r\nJorrvaskr the Companions hall in Whiterun\r\nJorrvaskr living quarters\r\nThe Underforge in whiterun\r\nSovngarde \r\nThe Guardian Stones\r\nWinterhold College Arch Mages Quarters\r\nThe Bards College in Solitude\r\nThe Dawnstar Sanctuary\r\nTheives Guild Headquarters in Riften\r\nThe Atronach Forge in the Midden at the college of winterhold\r\n\r\nversion 1.00\r\nDragonsreach in whiterun\r\nThe palace of the kings in windhelm\r\nmistveil keep in riften\r\nthe white hall in dawnstar\r\nthe jarls longhouse in winterhold\r\nthe jarls longhouse in falkreath\r\nhightmoonhall in morthal\r\nthe blue palace in solitude\r\nunderstone keep in markarth\r\nhigh hrother\r\ncastle dour in solitude\r\nthe hall of elements at the college of winterhold\r\nthe hall of attainment at the college of winterhold\r\nthe hall of countenance at the college of winterhold\r\nthe sleeping giant inn in riverwood\r\nsky haven temple\r\nthe dark brotherhood sanctuary\r\nblackreach\r\nthe ragged flagon in riften\r\nthe top of the throat of the world\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n-This mod can screw up some quests.  If this happens load your previous save and use the map to get to where you need to go.\r\n- If you use the hall of doors to get back to dragonsreach right before the battle of whiterun during the legion quest after delivering Jarl Baalgruf\\'s axe to Ulfric Stormcloak it will cause the imperial commander to disapear.  Go through the front door to avoid this.\r\n\r\nNote that this is not a cheating mod.  You cannot use the hall to fast travel to a place you have not been before.  You have to go to that place first and then find the key to the trap door in that area that leads back to the hall of doors.  After that you can travel back and forth from that place as many times as you please.\r\n\r\n",
