  "descriptionHtml": "now you can wear the banner of an Elite. This version is completely ready to replace the old shieldn of the Skeleton knight\n<br />DARK SOULS 4 LORE SAYS: \n<br />\n<br />\"The dark feathered Raven is often an auger of doom. But in this case, the Raven represents a dogged conviction to work towards a goal, no matter the cost.\n<br />\n<br />It has been said that any man who tastes Dragons Blood may speak to birds, and the Raven is the most learned in this art. No wonder that it is also said that the Raven is wisest among the animals.\n<br />\n<br />With his broken sword, the descending Raven falls upon his foes. Unwilling to admit defeat he trudges onward into danger. \n<br />\n<br />Be wise. Steal from Eagles. Be cunning and be brave.\"\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0w9q125TSI\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />all credits to Dummy for making the skeleton knight, which you absolutely need for this to work. If you wish to keep the skull knight shield in tact, only drop ONE of the texture files into its place. The one with spaces (I.e. Skeleton knight) is for the heavy shield. the one without, Skeletonknight is the light shield. Likewise, drop the Skeleton knight_n or Skeletonknight_n in with it, depending on which shield you wish to replace.\n<br />\n<br />Knight of Skeleton armor\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62948\n<br />\n<br />the stick figure drawings are homage to Xerperious who makes excellent mods and has helped me out a lot. He asked me to draw him some stick men on bad paper, so I did as requested. Thanks for your help man. \n<br />Here's a link to his Fashionsouls 3 thrall axe (for skyrim).
