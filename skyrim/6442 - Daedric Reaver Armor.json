  "descriptionHtml": "-== MIKAELS DAEDRIC ARMOR ==- [RE-TEXTURE]\r\n\r\nWhat happens when you play Sponge Bob\\'s The Best Day Ever on repeat while in photoshop? This armor. \r\n\r\nThe goal here was to create a re-texture for the daedric armor set that looked like a more powerful deadra would be wearing it but still maintain the Elder Scroll/Skyrim type of style. I originally got the idea to start this armor by looking at a picture of a Xivilai from Oblivion but then I started making my own little changes to it. This armor is not for everyone but if you like it then I hope you enjoy it and endorse the file so that others can see it and use it. It was important for me to try and keep the armor looking like it fit in the world which I hope I did. I personally am not a fan of using mods etc that don\\'t look like they belong in the game but everyone has their own preferences so to each his own. I don\\'t mind suggestions and I plan on doing the shield next, I haven\\'t started it yet but it shouldn\\'t take me more than a day or two to finish it and upload it. Like I said I hope you all enjoy it, kill a lot of people in skyrim with it and don\\'t forget to endorse.\r\n\r\n\r\n-== Compatibility ==-\r\n*This Armor re-texture can be used with both Male and Females\r\n*There should be no issues with other mods unless the other mods modify Daedric armor textures or meshes\r\n\r\n\r\n-== Installation ==-\r\n*Extract the files into your Skyrim/data folder or use the Nexus Mod Manager\r\n\r\n\r\n-== 1.1 Released Changes Below  ==-\r\n1) Added wear and tear to all parts of the armor as optional download \r\n2) Adjusted eye sockets so they no longer shine annoyingly around the eyes \r\n3) Fixed Eye from sticking out \\\"derpy\\\" adjusted position, increased detail around the eye\r\n4) Added dirty layer to leather flaps in front and back as well as decreasing the vibrance/saturation from each to be more level with the armor \r\n5) Adjusted Environmental Effects \r\n6) Added entirely new normal maps for better shadows and Ambient Occlusion. An noticeable increase in quality and depth.\r\n8)Adjusted the Intensity of the Reds\r\n\r\n\r\n-== Future Updates ==-\r\n*Daedric Shield Retexture\r\n*Don\\'t know yet\r\n*Get Mountain Dew\r\n\r\nThank you \\\"Sanguivore\\\" for the name idea for the armor.\r\n",
