I was mindful that I had left the mods unfinished and figured I could do a quick update/clean and wrap them up.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]I came across [/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32363/?][size=3]Grand Bulwark’s page on which he had WZ listed in the “blacklist”[/size][/url][size=3]… so I wrote him a note which said, in a nutshell:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]“Put up or shut up.”[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]More precisely, I invited him to explain – exactly – what the trouble with WZv5B was, how it could be fixed (now with the benefit of 2 years advances in Skyrim tech) and if he was using the buzz-terms “dirty edits”, “bloated save” and whatever other ones properly or if he was just vomiting back what he’d “heard” and perpetuating the rumor-mill.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Turns out, he opted to “put up” and now we’re buddies.  Grand Bulwark recruited our team and with our combined knowledge and efforts, we have rebuilt WARZONES.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Had I not found a collaborator as interested in collaboration as he was, I would have just run WZ through TESVEDIT, removed the helper and been done with it. But he was excited to repair and expand WZ… and here we are.[/size]\r<br />[size=3] [/size]\r<br />[color=#ffe599][size=3][b]WZv5B : THE PROBLEMS AND MY MOOD AT THE TIME :[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]WZv5B worked for a load of people.  There were stalwart defenders of the mod here in the comments for years after I &#34;left&#34; all of which would say &#34;it works if you do a, b and c&#34;.  And, obviously, there were the detractors that, for whatever reasons legitimately had problems with WZv5B.  Honestly, I expect some of that to happen again.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]I’m not saying that WZv5B wasn’t flawed – in fact, it was “unclean” because TESVEDIT wasn’t available at the time to clean the mod…  WZv5B wasn’t updated to the final version of the game – because the game wasn’t “final”…[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]When we decided to revisit it, we found that there really was only one major problem and that was the Helper ([url=http://mygoodeyenyc.com/WarzonesCivilUnrest/mcm-replaces-the-god-of-warzones/]The God of Warzones[/url]).[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]There were other bits of sloppiness that became evident as I deconstructed what I’d done.  It was obvious that there were some “growing pains” left within the mod (y’know, a variety of methods to do the same thing as I’d developed and learned)…[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]… the scripts were tight (improved now with more fail-safes) and the framework was overall fine… but that it was a HUGE mod – and most users are ignorant of how resources are used – I found myself in a defensive position…[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]… and being in a defensive position on a hobby is hardly worth the energy. I became disinterested in helping those that refused to help themselves. And REALLY tired of explaining the notion that a 32-bit game engine (pre ENBBOOST and SKSE memory hacks) has limitations… like a cup, you can only fill it so much before it spills over…[/size]\r<br />[size=3] [/size]\r<br />[size=3]…AND NOW :WZv5B wasn’t as f*cked as its reputation, but with the help of Deapri, Grand Bulwark and Tony971, I’ve rescripted most of it, killed the “helper”, added an MCM, added TONS more dynamic WZs, random WZs, daytime WZs, nighttime WZs, WZs that only show up every now and again, so on so forth.  Many of the “original WZs” remain, but are now more randomized making it not “always on”.  It’s really pretty exciting…[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]- David (MyGoodEye)[/size]\r<br />[img]http://www.mygoodeyenyc.com/modImages/skyrim_Warzones/WARZONES_subs_divider4.png[/img]\r<br />[color=#ffd966][size=4][b]INSTALLATION DOCUMENTATION:[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]You may have noticed that the page is full of links...
