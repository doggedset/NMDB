  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://s7.directupload.net/images/140707/mc97ffmr.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />VERSION HISTORY:\r<br />\r<br />v0.8: The DRAGONBORN DLC is required now&#33; I decided to do this because the dlc adds a lot of great Dunmer clutter that can be used in the Gray Quarter. As well, I added a merchant to the market stall in front of the Candleheart Inn. The poor woman stays there the whole day atm, I&#39;ll try to give here a daily routine in the future. I also fixed some Navmeshes and some minor issues and, well, added even more clutter...\r<br />\r<br />v0.5: Release\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />DESCRIPTION:\r<br />\r<br />I always had the feeling that there&#39;s too much free room and insufficient snow in the city that is meant to be the coldest and oldest in Skyrim (or whole Tamriel?). And because I didn&#39;t find any Windhelm-Mod that makes it look like my feeling says it should be, I decided to make my own one. ;-)\r<br />I added a huge amount of snow, icicles, containers, plants and other stuff to give some areas a more realistic and inhabited feeling, combined with the need to survive the harsh climate. \r<br />Now there&#39;s a lot more snow in the whole city, especially at spots that aren&#39;t used a lot. I also added a few braziers and other light and heat sources as well as moooore firewood&#33; I decided to change some places like the blacksmith&#39;s place and the area between the Candlelight Inn and the gate to make them more interessting and less .. ew.. video-game-like.\r<br />The overhaul fits perfectly with mod&#39;s like Frostfall, that make the cold weather in Skyrim more consistent.\r<br />\r<br />I guess the Mod WILL decrease the FPS on older systems because I added a really huge amount of static meshes etc.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />COMPATIBILITY;\r<br />\r<br />The mod will be incompatible with any other Windhelm-Overhaul for sure, so please don&#39;t try to combine them&#33;&#33;&#33; :-) But beyond that, it should be compatible with almost everything out there, as I didn&#39;t change any markers set by Bethesda, scripts, NPCs, transitions etc and hopefully made a fully functional Navmesh. \r<br />\r<br />Minor issues I&#39;ve already spotted:\r<br />\r<br />-One of the Laborers added in the Mod &#34;Inconsequential NPCs&#34; will fetch some wood through a wall. Well, that&#39;s not really beautiful but shouldn&#39;t downgrade your game&#39;s experience THAT much&#33;\r<br />\r<br />-If you have got &#34;Faction: Pit Fighters&#34; installed, there will be a chopping block in front of the door that leads to the Windhelm Arena Training Hall. This shouldn&#39;t be a problem since it doesn&#39;t prevent you from entering the building.\r<br />\r<br />-&#34;Realistic Lighting Overhaul&#34; added some extra embers to a brazier which moved a few meters in my mod. Because of that the embers just hang in the air. That&#39;s a bit weird but I won&#39;t change anything because of that. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The mod is shown in SkyttsTV&#39;s &#34;Skyrim Mods Weekly 6&#34; - Thank you very much for that&#33;\r<br />[youtube]eBNpiJK1ILM[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />My Screenshots are rather crap... would be happy to see some nice ones by you&#33; ;-)\r<br />\r<br />That should be everything for now...\r<br />Have fun&#33;",
