  "descriptionHtml": "This mod makes it so that you can craft all of the stahlrim light armor and weapons as long as you have the Ebony Smithing Perk OR the Glass Smithing Perk. \r<br />\r<br />It always annoyed me that even though it contained a light armor set and the lore stated that it was thought to be &#34;enchanted ice&#34; (sounds more like glass than ebony to me), you had to be able to smith ebony. So.... I added them to the glass perk as well as the ebony.\r<br />\r<br />P.S: If you like this mod, please endorse, check out my other mod &#34;Better Soul Trap&#34; found here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50943/?\r<br />Or my YouTube channel: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT5WaaWx8I8oBcbFxCkRQ1w?feature=watch",
