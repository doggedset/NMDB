  "descriptionHtml": "Very simple mod to make unarmed combat stronger. This is done by adding perk levels to Fists of Steel with 2x, 3x, 4x, and 5x additional unarmed damage from your heavy gauntlets. \r\n\r\nUsing this mod alone will boost the damage cap for unarmed combat into the low 100\\'s ... which i believe is reasonable when compared to the damage cap for other weapon types.\r\n\r\nI made this for my own use but figured I\\'d throw it up here in case anyone was interested.",
