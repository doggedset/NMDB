  "descriptionHtml": "A mod to summon a tiger in Skyrim. Actually I had the idea of making the tiger smaller in size but guess the results in game doesn\\'t look good lol so I reverted it back to its default size. The tiger textures is the work of  muppetpuppet. I have included his textures in this file and NMM friendly. However, all other sabre cats will also look like a tiger, its a common texture in use by the game anyway.\r\nSo credits to  muppetpuppet for his tiger textures. Visit his mod link via - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10473\r\n\r\nIf you plan to install muppetpuppet tiger retexture manually, you need to rename the dds from sabretiger.dds to sabrecat.dds and the tiger skin texture will work for you in game.",
