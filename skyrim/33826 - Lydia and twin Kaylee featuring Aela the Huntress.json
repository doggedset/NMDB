  "summary": "Lydia facelift and twin sister Kaylee.  Added Aela with only the face, so you can use your preferable body mod.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Please endorse if you like this mod.  I\\'m not doing an adult version because I care too much for these two ladies.\r\n\r\n=== Credits and Thanks ===\r\nPlease click the PERMS icon on the ACTIONS list above.\r\n\r\n=== Required Mods ===\r\nLydia and Kaylee mod won\\'t work without [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]ApachiiSkyHairFemale[/url].  The Apachii mod\\'s full main file will not work, so search for ApachiiSkyHairFemale from the Apachii mod\\'s file section.\r\n\r\nAela requires the following, and it will not work without them.\r\no  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31797]Ponytail Hairstyles[/url] by Azar \r\no  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722]The Eyes Of Beauty NPC[/url] by Gabriel Mailhot is optional but highly recommended \r\n\r\n=== Installation ===\r\nPlease use the mod manager download if you have it because that will automatically install. The main file section has the required main DL file and updates.  Use either the CBBE DL or the UNP DL.\r\n\r\n=== For manual Installation ===\r\nDownload the main DL file and update files under the main section, and unzip them to the skyrim/data directory. \r\n\r\n=== Why this mod ===\r\nLydia was walking like a man, and unchecking the \\\"opposite gender anim\\\" option did not reset her when I loaded a previous save.  This led me to this creation of Kaylee.\r\n\r\n=== What is this mod ===\r\nI created Kaylee who is a duplicate of Lydia, so she can walk like a lady.  I also gave her a complete face and body overhaul.  Because she and Lydia is twin in this mod, this mod also gave Lydia the exact same overhaul.  This mod left Lydia\\'s \\\"opposite gender anim\\\" alone, so she still has the manly walk.\r\n\r\nKaylee will be available much sooner than Lydia, so she should be waiting for you at Draonsreach at the beginning.  She is a ranger, but the game AI favored sword and shield.  \r\n\r\nBoth Kaylee and Lydia is using the CBBE v3.2.3 Underwear body or the UNP swimsuit body, so they would be wearing bra and panty when stripped.  Please be gentle with Kaylee and Lydia because they are very dear to me.  This is why I\\'m using the bsa format, and I\\'m not intent to release unpacked files.  For the UNP body, you may see some texture color band at the neck area when you extremely zoomed in.\r\n\r\nAfter a long consideration, I have decided to include Aela facelift I\\\"ve tweaked and been using.  Aela has only the face files, so she\\'ll use your default body mod.  Aela face texture has been blend to the CBBE, so you may see some neck seam with other body like UNP.  \r\n\r\n=== Recommended mods ===\r\nUFO: both Lydia and Kaylee as followers.  The latest version will play idle anim, and it plays nervious looking around anim constantly.  This can be annoying, so to remedy this on my  PC I replaced these files on my PC.  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037\r\nATF: same as UFO, but I had some problems towing followers.  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15524\r\nThe latest tweaked Aela look was inspired by m0ckin9bird\\'s companion mods. http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30938",
