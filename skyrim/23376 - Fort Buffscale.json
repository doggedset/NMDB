  "descriptionHtml": "Got #7 on a Top ten best houses mod!  Thanks Machinima!!!\r\n\r\n[youtube]RS0AN6l9eOc[/youtube]\r\n\r\nA Dwemer inspired home, has pipe elevators, two prisons, and a giant main hall\r\n\r\nThe main hall is College of Winterhold inspired partly, but with Dwemer parts.  Has custom Dwarven mechanisms including Sweetroll dispensers and...sex machines.  Mainly as a tongue in cheek joke, but they exist regardless.\r\n\r\nThe exterior has all the crafting utilities outside so you dont have to fight your followers over the forge or alchemy lab.  You can access the roof via a pipe elevator in the back.  On top it has a fire-able giant Ballista.  Not sure if the arrows respawn.\r\n\r\nPrison number 1 has various nude females in it.  They really only exist for sex mods, but I guess you can use follower mods on them too.\r\n\r\nPrison number 2 has a lot of enemies and button activated traps for fun.  You can chop bandits to bits with Dwemer slicers, blow up Forsworn with Ballistas, and even fry Thalmor with wall mounted flamethrowers.  Not 100% sure if they respawn or not once killed.\r\n\r\nOh, to gain access to the main hall, you need to kill a monstrous troll named Lehmahn the Horrible.  He is level 1000 and quite strong.  Hahah.\r\n\r\nSept. 3rd update:\r\n\r\nAdded Dawnguard elements to house\r\nRedid upper balcony area.  Got rid of some chests up there.  If you had items in those chests clear them out or dont use this update.  You will lose your stuff.\r\nAdded bookshelves\r\nAdded Dragon skeleton display\r\nAdded large weapon display case in front of dragon skeleton\r\nAdded weapon display racks on either side of throne.  Teensy weensy bit finicky to work with\r\nAdded new room in preparation for Hearthfire\\'s adoption system\r\nAdded level 500 Steam centurions (Five) on exterior to keep intruders away.  This area seems to get attacked by random things a LOT.\r\nAdded bone piles to the torture room to make em nice n scary\r\nAdded a \\\"Fun button\\\" on the roof.  Press it to see what it does!\r\nAlso added a Soul Cairn gem in a little cage in the back of the fort.  Purely aesthetics, does not drain HP.\r\n\r\nSept, 17 update: - Getting ready for Hearthfire!\r\n\r\nAdded two rooms for children, moved the \\\"Sex machines\\\" to a different room\r\nAdded a cellar, complete with treasure vault, \\\"incinerator\\\" for deleting unwanted items (might take a while), and put the sex machines in a locked area accessible via a button\r\nAdded a Bedroom for the player\r\nREMOVED SEVERAL CHESTS from the main hall.  If you have items in them, clean the chests out before installing this update!!!  Replaced them with beds.\r\nTotally overhauled lighting for main hall\r\nAdded a new place called \\\"The pit\\\".  Mainly for fun, can send things down a bottomless pit with a lever and button.  Has trolls in it to demonstrate at first.\r\nOverhauled the dungeon with the female NPCs to look more like a kitchen.\r\nAdded a trap door to the dungeon that leads to an area filled with nude Thalmor women\r\nThis update includes the TOBORs.  They are followers but are rather OP.  I use them solely for their Spess mahreeny appeal when using all Dwarven gear.\r\n\r\nMay 2, 2013 update.  Possibly final update!\r\n\r\nA major overhaul of my fort mod.\r\n\r\n--THIS UPDATE REQUIRES ALL DLC, YES, ALL. DLC.--\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\nPit changed into Dwemer AI facility.  They are all master level trainers, and can train you to level 100 in every skill.  Some of them are a little glitchy, but waiting an hour will generally fix them.\r\nRemoved empty bedroom area and replaced it with Divine Statues and such\r\nRemoved room that was wasting space and turned it into a Staff Enchanting station on the outside\r\nPrison was changed into a cell named \\\"Servant\\'s quarters\\\" and filled with some oddities such as very friendly ghosts\r\nMajor structural changes to the exterior, with a giant wall constructed, a giant tower, etc.  Dragon perching for top of fort.  Dragon fights more realistic now!  \r\nALSO if you have Command Dragon installed, you can use the giant tower as a DRAGON LANDING PAD!  YES, YOU HEARD RIGHT.  A WORKING DRAGON LANDING PAD.  GO ON, TRY IT.",
