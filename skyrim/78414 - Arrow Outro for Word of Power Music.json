  "summary": "",
  "descriptionHtml": "This should work...\r<br />This mod replaces two of the three word of power songs (MUS_Special_WordOfPower_01 and MUS_Special_WordOfPower_03) with a clip of the outro theme from the TV series Arrow. It has a 50% chance of playing when you absorb a dragon soul or learn a Word of Power, otherwise the default song I left in will play.\r<br />\r<br />I liked this theme, and I though it was fitting, so I put it in my game, and then decided to upload it in case anybody else wants it. If anybody wants a version without the original song at all, or if anyone wants a different song entirely, I can do so easily. Also, I might add a video to this page in the future.\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t expect any problems with this, since it is very simple. If a problem does show up, comment about it if you want.\r<br />",
