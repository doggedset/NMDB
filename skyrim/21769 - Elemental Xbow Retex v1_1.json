  "summary": "Modifies the explosive steel and Dwemer bolts so they don\\'t get mixed with the regular variant. Also includes Dwemer quiver.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Introduction-\r\n*After uploading this file I found another mod that changes the Dwemer quiver just as mine does. by Ashigi. Though I did not use his version I felt that I should give him a shout out since his was here first. Either version should work...but if you want to use both of them I guess load his after mine to overwrite my quiver. I am not trying to step all over him but I had not noticed until I uploaded my Version 1.1.*\r\n\r\nHello all!\r\nI have created this mod to address the pressing issue...how in the world does the dawnguard keep all their Xbow bolts organized? This stems from me switching in mid combat to a different ammo type and not noticing, until I fire an elemental bolt into a group of people and realizing that I had just pissed everyone off and now they are trying to kill me. \r\n\r\nThis mod replaces the vanilla exploding STEEL bolt textures with something that I whipped up real quick to try and help myself notice the difference in the bolts.\r\n\r\nTo Install-\r\nextract everything into the Skyrim folder, is should work itself out...I think I put everything in the right order. (not sure how to set up mods for the mod manager...probably real simple too.)\r\n\r\nFuture plans-\r\n-Dwemer bolts (finished)\r\n-Custom Crossbows\r\n-Custom bolts\r\n-more magic effects\r\n-clean up images\r\n\r\nPermissions-\r\nYou all can use this as you see fit. if you do use it in another mod, please just put a little nod to me. nothing special needed really.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd of course thank you Bethesda for the game...and FINALLY releasing Dawnguard to the PC community.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
