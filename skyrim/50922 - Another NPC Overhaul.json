  "descriptionHtml": "My first mod so please don&#39;t be TOO harsh.\r<br />Cleaned with TES5Edit\r<br />\r<br />&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;IMPORTANT&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />For those that downloaded the original this new version may have some conflicts, as such before uninstalling and reinstalling be in a place where there are no NPCs (i.e. Skuldafn).  As a last resort you MAY have to start a new game.\r<br />\r<br />What this mod does:\r<br />Gives NPCs either Essential or Protected status.  I have given most npcs, specifically Quest NPCs, a level increase up to 100, meaning they will not fall as quickly, this is meant to defend against accidental &#34;killing&#34; especially when there is a dragon involved. Follower NPCs (with very few exceptions) have been uncapped as well meaning followers will now level with you to infinity. This mod will be especially useful if you have a mod that increases difficulty (i.e. Sands of Time, High Level Enemies, etc).  In the case of brawls the fights will be somewhat harder but not impossible, I made sure of that.  If there are any mod conflicts please let me know immediately so I can fix it.\r<br />\r<br />Required Mods:\r<br />Skyrim\r<br />Dawnguard\r<br />Hearthfire\r<br />Dragonborn\r<br />USKP\r<br />ApachiiSkyhair (Only needed if you choose the file w/ apachii Hair)\r<br />\r<br />To Do list:\r<br />Apachii Hair Implementation\r<br />Immersive Patrols\r<br />Populated Series (for those that may still have it)\r<br />Inconsequential NPCs\r<br />Face Morphing\r<br />\r<br />While I tried my best to ensure that there would be no conflicts with quests or other bug workarounds there is bound to be something I missed.  Please let me know immediately which character it is so I can fix the problem.  For those that had/have the &#34;original&#34; mod, I have &#34;rebooted&#34; the mod due to conflicts with other mods (I.E. USKP, hence the requirement), as well as made a different version for those that do not have/want apachii hair.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Download with NMM, or if manual and place the .esp in the Skyrim Data folder.  Be sure to activate the mod in the NMM or the Skyrim Launcher.\r<br />\r<br />Load Order:\r<br />The .esp should be placde in the middle to lower half of your load order.  To be sure the .esp is in the right place go to Whiterun and use the &#34;KillAll&#34; console command, if certain npcs die immediately (i.e. Idolaf Battle Born) put the .esp lower and try again.\r<br />\r<br />Mod Conflicts:\r<br />There should be no mod conflicts as I only changed NPCs stats (so far).\r<br />\r<br />Update 7/18/2014:\r<br />I need help I am running into the head/body color bug on certain characters when I am adding the Apachii Hair and I do not change anything else. Before anyone asks I did do the facegen command in the CK but nothing shows up, and I am doing it right.  Any advice is welcome. \r<br />\r<br />Recommended Mods:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6709/?]UNPBase[/url] by Dimon99\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?]ApachiiSkyHair[/url] by Apachii\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2488/?]Better Males[/url] by Chris 57\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22616/?]The Hirelings[/url] by Netherwalk\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40038/?]Bjinn Warmaidens[/url] by rxkx22",
