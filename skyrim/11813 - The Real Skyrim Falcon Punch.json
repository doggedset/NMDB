  "descriptionHtml": "----- THE REAL SKYRIM FALCON PUNCH V 1.2 -----\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 2012\r\n\r\n====================\r\nDescription\r\n====================\r\nThis mod gives the Dovahkiin the power of Captain Falcon! Now he (or she) can Falcon Punch enemies into outer-space!\r\n(Watch the video for the actual effects, words don\\'t do it justice)\r\n\r\n[youtube]HiR16DfoGdQ[/youtube]\r\n\r\n- New conjuration spell: Falcon Fist\r\n- Falcon Fist can be cast on either hand. Once cast, each attack is a Falcon Punch!\r\n- Yes, every time you punch you\\'ll hear \\\"Falcon Pawwnnch\\\"!\r\n- Falcon Fist works like any bound weapon, Unequipping will dispel the effects.\r\n- Using Falcon Fist will increase your conjuration and one-handed skills.\r\n[b]\r\n- To get the spell, climb up to the Throat of the World (highest point next to Notch\\'s Pickaxe) and pick up the tome.\r\n- If you\\'re too impatient to climb the mountain, open the console and type \\\"player.additem xxx006E5D 1\\\" where xxx is the load order*.[/b]\r\n[color=\\\"red\\\"]*See FAQ section below[/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n====================\r\nVersion History\r\n====================\r\n1.2\r\n- You can now Falcon Punch horses into orbit.\r\n- Added sound effect.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n1.1 Mystic Binding / Soul Steal compatible. Punching increases conjuration and one-handed skills. Increased compatibility.\r\n1.0\tFirst official release now with time warp effect\r\n0.9\tTime warp script created, adjusted forces for regular humans & giants\r\n0.8\tAdded Falcon Punch sound effects to fist swings, special thanks to firecircle2002 for telling me wave file formats\r\n0.7\tMade a preliminary video using the mod, relocated punch explosion to player instead\r\n0.6\tComplete overhaul, Falcon Fist is now a spell, punch explosion effects added\r\n0.5\tCreated new unarmed weapon titled \\\"falcon_fist\\\" for punch effect scripts - first working version\r\n0.4\tAdopted wabbajack script to use as base falcon punch script, gold spawning does not work - Scott Pilgrim homage abandoned\r\n0.3\tAttempt to create force push effect with enchanted ring failed. Player gets falcon punch on self when ring is worn\r\n0.2\tRepurposed dibella_touch spell to do falcon punch instead\r\n0.1\tAttempt to create masturbation spell failed due to inability to add new animations\r\n\r\n\r\n====================\r\nInstallation\r\n====================\r\nExtract the Data folder into your skyrim installation path. Make sure you don\\'t turn off your computer while the file is copying.\r\n\r\n\r\n====================\r\nUninstallation\r\n====================\r\nDelete the file falcon_punch.esp and falcon_punch.bsa from Skyrim\\\\Data folder. Make sure you don\\'t spill coffee on your\r\ncomputer while the file is deleting.\r\n\r\n\r\n====================\r\nBugs & To-Do\\'s\r\n====================\r\n- Duel casting Falcon Fist at the same time might cause errors with the sound and / or function of the spell.\r\n- Using shield while Falcon Punching will sometimes produce unpredictable results. This is caused by the way Skyrim handles hit boxes and animations.\r\n- Enemies might sometimes get falcon punched before your fists land on them. Again this is caused by the way Skyrim handles hit boxes and animations.\r\n- Using shield bash while Falcon Fist is cast will produce the Falcon Punch sound effect. Currently I have no fix for this.\r\n- Punch essential characters at your own risk. While they won\\'t die, they might be thrown outside accessible areas and get stuck.\r\n- Mammoths and dragons are immune to the physical effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n====================\r\nMiscellaneous\r\n====================\r\nFalcon Punch should not conflict with existing mods unless they modify the world space around Throat of the World.\r\nMods that modify perks and spells might conflict with Falcon Punch depending on what they modified. If you find a conflict please inform me.\r\nThis is NOT a replacer mod. Nothing is replaced. All scripts, spells, magical and enchantment effects are original files.\r\n\r\n\\\"Captain Falcon\\\", \\\"Falcon Punch\\\", and associated sound effects are copyrighted properties of Nintendo.\r\n\\\"Skyrim\\\" and \\\"Elder Scrolls\\\" are copyrighted properties of Bethesda Softworks.\r\nIf you wish to use the scripts created by me for this mod, feel free. Though if you created something awesome with them, I\\'d be happy to share the credits.\r\n\r\nThis mod is provided \\\"as is\\\". By using this mod you agree to not hold me responsible should your computer(s)\r\na) explode, b) implode, c) develop sapience and kill you in your sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n====================\r\nFAQ\r\n====================\r\nQ: What is load order?\r\nA: Load order is the order in which a mod is loaded. When you click on \\\"Data Files\\\" in the Skyrim launcher, you should see a dialogue like this:\r\n[img]http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/3507/loadx.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nThe numbers in red correspond to the load order. The count starts at 2 because 0 & 1 are used by the vanilla game files. The count is in hexadecimal. In the picture above the load order of falcon punch is c.\r\n\r\nQ: What is hexadecimal?\r\nA: Hexadecimal is a base 16 number system commonly used in computing. The digits 0 - 9 correspond to their equivalent in base 10 decimal (regular numbers), followed by letters a-f corresponding to 10 - 15, totaling 16 numbers (hence hexadecimal, hexa means six, deci means ten).\r\n\r\nQ: Will you release a version without the Falcon Punch sound effects?\r\nA: No. Falcon Punch without the sounds would just be... regular punch.\r\n\r\nQ: Why doesn\\'t Falcon Punch work on Mammoths and Dragons?\r\nA: I honestly don\\'t know why Falcon Punch doesn\\'t throw Mammoths. Dragons are not thrown because it would be a hassle to chase down a flying corpse to get his soul. If I get a bunch of requests for dragon punching then I will make a separate version.\r\n\r\nQ: This mod is too overpowered! Y U no make lore friendly mods?\r\nA: That is not a question, and yes, this mod is overpowered. It\\'s meant to be funny and not adhere to Elder Scrolls lore.\r\n\r\nQ: This mod causes CTD when I launch Skyrim, what gives?\r\nA: I don\\'t know. It works perfectly on my PC. PM me a list of mods you\\'re using and I\\'ll see if I can find the problem. Or better yet, you try and figure out which mod(s) conflict with mine, and I\\'ll be able to fix the problem faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n====================\r\nContact Info\r\n====================\r\nIf you find bugs or have suggestions, leave a comment on Skyrim Nexus.",
