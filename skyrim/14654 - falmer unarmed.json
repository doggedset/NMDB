Now they attack you with their deadly claws. \r\nBut falmers like the shaman has still his spells and his armor. I try to change it too.\r\n\r\ninstallation:\r\nJust put the esp. in the data folder of your game and enable it with the mod-manager.\r\n \r\nI make the mod, cause the falmer in the game reminds me of the creatures in the movie \\\"the descent\\\" And they have no weapons or spells. In future i will make an \\\"the descent mod\\\"\r\n\r\nwhat i wanted\r\n---------------------------\r\n-all falmer have no weapons, armor or spells\r\n-soundeffects from the movie,\r\n-a cave map like in the movie, a labyrinth, with many tunnels, traps with falling rock just like in the movie.\r\n\r\nuntil this i have much to learn how to use the CK.
