  "descriptionHtml": "Warning: This mod requires Dawnguard.\r<br />\r<br />Aetherial Crown Redone is a mod that replaces the default Aetherial Crown effect (allowing the player to chose a second standing stone) with a new, unique effect. One of the main reasons I made this mod is because I am one of the many users of the Character Creation Overhaul (CCO), a fantastic mod. I use the permanent birthsigns portion of that mod, and as such, the original Aetherial Crown effect was useless to me (as the mod removes standing stones). However, this mod can also be used by any who simply want to try out this different effect.\r<br />\r<br />==========New Effect==========\r<br />\r<br />The Aetherial Crown&#39;s effect has been changed to the following:\r<br />\r<br />Slow time when equipped.\r<br />After removal, crown phases from existence for 5 * the time it was worn.\r<br />\r<br />The longer you wear the crown, the longer you need to wait to reuse it.\r<br />\r<br />==========Installation==========\r<br />\r<br />Simply copy all of the files to your Skyrim/Data directory and activate the ESP with the Skyrim Launcher or a mod manager.",
