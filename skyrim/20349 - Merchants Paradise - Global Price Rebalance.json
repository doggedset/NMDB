  "descriptionHtml": "This mod drastically raises all ingredient prices, including ingots and filled soulgems.\r\nSo if you want to level your Alchemy, Smithing, or Enchanting using vendor\\'s reagents,\r\nyou will need some perks of Speechcraft branch. Otherwise it\\'ll be VERY expensive.\r\n\r\nPrices are counted for all discount perks taken +20% discount from your equipment.\r\n\r\nBlack Soul Gems are for VIP-hunting only :-) Added to Falion in Morthal(10), Wunfert in Windhelm(10), Enthir n College(20).\r\n\r\nAt low levels some of Alchemy reagents better to sale than make smth of them.\r\n\r\nApothecaries have more ingredients than vanilla. Also they have especially much of ingredients common in their region.\r\n\r\nIngredient barrels, Falmers, Mages contain much more ingredients than vanilla.\r\n\r\n10x Giant\\'s Toes found will be a Jackpot!\r\n\r\nMage-Vendors have much more empty soulgems for sale.\r\n\r\nAll vendors have much more gold(Blacksmiths - 10000, Apothecaries - 15000, etc).\r\n\r\nHouse prices also increased.\r\n\r\nSo feel the poverty or become a Master Dealer!\r\n\r\nKnown issue - if the vendor has more gold than some amount(I don\\'t know how much exactly) it\\'s useless to sell him smth - you won\\'t get gold from him. \r\n\r\nNeed to \\\"heal\\\" this merchant with some shock or wait till he reset himself(3 days). I think it\\'s a bug of a game. Maybe it\\'s the reason why they haven\\'t enough gold in vanilla.\r\n\r\nPlease comment, maybe there is something to make it better.",
