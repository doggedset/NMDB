  "descriptionHtml": "I combined several mods into one so I can override all the values in one go by putting this at the bottom of the load order since these items are a huge hassle at default values. Some of the mods only had a weightless version as far as I could find here on nexusmods, but by adding no weight to those items it kind of eliminated the trips you&#39;d have to make to store stuff besides the items you loot from dungeons. \r<br />\r<br />I take no credit for this mod, I am merely supplying an all in one solution that was intended for personal use. This changes all values of vanilla items stated below\r<br />\r<br />This changes values of:\r<br />Potions & Poisons: 0,1 - ID list by JustinOther http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1036\r<br />Scrolls: 0,1 - ID list by JustinOther http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26959\r<br />Ingredients: 0,1 - ID list by jinjishu http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10460\r<br />Soulgems: 0,1 - ID list by jinjishu http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10483\r<br />Books: 0,1  - ID list by DaedricBiscuts http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26661\r<br />Dragon Bones/Scales: 1,0 (alternative: 3,0)\r<br />(Notched, Rocksplinter) Pickaxe and Woodcutting Axe: 1,0\r<br />\r<br />*Note: \r<br />The item names for Soulgems and Tools are edited for easier access. These names are used from the Better Item Sorting mod entries. http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14319\r<br />\r<br />Optional version: Slightly increased Dragon Bones/Scales to not break the immuhsion too hard. Includes every weight edit just like the main file, just an increased weight is added to dragon items. Do not install both.",
