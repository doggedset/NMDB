  "summary": "Full-screen coloured Categorized Favorites Menu config file. More specific categories for items to make things easier to find on the fly. Added a section for food to make compatible with Realistic Needs and Diseases by perseid9. Is compatible with a fair few mods, Dawnguard, and Dragonborn. *WIP*",
  "descriptionHtml": "[color=red][size=5]*WIP*[/size][/color]\r\nA note to say this is a work in progress. There are still likely more than a few items either in the wrong place or not categorised. If you come across an item where it doesn\\'t belong or in the Other menu please tell me and I\\'ll get about adding it properly.\r\n\r\nCurrently I\\'m updating this mod as bugs are pointed out and as I get requests. But if I end up getting a steady flow of these (which may or may not happen depending how popular this is and how many people comment) I\\'ll think about setting a regular date for an update with a mass of fixes rather than one at a time as it is now. \r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Description[/b][/size]\r\nThis is my own custom Config file for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4862/]Categorized Favorites Menu[/url]  mod by [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3562925/]favmenumodder[/url]. I\\'m very fussy when it comes to things like this, and found that none of the menu configs on the Nexus did what I would have liked them to do. So after a fair bit of trial and error I made my own.\r\n\r\nThis was designed to be a menu for most if not all character types, as I tend to play more than a few characters at one time. I tried to make the categories as detailed and as clear as I could without making it insanely over done. \r\n\r\nAll lists and their sub categories are shown  in the images above. Also a brief explanation of each list below: \r\n[b]Weapons:[/b]\r\nI\\'ve split all weapons into their types as identified by the game (the only exception being Tools). Mods that add additional weapon variations such as [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27644/]Immersive Weapons[/url] have been added to the original weapon types they were modelled after. An example being Quarterstaff\\'s, they will appear under the Warhammer category because that is what weapon the game recognises it as. \r\n\r\n[b]Attire:[/b]\r\nI would have liked to split amour and shields into Heavy and Light sections rather than Head, Body, Hands, Feet and Shields. But due to the Categorized Favorites Menu mod identifying items by their name and more than a few Items in game not identifying as heavy or light in their title, this wasn\\'t possible without a fair few conflicts. I\\'ve added Cloaks and Packs catering to the mods [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12092/]Cloaks of Skyrim[/url], [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13486/]Winter Is Coming - Cloaks[/url], and [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16438/]Bandolier - Bags and Pouches[/url] respectively as well. \r\n\r\n[b]Potions & Poisons:[/b]\r\nWith Potions I found that apart from the Health, Magicka, Stamina and poisons the rest of the potions were just thrown in a group together and I found that not only a bit unhelpful but it made me less inclined to favourite potions in the long run. So to better show a potions effects I added three additional potion categories. I added Resist for potions that gave the player a resistance to things like frost and fire. Skill effects for potions that increased the players skill and special effects for potions like invisibility, and waterbreathing. \r\n\r\n[b]Spells & Scrolls:[/b]\r\nThe magic list I didn\\'t change very much other than giving each class a category and extended the list length to have a full column, making it easier to have all your favourites spells on hand when you need them.\r\n\r\n[b]Abilities:[/b]\r\nWith the Abilities I naturally gave it a section for shouts, one for powers such as beast form and racial powers, one for survival skills to cater to mods like [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11163/]Frostfall - Hypothermia Camping Survival[/url] and [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26228/]Realistic Needs and Diseases[/url] and also a section for utilities, for mods that use powers to change and alter their settings like the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10012/]Unread Books Glow mod[/url].\r\n\r\n[b]Food & Beverages:[/b]\r\nI\\'m the type of person that loves immersion and use such mods to improve that. [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26228/]Realistic Needs and Diseases[/url] requires the player to eat and drink regularly, as such I found it a little bit annoying having to go into my inventory every time my character got hungry and having to search for an appropriate sized meal and beverage to suit their current needs. So I decided to make a list for it on the favourites menu. I\\'ve added categories for each meal type. Filling, Medium, and snack. Also including foods that are stale and raw more to make sure the player doesn\\'t accidentally eat something that might make them sick. \r\n\r\n[b]Other:[/b]\r\nI kept the Other menu to catch all the stray items that I might have missed in the initial creation of this Config. So if an Item isn\\'t appearing where it should it\\'s likely in this category. I aim to keep as many items out of this category as I can, but given the amount of items in game it\\'s rather a big task to take up on my own. As such I felt I\\'d upload it as is and if there is anything out of place I missed but you find please leave a comment to let me know.\r\n\r\n[size=5]Removed[/size]\r\nI have removed the Hotkey and Equip set lists that were on the original menu. Hot-keyed items will still show up in their categories with their hot-keyed number beside them as shown in the second screenshot. But I have removed Equip sets all together to make room for the other lists. \r\n\r\n[size=5]Planned[/size]\r\nI plan to add more Config files to cater to other screen sizes in the future. And maybe if I have the patience for it different categories (but as of right now the lists and categories are staying as are. You are more than welcome to configure this file as much as you like.) I\\'d also like to completely cover all the mods I have listed below properly and hopefully add more once that is done.\r\n\r\n[size=5]Installing & Uninstalling [/size]\r\nNow before installing this I suggest you backup the file it will be replacing. It won\\'t break your game or be the end of the world if you don\\'t. But if you do want to revert back to the original favoritesmenu.cfg from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4862/]Categorized Favorites Menu[/url] it is easier to have the file backed up rather than have to re install the mod.\r\n\r\n[b]With NMM[/b]\r\nI\\'m sure you all know how to do that by now.\r\n\r\n[b]Manual[/b]\r\n1- Unzip the file.\r\n2 - In that file there will be the folders as follows: Data\\\\Interface\\\\ \r\n3 - Either drag and drop the Data folder (and all files within) into your skyrim folder, usually located here: C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim or you can just copy the favoritesmenu.cfg file directly to C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Interface\r\n\r\nTo uninstall the this just replace the favoritesmenu.cfg with the one from the original [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4862/]Categorized Favorites Menu[/url] mod or reinstall Categorized Favorites Menu.\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Requirements[/b][/size]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4862/]Categorized Favorites Menu[/url] by [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3562925/]favmenumodder[/url]\r\nAnd Skyrim obviously.\r\n\r\n[size=5][b] Compatibility[/b][/size]\r\nThis mod is compatible with Dawnguard and Dragonborn but they are not required to use it.\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12092/]Cloaks of Skyrim[/url] \r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13486/]Winter Is Coming - Cloaks[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16438/]Bandolier - Bags and Pouches[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11163/]Frostfall - Hypothermia Camping Survival[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286/]T3nd0s Skyrim Redone[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26228/]Realistic Needs and Diseases[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10277/]Omegared99 - Armor Compilation[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27644/]Immersive Weapons[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19733/]Immersive Armors[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24941/]Dragonbone Ebonsteel Armor[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28287/]Dragon Knight Armor[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13133/]Dwemer Goggles and Scouter[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14950/]Convenient Horses[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26329/]Automatic Crossbows[/url]\r\n[b]0.1b[/b]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30918/]Colovian Leather[/url]\r\n[b]0.1c[/b]\r\nAdded an additional config for compatibility with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32145]Another Sorting Mod[/url] \r\n\r\nThe above are mods I personally have installed and have been included when I created this file. It also lists mods i\\'ve included in updates. For a full list of mods I know are (most of not fully) compatible without further change see the [b]READ ME[/b]\r\n\r\nThis Config in theory should be compatible with most armour and weapon mods to an Extent. The exceptions would be when weapons and amour don\\'t have things like \\'Armor\\' or \\'sword\\' in the title for the menu to use to categorize them. It is rather easy to add stray items to the menu yourself. But if there is an armor or weapon set you wish for me to add to the config just let me know and I\\'ll do my best to see it done as soon as I can.\r\n\r\nMods that add unique items ([url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13133/]Dwemer Goggles and Scouter[/url] for example) or powers ([url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26228/]Realistic Needs and Diseases[/url]) however is another story. Such things in the mods listed above are likely organised correctly with this menu, but as this is a WIP it is not guaranteed.\r\n\r\n[size=5][b] Which Main File to choose[/b][/size]\r\n[color=red][b]Choose one[/b][/color]\r\nCurrently I have more than one main file uploaded. This is mainly to cater to other screen resolutions and mods that I feel should have a Config of their own (to try and minimize possible conflicts and what not.) Now apart from any specific resolutions or mods in their description. They are the same provided they have the same version number. I will try to keep them all up to date to the current version.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any and all feedback you have to give for this Config so please don\\'t be shy but also be polite. \r\n\r\nIt\\'s a thing and it does stuff for things the end.",
