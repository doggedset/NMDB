  "descriptionHtml": "You are tired of many pseudo-realistic FXAA Post Project Injector settings? You cannot stand over-sharpening look like in Borderlands or over-saturating wich changes cold Skyrim into Happyland? NO MOAR! My settings are really balanced and these keeps cold Skyrim atmosphere.. or even better - it makes Skyrim colder than before! but I can guarantee that it don\\'t ruin your gaming experience.\r\n\r\nWhy I created these settings? Because I was upset of unbalanced settings of other users, I couldn\\'t choose perfect settings for me, so I decided to do this myself, and here you go!\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n1. Firstly you have to have installed original FXAA Post Project Injector by Retspadez, here\\'s link: http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=131\r\n2. Now you have to download my settings and simply put the \\'injFX_Settings.h\\' file in the archieve to the main Skyrim folder, D:/Program Files/Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim by default.\r\n3. Run Skyrim and play!\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\nReplace with another \\'injFX_Settings.h\\' or click \\'Uninstall.exe\\' in the main Skyrim folder from FXAA PPI.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nThanks to Retspadez for creating FXAA Post Project Injector\r\nThanks to Bethesda Softworks for creating such beautiful game like Skyrim.\r\n\r\nPS. Sorry if my english is bad, I\\'m from Poland. :)",
