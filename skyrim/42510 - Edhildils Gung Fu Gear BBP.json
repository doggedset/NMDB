  "descriptionHtml": "Edhildils Gung Fu Gear BBP\r\nAuthor: Edhildil\r\n09,18,2013\r\nver1\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT Really LORE FRIENDLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease read the whole description before you comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://img832.imageshack.us/img832/1236/descriptionn.png[/img]\r\n\r\nFor female only.\r\n\r\nI made this mod after trying \\\\\\\"Grandmaster - True Unarmed and Unarmored Combat\\\\\\\" by leecarter\r\n\r\nYou can find it here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13281\r\n\r\nThis mod is intended to be used with \\\\\\\"Grandmaster - True Unarmed and Unarmored Combat\\\\\\\", in which\r\nyour character gets bonuses/perks while unarmored and unarmed. it\\\\\\'s an awesome mod if you\\\\\\'re a martial arts fan.\r\nI wanted something that looked cool and had no armor rating but still had the Gung Fu feel.\r\n\r\nThere are two Gung Fu suits, one Worn and torn from battle and strife, and a non-worn, fresher suit.\r\nthere is an awesome set of classic Gung Fu shoes also. There is also a set of Katars or fist blades\r\nand all these items can be made at a forge. (Leather)\r\n\r\nThe suits are weighted for BBP. \r\n\r\nNOTE: The fist blades DO NO DAMAGE. Why? Because the Grandmaster mod is an UNARMED perk mod, and if they\r\nDID damage you would NOT receive the perks provided in the Grandmaster mod. I hope I made that clear enough.\r\n \r\nIf some wants to use my mesh and make a set of Katars that do damage go ahead just give me credit.\r\n\r\nI made one custom body size, that\\\\\\'s my story and i\\\\\\'m sticking to it. If you want another size or weight sliders\r\nI don\\\\\\'t have time for that, but if someone wants to make that, just give me credit. It would be nice if it was \r\ndependant on this mod also so that my original work wasn\\\\\\'t lost in the dust of time, which is understandable.\r\nExceptions would be large mods like a huge store or dungeon/quest that included these clothes, but credits still apply. \r\n(That means I don\\\\\\'t want to be completely ripped off if someone just reposts ALL my content of this mod with some slight changes, that\\\\\\'s not cool)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/4153/requir.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nCalientes CBBE body mod installed and running in your game.(hand textures?) Or compatible textures.\r\n\r\n[img]http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/6344/suggesth.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\\\\\\\"Grandmaster - True Unarmed and Unarmored Combat\\\\\\\" by leecarter\r\n\r\nYou can find it here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13281\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n[img]http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/2482/installa.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nUnzip Data file to a temporary location \r\nCheck folder paths and make adjustments if needed\r\ncopy/paste into Skyrim folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/9233/uninstall.png[/img]\r\n\r\ndelete data/meshes/armor/edhildil/gungfu folder\r\ndelete data/textures/armor/edhildil/gungfu folder\r\ndelete EDhildilsGungFuGear esp. file in your Skyrim Data folder.\r\n\r\n[img]http://img90.imageshack.us/img90/8579/creditslo.png[/img]\r\n\r\nCaliente for CBBE\r\nCherryhotaling for BBP\r\nEdhildil (these new meshes and textures)\r\n\r\nA big thanks to leecarter for the Grandmaster mod which inspired this mod.\r\n\r\n\r\nTools used:\r\n=======\r\nBlender\r\nNifscope\r\nGimp 2\r\n\r\nThanks to all above and to Skyrim Nexus.\r\n\r\n[img]http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/4562/usaget.png[/img]\r\n\r\nIf you want to use my meshes/textures in your mod please give the proper credits listed in your mod readme/description.
