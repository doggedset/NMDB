  "modName": "-Almost- Unique War Axe - Agnis Hatchet",
  "summary": "This is my first published mod. It adds an almost unique War Axe into the game, which you have to craft at the Skyforge. It is a recolor of the Steel War Axe with a single symbol on it.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I have already made smaller mods, but just for fun or for sharing with my friends. This is the first one that I actually decided to publish.\r\nAs there are lots of useful unique weaponry: swords (Dawnbreaker), greatswords (Ebony Blade), daggers (Mehrunes\\' Razor), maces (Mace of Molag Bal), warhammers (Volendrung) and battleaxes (Rueful Axe)... why the hell no decent War Axe? \\'-\\'\r\nFor all you battlemages, axe-wielding spellswords and axe dual-wielders, I made a War Axe comparable to a Daedric Artifact!\r\nTo craft it, get the \\'Dwarven Smithing\\' OR \\'Advanced Armors\\' perk and go to the Skyforge. It will be in the \\\"Misc\\\" session.\r\n\r\nIts stats are as follows:\r\n15 base damage (same as Ebony/Daedric War Axes)\r\n18 weight (same as a Daedric War Axe)\r\n15 base Fire Damage enchantment\r\n10 base Absorb Health enchantment\r\n\r\nIts crafting recipe is as follows:\r\n1x Steel War Axe\r\n2x Steel Ingot\r\n4x Gold Ingot\r\n3x Leather Strips\r\n1x Daedra Heart\r\n5x Firesalts\r\n1x Black Soul Gem (Black)\r\n\r\nIt also requires 2 Gold Ingots to upgrade at a Grindstone. It\\'s recipe is large and hard to fill exactly because it is supposed to be as powerful as a Daedric Artifact such as the Mace of Molag Bal.\r\nIf I offended someone with the name \\\"Agni\\\" (for religious purposes), it was not intentional. Should you find it better, I can change the name. This name was chosen as Agni is for me the best representant of fire (AND \\'fire\\' in Sanskrit).\r\nSay what you think of it in the comments, thanks =)",
