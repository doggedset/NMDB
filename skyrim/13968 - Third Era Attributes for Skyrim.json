  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6]Third Era Attributes for Skyrim[/size]\r\nVersion 1.2 beta\r\n\r\n===============================\r\n\r\n[size=5]Change Log[/size]\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2 beta\r\n- You can now level up multiple times\r\n- Fixed a bug where the willpower enchantment would not work\r\n- Fixed a bug where increasing Luck was impossible\r\n- Fixed a bug where Alteration, Destruction and Restoration would not increase your Willpower\r\n- Fixed a bug where increasing Speed would not show the correct notification\r\n- Lowered overall attackspeed by 20%\r\n- Dual Flurry perk doesn\\'t increase attackspeed to insane amounts\r\n- optional Third Era Attributes for Skyrim - Perks.esp file: Lowered running speed with weapon drawn\r\n- optional Third Era Attributes for Skyrim - Races.esp: Added a taunt perk under Speechcraft. You can now taunt NPCs into attacking you when your weapon is drawn!\r\n- Source codes are now included by default. Feel free to change them to your liking or upload your changes (just remember to give credits).\r\nVersion 1.1 beta\r\n- Changed Health, Magicka and Stamina regeneration effects\r\n- Fixed increased loot chance from Luck\r\n- You will not have to run the tutorial any longer for the mod to work. The optional compatability *.esp for Live Another Life is obsolete.\r\n- Unknown races will start with 20 points in every attribute\r\n- All texts (except enchantment / magic effect descriptions) have been moved to message forms for easier translation\r\n- Changed Treasure Hunter, Bladesman, Deep Wounds and Dual Flurry perks so they don\\'t conflict with attributes\r\n- Fixed race descriptions in the optional Third Era Attributes for Skyrim - Races.esp\r\n\r\n===============================\r\n\r\n[size=5]Description[/size]\r\n\r\nTEAS adds Strength, Endurance, Intelligence, Willpower, Agility, Speed, Personality and Luck for the player character to Skyrim.\r\n\r\n===============================\r\n\r\n[size=5]How does it work?[/size]\r\n\r\nYou level up like normally, but when picking Health, Magicka or Stamina, they won\\'t increase. When you exit the menu, you are prompted with a new window where you can pick three attributes to increase.\r\nTo view your attributes, you have a power called \\\"Show Attributes\\\", which you can find in your magic menu.\r\n\r\nEvery time you increase a skill, a counter for its governing attribute is increased by 1. Once you level up, the attribute with the highest counter can be increased by 3, attributes with a counter greater than 0 by 2. Any other attribute can be increased by 1 point.\r\n\r\nTo compensate for the lack of skills with Speed as their governing attribute, sprinting will increase your \\\"Athletics skill\\\". If you sprint long enough and increase this variable, you will be able to increase Speed a bit more when leveling up.\r\n\r\nAll races have different starting attributes. They are the same ones from Morrowind and Oblivion, except 20 points less in every attribute to compensate the higher maximum level in Skyirm.\r\nFor example, where Nord had 50 Strength in Oblivion, they now have 30.\r\n\r\nYou can also find enchanted rings that fortify one of your attributes.\r\n\r\nFurther, with the introduction of Speed, TEAS also adds a dodge ability to Skyrim. When you dodge successfully, time slows down and gives you the chance to evade incoming attacks.\r\nYour chance to dodge is decreased when you wear a cuirass (only 10% of original value), but can be increased for light armor users by increasing the Light Armor skill (+0.3% per skill level).\r\n\r\n===============================\r\n\r\n[size=5]Compatability[/size]\r\n\r\nTEAS makes use of unused Actor Values. Thus, it will conflict with any mod that makes changes of the following values:\r\n\r\nFavorActive (Strength)\r\nFavorsPerDay (Endurance)\r\nFavorsPerDayTimer (Intelligence)\r\nIgnoreCrippledLimbs (Willpower)\r\nLastBribedetimidated (Agility)\r\nLastFlattered (Speed)\r\nFame (Personality)\r\nInfamy (Luck)\r\n\r\n===============================\r\n\r\n[size=5]Installation[/size]\r\n\r\nCopy the Third Era Attributes for Skyrim.esp (and optional *.esps you\\'d like to use) and the Scripts folder into your Data folder, and select the esp in the Data Files menu in the Skyrim launcher.\r\n\r\nIf you have an older version of TEAS installed and run into any problems, you might have to make a clean save game. Remove all related files from your Data folder, load your game and make a new save. Afterwards, install the new TEAS version\r\nHowever, this will reset your attributes to starting values, and you will have to readjust them using the console.\r\n\r\n[color=#ff0000]In any case, always back up your save games before installing a new version![/color]\r\n\r\n===============================\r\n\r\n[size=5]Attribute effects[/size]\r\n\r\nStrength[list]\r\n[*]Increases maximum Stamina (+1 per Strength)\r\n[*]Increases Carry Weight (200 + Strength * 5)\r\n[*]Increases damage with fists, one-handed and two-handed weapons (1% per Strength)\r\n[*]Governs: One-Handed and Two-Handed\r\n[/list]\r\nEndurance[list]\r\n[*]Increases maximum Health (Endurance *5)\r\n[*]Increases maximum Stamina (+1 per Endurance)\r\n[*]Increases Health Regeneration (Endurance * 4)\r\n[*]Increases Stamina Regeneration (Endurance * 0.25)\r\n[*]Increases blocked damage (1% per Endurance)\r\n[*]Increases health recovered from potions and spells (0.5% per Endurance)\r\n[*]Governs: Block, Heavy Armor, Smithing\r\n[/list]\r\nIntelligence[list]\r\n[*]Increases maximum Magicka (Intelligence * 5)\r\n[*]Lowers spell cost (-1% per Intelligence (capped at -90%))\r\n[*]Lowers charge cost of enchanted weapons and staves (-1% per Intelligence (capped at -90%))\r\n[*]Increases leveling speed (1% per Intelligence)\r\n[*]Increases strength of potions (1% per Intelligence)\r\n[*]Increases strength of enchantments (1% per Intelligence)\r\n[*]Governs: Alchemy, Enchanting, Conjuration\r\n[/list]\r\nWillpower[list]\r\n[*]Increases maximum Stamina (+1 per Willpower)\r\n[*]Increases Magicka Regeneration (Willpower * 0.25)\r\n[*]Increases Magic Resist (Willpower * 0.5)\r\n[*]Increases Power Attack Damage (+1% per Willpower)\r\n[*]Increases Critical Damage (+1% per Willpower)\r\n[*]Governs: Alteration, Destruction, Restoration\r\n[/list]\r\nAgility[list]\r\n[*]Increases maximum Stamina (+1 per Agility)\r\n[*]Increases Critical Hit chance (Agility * 0.25)\r\n[*]Increases lockpick chance (+1% per Agility)\r\n[*]Increases pickpocket chance (+1% per Agility)\r\n[*]Increases damage with bows (+1% per Agility)\r\n[*]Lowers detection chance while sneaking (-0.5% per Agility)\r\n[*]Governs: Archery, Lockpicking, Pickpocket, Sneak\r\n[/list]\r\nSpeed[list]\r\n[*]Increases running speed (+1 per Speed)\r\n[*]Increases attack speed with weapons (+0.5% per Speed)\r\n[*]Increases dodge chance (Speed * 0.8)\r\n[*]Governs: Light Armor and Sprinting\r\n[/list]\r\nPersonality[list]\r\n[*]Influences buying and selling prices (0.4% per Personality)\r\n[*]Increases persuasion and intimidation chance (1% per Personality)\r\n[*]Governs: Illusion and Speech\r\n[/list]\r\nLuck[list]\r\n[*]Special Loot Chance (+0.25% per Luck)\r\n[*]A bit of everything\r\n[/list]\r\n===============================\r\n\r\n[size=5]Optional Files[/size]\r\n\r\nTEAS contains three optional *.esp files.\r\n\r\n===============================\r\n\r\n[size=5]Third Era Attributes for Skyrim - Perks.esp[/size]\r\n\r\n[color=#ff0000]WARNING: Before using this mod, unequip all enchanted items, and let all potion effects expire!
