  "modName": "Segmented Armor Perks Re-Mastered",
  "summary": "Instead of Perks applying only to wearing a full set, they now apply for each piece of armor worn.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod separates most armor perks to give smaller bonuses for each piece of armor you wear (Which fits it\\'s requirements)\r\n\r\nExamples are:\r\n\r\nCushioned: Has been changed to give smaller reductions to fall damage, but for each piece of heavy armor worn. Light Armor can be worn as well without forfeiting it\\'s full bonuses.\r\n\r\nWind Walker: It\\'s the same as above, except it\\'s for Stamina Regeneration. Heavy Armor can still be worn without forfeiting the whole bonus.\r\n\r\nWell Fitted has been changed to give smaller bonuses to Armor, as long as no Light Armor is worn. Wearing a single piece won\\'t do anything, however when you wear 2 or more pieces, armor rating will scale up.\r\n\r\nSame thing for Custom Fit.\r\n\r\nMatched Set perks now factor in whether or not you have a helm equipped. If you don\\'t have a helm equipped, you still get 20% of the bonus, but not the whole thing. (These perks also work alongside the \\'Fit\\' perks, so it\\'ll scale up heaps once you wear 3 pieces of armor)\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the mod, and if you\\'ve got any recommendations for future mods (Especially with Perks) you can either leave a comment or send me a message. I\\'ll definitely try my best to bring your idea to life.\r\n\r\nAny questions can be addressed in the comments section, enjoy the mod!",
