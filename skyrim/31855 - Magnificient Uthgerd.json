  "descriptionHtml": "I see a ton of overhauls for the somewhat already good looking followers like Jordis, Lydia etc. ,\r\nbut i was having a hard time finding replacements for the \\\\\\\"second hand\\\\\\\" followers, so I decided to make my own changes. The result looks surprisingly good and I thought i might share it. The Skyrim NPC Editor is so fun and easy to use.I am using the UNP body but I reckon it doesn\\\\\\'t affect the face anyway. The face mods i have installed are:\r\nBella\\\\\\'s Better Females with Makeup Version 1 and No Shine extra patches\r\nCowerwomen look 3\r\nTS Femafe Face Tattoos volume 6\r\nApachiHair latest version\r\n\r\nP.S I might have some mods for other parts of the face like lips, eyes etc. but i don\\\\\\'t have NMM installed and i can\\\\\\'t keep track of what mods i\\\\\\'ve downloaded, so if your Uthgerd doesn\\\\\\'t look like the one in the screenshot , chances are i have additional textures that i don\\\\\\'t remember, but they should all be available in the skyrim nexus.",
