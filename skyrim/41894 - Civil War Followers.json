I mean, what\\'s the point of progressing in an ethically questionable fantasy military hierarchy if you don\\'t get to order your mook subordinates into heroic battles for which they are vastly underqualified?\r\n\r\nThis applies to any of the soldiers you can find at military camps or forts occupied by your faction, as well as those found on patrols and at sieges. City guards are exempt. They don\\'t have time to look for your sweetrolls.\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=#f5aa44]FAQ[/color][/size]\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Are the soldiers voiced?\r\n[/list]\r\nYup; it uses a few repurposed vanilla lines. They may sound slightly overexcited!\r\n\r\n[size=5][color=#f5aa44]Compatibility[/color][/size]\r\n\r\nThe system is completely separate, so it shouldn\\'t affect either vanilla followers or mods that change vanilla follower behavior. If you have changes to civil war NPCs in general, it may potentially have difficulty recognizing new soldier types; they must be members of CWDialogueSoldierFaction.",
