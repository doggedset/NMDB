  "descriptionHtml": "-ARMIES OF SKYRIM-\r\nWIP\r\n\r\nThings to come\r\n\r\nEver walked through skyrim wishing you could get an army to go around beating up the imperials, Stormcloaks, Civilians, Humans or any other rascist whim of yours. well soon you can. . . . \r\n\r\nThis mod will add large scale follower armies, but for now there is only Stormcloaks, They are now outside the sleeping giants inn, there are 20 full combat Stormcloaks and a comander, by talking to the comander you can have the stormcloak army follow you, they though of course keep there factions, hence making them more realistic, by attacking imperials on sight. \r\n\r\nContents\r\nStormcloak army (20 + 1 commander)\r\nFollow, wait and return options\r\n\r\nArmies to come:\r\nImperials\r\nBandits\r\nFalmer\r\nForsworn\r\nVampires\r\nWerewolves\r\nNecromancers\r\nSuggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\nyour allowed to bring followers too, but if there factioned against the army, they WILL kill them\r\n\r\nSimple enough mod, thought it might spice up the game",
