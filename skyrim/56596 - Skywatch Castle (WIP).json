  "summary": "This mod adds a new keep just  west of Shor&#39;s Stone.  It is currently in pre alpha stage and I will be updating it frequently in the future.  It&#39;s my first mod so just leave reports of any bugs and criticism in the comment topic.  ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Skywatch Castle is a new castle just west of Shor&#39;s Stone.  It is quite secluded in the mountains as to not ruin the environment with a huge fortress and I have used the Palace of the Kings Windhelm castle style instead of the overused fort Dawnguard look.  It currently consists of a library, main hallway and a tower interior.  A book with more backstory information can be found within Riften along with a key to the Castle.  It is in major development and the mod doesn&#39;t add much to the game at the moment.  ",
