  "descriptionHtml": "This is really just a personal mod I made for myself, but I thought I&#39;d share it in case anyone else wanted to use it. I have changed all of Miraak&#39;s clothes (robes, mask, boots and gloves) to be light armor, and additionally added the enchantment that was on Konahrik&#39;s mask to also be on Miraak&#39;s mask. The reasoning is, I really liked Miraak&#39;s armor, but no other dragon priest masks went as well with the set as Miraak does, but I really like the enchantment on Konahrik, so I put it on Miraak (the mask) so that I could wear the complete set with that enchantment. :)",
