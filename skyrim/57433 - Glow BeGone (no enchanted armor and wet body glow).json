  "modName": "Glow BeGone (no enchanted armor and wet body glow)",
  "summary": "Remove glow from your enchanted armor and jewelry. Now with no glow for Frostfall wet effect.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Good news for all [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11163]Frostfall[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27563]Wet&Cold[/url] users, who like dripping effect, but hate how body glows while your character is wet. New version removes body glow, while keeps dripping effect intact.\r<br />\r<br />Hate how your enchanted armor glow? Hate to see how ugly it looks when you rest inside of your tent (Frostfall users will understand what I mean)?\r<br />Want a cure for this abomination, but can&#39;t find any? Seek no further as you just found one.\r<br />\r<br />SCRIPTS-FREE and fully modular. Have 3 modules (Main, Frostfall and Wet&Cold). Does not change any armor or enchantments so must be compatible with everything, except those mods that touch same shader effects.\r<br /> But if you use any of such mods then you obviously don&#39;t need this. What are you saying? You still need this? Then load it after any of such mods and everything will be just fine.\r<br />\r<br />Q - How to use this?\r<br />A - Download. Install. Enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />Q - How it works?\r<br />A - Do you care? Oh you do? Ok then. It kills in-game shader effects used to produce this ugly glow. And don&#39;t worry. Those effects used for this glow only.\r<br />\r<br />Almost forgot. It removes sound from enchanted armor as well.\r<br />And don&#39;t worry, no incompatibilities with any sound mod.\r<br />\r<br />Please mind, that this doesn&#39;t remove glow from any of the active spell effects. For this purpose you need [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34981]No More Glowing Edges[/url]. This only removes glow that you can see on your enchanted armor while it&#39;s unequipped (lies on the ground or somewhere else) or in your inventory. Again Frostfall users will understand what I mean and why I prefer to not have this glow. If you don&#39;t care how it looks in your inventory or on the ground, then you probably don&#39;t need this.",
