  "descriptionHtml": "[b]REQUIRES IMMERSIVE ARMORS and AMIDIANBORN TEXTURES FOR IMMERSIVE ARMORS.\r<br />\r<br />1.1 - Reuploaded file[/b]. Requires [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29167/?]original mod textures by Merilia[/url] . The cuirass is still the same textures and is not included, just the fixed files for the inner nord plate shoulderpads that originally had standard amidianborn textures, now darkened to fit the armor. Helmet, boots and bracers included.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Description:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />This file replaces and darkens the textures given by Merilia (get the mod [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29167/?]HERE[/url]) from the amidianBorn/CaBaL originals made for the Heroic Imperial Armor set from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19733/?]Immersive Armors[/url]. Originally, that texture set replaced the cuirass and shoulderpads, but the contrast was very ugly, as the bracers, boots and helmet were still pretty white/silver. This fixes that, giving the set an unique, more serious and friendly look (see screenshots, the helmet top IS dark red, though with my actual visual settings it isn&#39;t very clear).\r<br />\r<br />Extract them to your data folder.\r<br />\r<br />Hopefully I&#39;ll be adding more retextures for Immersive Armors. Coming next will be the Clansman&#39;s helm and the Chainmail Jerkin. They really could use some retexturing.\r<br />\r<br />[b]All credits and thanks to:\r<br />\r<br />[/b]hothtrooper and every author who contributed to the compilation.\r<br />Merilia for applying proper textures for the mod.\r<br />AmidianBorn/CaBaL for their impressive work.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Other fixes by  ▬ [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4655485/?tb=mods&pUp=1]Villacardo[/url] [/b]",
