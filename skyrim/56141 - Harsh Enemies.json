  "descriptionHtml": "Harsh Enemies mod is somewhat extension to Harsh Nature mod, but independent. \r<br />Requirements: official DLCs Dragonborn and Dawnguard. \r<br />\r<br />What this does is makes many enemies from DLCs much tougher. For example death hounds inflict more damage and as new feature they absorb players magic. So do Seekers amongst many tweaks in enemies damages. \r<br />\r<br />Overall Solstheim, Soul Cairn and Apocrypha are now much more challenging places to visit. \r<br />\r<br />Reason for this mod is that I thought enemies from DLCs didn&#39;t give any challenge.\r<br />\r<br />What&#39;s changed?\r<br />- mostly damages enemies can inflict (often doubled), in some cases magicka and stamina also\r<br />- added new abilities to enemies\r<br />\r<br />Generally it&#39;s not good idea to make enemies strong by editing their health, instead tweaked them to make more damage.\r<br />",
