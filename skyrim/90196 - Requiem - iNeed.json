  "descriptionHtml": "A balance patch for iNeed v1.602 and Requiem 2.0.1. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Thank you isoku for iNeed! Get it here: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51473/?\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Removes the buffs that iNeed gives when the player satisfies hunger/thirst (they still show in active effects):\n<br /> - Well Sated (health regeneration and damage output increased by 5%)\n<br /> - Well Hydrated (5% shout cooldown reduction, stamina and magicka regeneration increased by 5%)\n<br /> - Vaired Diet (+10 health)\n<br /> \n<br />Balances iNeed's feature of letting the player eat cheese wheels in portions:\n<br /> - Made the stats of different portions consistent\n<br /> - 8 portions total: wheel -&gt; sliced wheel -&gt; wedges\n<br />\n<br />Also includes FISS support so you can save/load MCM settings.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Notes:\n<br />Not compatible with the new SSE iNeed. Only version 1.602.\n<br />Modifies two scripts, sources included.\n<br />I've only added Bottled Water to iNeed's inbuilt lists. More could be added, but iNeed's recognition system is already quite nice.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Load order:\n<br />iNeed.esp\n<br />Requiem.esp\n<br />Requiem - iNeed.esp",
