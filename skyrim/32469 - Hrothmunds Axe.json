  "summary": "Adds an equipable version of Hrothmund\\'s Axe to Hrothmund\\'s Burrow.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod, so bear with me. Feel free to report bugs, if there are any, but understand I probably know as much as you about how to fix it.\r\n\r\nPut simply, this mod replaces the static version of Hrothmund\\'s Axe in Hrothmund\\'s Burrow with one you can pick up and equip. The stats are similar to an Ebony battleaxe. \r\n\r\nIn future updates I\\'d like to expand on the \\'Retaking Thirsk\\' quest. It feels very unfinished, and looking at it in the Creation Kit, it seems like Bethesda had intended to add a bit more to it. Besides, why would they build such a beautiful weapon, then leave it in a rock?\r\n\r\n[u]Installation[/u]\r\nFor you smart folk, just click the \\'Download with Manager\\' button. For you sillies who don\\'t use the NMM, simply download the file, unzip it, and drag it into your Data folder.",
