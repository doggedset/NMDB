So I decided to do it myself. Very simple mod.\r<br />\r<br />Makes you about the height of an average person. Should work with Male and Female forms. Haven&#39;t tested female myself.\r<br /> \r<br />Shouldn&#39;t be incompatible with any mods that affect Vampire Lords, just tell me if there&#39;s any issues with it.",
