  "summary": "My attempt to give Shadowmere true dark and still realistic appearance. Cuz vanilla looked like Whiterun horse, and was boring brown",
  "descriptionHtml": "First of all : I discovered that Shadowmere has his own model, but developers didn\\'t bothered themselves to give him an unique texture. \r\nSecond : I always wondered why did they give him that ugly red gloss on his fur so I edited a model a bit to give Shadowmere nice silver shining. It isn\\'t bright and too noticeable.\r\nThird : I didn\\'t want to give him some mad colors, so I tried to make him look realistic.\r\n\r\nSo there we go ! Rate and comment, If you like It... Or not, It you don\\'t)",
