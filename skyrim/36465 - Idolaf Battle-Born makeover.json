  "descriptionHtml": "Just another NPC that I\\'ve touched up to look slightly better.  No drastic changes, and nothing that should cause grey-face bugs in your game.\r\nAs my other NPC makeover mods, this does NOT make him a follower in your game.\r\n\r\n--Installation--\r\nDownload my main file, extract the files into your /Skyrim/Data folder, activate \\\"IdolafBattleBorn.esp\\\" in your data files, run game.\r\n\r\n--Bugs/known issues--\r\nI have a work around/fix if you encounter a neck seam:\r\nBring up the console with \\\" ~ \\\" button, target Idolaf, type setnpcweight 70, type disable, type enable. Should fix him from here on.\r\n\r\nIf you have any issues PLEASE let me know and I\\'ll see what I can come up with for you.\r\n\r\nAdd Pics if you enjoy using my mod!  And don\\'t forget to endorse me :)\r\n\r\n--Mods Highly Recommended--\r\nIf you have not yet begun to use it, I highly recommend you get Better males - Beautiful nudes and faces - New hairstyles by Chris57 and FavoredSoul found here:  \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488/\r\nAlso I use a customized version of RealLike ENB by s3b3k87 found here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22056/\r\n\r\nUPDATE!!
