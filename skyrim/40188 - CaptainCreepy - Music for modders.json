  "descriptionHtml": "06/12 - Want these musics in your game ? Check out the amazing Fantasy Soundtrack project : http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/46518\r<br />It&#39;s a very cool and awesome compilation. Thanks to AceeQ on that one ;)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Music for modders\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Description : \r<br />This is a pack of lore friendly music. By lore friendly music I mean :\r<br />- No inappropriate instruments, only strings, winds, brass and choirs with high level realism\r<br />- Appropriate orchestration : I tried to be close to Jeremy Soule&#39;s soundtrack\r<br />\r<br />The pack is mainly aimed at modders that want unique music for their mods ( I take requests as well, PM me ).\r<br />As provided, the musics are in 16 or 24bits WAV format, so you&#39;ll have to convert them to xwm ( Skyrim Audio Converter can do that ).\r<br />If you are experienced with modding, and just want these music in your game, you can use Personalized Music, but I will not provide any support for that.\r<br />\r<br />Music list (+ previews ) :\r<br />\r<br />=&gt; Skt_amb3 : This is a simple piece, with harp and soft strings/winds, mixing both Morrowind and Skyrim themes, plus some of my own melodies. https://soundcloud.com/creepyskyrim/faal-feykro\r<br />\r<br />=&gt; Skt_amb4 : Soft choirs/strings/bells track. Would fit in a night scene. \r<br />\r<br />=&gt; Skt_amb5 : an harp cover of Peaceful Waters from Morrowind ( I believe you can hear it in the \r<br />Dragonborn DLC too ). Very ambiant. https://soundcloud.com/creepyskyrim/fen-kos-drem\r<br />\r<br />=&gt;Skt_amb6 : Soft choirs and strings, some winds too. Very atmospheric. https://soundcloud.com/creepyskyrim/a-night-in-hjaalmarch\r<br />\r<br />=&gt;Skt_amb7 : Bass/tenor choirs. Also very ambiant/atmospheric, really Skyrim-ish. https://soundcloud.com/creepyskyrim/dark-mountains\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />=&gt;Skt_castle1 : Fitting music for a Jarl&#39;s palace. https://soundcloud.com/creepyskyrim/longue-vie-au-jarl\r<br />\r<br />=&gt;Skt_CivilWar : Fight for your city. Or against it. Hard Orchestra, loud percussion. You may want to reduce the volume on that one before putting it into the game. https://soundcloud.com/creepyskyrim/zin-ahrk-dwiin\r<br />\r<br />=&gt;Skt_town3 : Peaceful town. Pizzicato cellos.\r<br />\r<br />Bonus : warning, these are less lore friendly. These are based on the hobbit theme ( could still fit Skyrim thought )\r<br />Second warning, youtube preview&#39;s audio quality is crap.\r<br />\r<br />Hobbit : A main theme. Epic. \r<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFL_Xt4MmbU\r<br />\r<br />Hobbit_misty sovngard : Sovngard-ish. Enjoy. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V5Xd5BeFkY\r<br />\r<br />Hobbit intro : soft version of the main theme http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvfO-D38xoc\r<br />\r<br />I COMPOSED, PRODUCED AND MIXED ALL THESE MUSICS.
