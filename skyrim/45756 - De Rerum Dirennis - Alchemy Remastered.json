  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://static1.nexusmods.com/110/mods/110/images/45756-3-1382944711.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nNOTE: As stated in the brief, this mod is very aimed towards thos who heavily rely on alchemy. That is not to say those who just like to dabble in alchemy will not benefit from this mod also, however the target audience is aimed at hardcore alchemists. \r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS IT?: \r\n\r\nThis mod is a complete reworking of the alchemy tree primarily, with a few extra much needed features as a bonus. It was designed to stay true to vanilla skyrim as possible whilst providing a more comprehensive alchemy experience. \r\n\r\n- The perk tree is now split into three sections, potion, poison and assistance. \r\n\r\n- All perks in the new perk tree are altered vesions of the vanilla perks, however most have been greatly enhanced and now have multiple ranks. \r\n\r\n- There is one new perk called extra vials, which increases your carrying capacity by 100 when carrying potions or poisons. \r\n\r\n- All the perks have been rearranged to give a more logical and more flexible progression through the tree. \r\n\r\n- The perk level requirements have been altered to allow for the early flexability and continuous progression not seen in the vanilla tree. \r\n\r\n- Every perk change can bee seen listed below, the pictures give information on where each perk is in the tree. \r\n\r\n- The tree is significantly better visually, now resembling a potion vial. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERK CHANGES: \r\n\r\nALCHEMIST: Now has TEN ranks. \r\n\r\nRank 1: Crafted potions and poisons are 20% more effective. \r\n\r\nRank 2: Crafted potions and poisons are 40% more effective. - Lvl 20 needed. \r\n\r\nRank 3: Crafted potions and poisons are 60% more effective. - Lvl 30 needed. \r\n\r\nRank 4: Crafted potions and poisons are 80% more effective. - Lvl 40 needed. \r\n\r\nRank 5: Crafted potions and poisons are 100% more effective. - Lvl 50 needed. \r\n\r\nRank 6: Crafted potions and poisons are 120% more effective. - Lvl 60 needed. \r\n\r\nRank 7: Crafted potions and poisons are 140% more effective. - Lvl 70 needed. \r\n\r\nRank 8: Crafted potions and poisons are 160% more effective. - Lvl 80 needed. \r\n\r\nRank 9: Crafted potions and poisons are 180% more effective. - Lvl 90 needed. \r\n\r\nRank 10: Crafted potions and poisons are three times more effective. - Lvl 100 needed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN: Now has TWO ranks. Power increased. \r\n\r\nRank 1: Potions you mix that restore Health, Magicka or Stamina are 50% more powerful. - Lvl 20 needed. \r\n\r\nRank 2: Potions you mix that restore Health, Magicka or Stamina are twice as powerful. - Lvl 40 needed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISONER: Now has TWO ranks. Power increased. \r\n\r\nRank 1: Poison effectiveness is increased by 50% - Lvl 30 needed. \r\n\r\nRank 2: Poison effectiveness is increased by 100% - Lvl 60 needed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBENEFACTOR: Now has TWO ranks. Power increased. \r\n\r\nRank 1: Helpful potion\\'s effectiveness is increased by 50% - Lvl 30 needed. \r\n\r\nRank 2: Helpful potion\\'s effectiveness is increased by 100% - Lvl 60 needed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCENTRATED POISON: Now has EIGHT ranks. \r\n\r\nRank 1: Poisons last for 2 hits. - Lvl 40 needed. \r\n\r\nRank 2: Poisons last for 4 hits. - Lvl 50 needed. \r\n\r\nRank 3: Poisons last for 8 hits. - Lvl 60 needed. \r\n\r\nRank 4: Poisons last for 12 hits. - Lvl 70 needed. \r\n\r\nRank 5: Poisons last for 16 hits. - Lvl 80 needed. \r\n\r\nRank 6: Poisons last for 20 hits. - Lvl 90 needed. \r\n\r\nRank 7: Poisons last for two dozen hits. - Lvl 100 needed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSNAKEBLOOD: Power increased. \r\n\r\nPoison resistance increased to 100% (from 50%). - Lvl 50 needed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN THUMB: Now has TWO ranks. \r\n\r\nRank 1: Two ingredients can be harvested from each plant. - Lvl 40 needed. \r\n\r\nRank 2: Three ingredients can be harvested from each plant. - Lvl 80 needed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRA VIALS: New perk. \r\n\r\nCarrying capacity increases by 100 when carrying potions or poisons. - Lvl 40 needed. \r\nUPDATE: The \\'carrying potions\\' requirement was removed due to the addition of the weightless crafted potions feature. \r\n\r\n\r\nPURITY: Unaltered. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT ELSE IT DOES: Bonus Features \r\n\r\n\r\nINGREDIENT WEIGHT \r\nIngredient weight is now 0 for all ingredients. This make everything far more convenient. This particular mod however only alters the vanilla ingredients. Dawnguard and Dragonborn add-ons for this mod are available in order to alter the ingredients added by the DLCs. \r\n\r\nFRENZY AND FEAR EFFECTS \r\nFrezy and Fear have been greatly empowered. In the vanilla game, with all the perks the maximum level enemy you could fear/frenzy with a poision (with no enchanted armour) was level 12. What a joke! its now 4x for all those ingredients so it is actually usable. Again, to achieve this with the DLC ingredients, the add-ons are needed. \r\n\r\nCRAFTED POTION WEIGHT NEW \r\nCrafted potions and poisons will now be weightless. This make carrying around a buttton of p&ps, like I always do when playing an alchemist, a whole lot easier. \r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES: \r\n\r\n- Any mod that changes the ingredients in any way will conflict. If you want to use the other mods effects place it after this mod in the load order (it will probbably mean they wont be weightless anymore though!). \r\n\r\n- Any mod that changes the alchemy perk tree will also conflict. \r\n\r\n- Any mod that changes the which ingredients are available form vendors/corpses/etc will NOT conflict. \r\n\r\n- Is this overpowered? Quite. \r\n\r\n-Make sure you give a thumbs up if you like it! :) \r\n\r\n-The vials on my armour are added by the Bandolier mod. I highly reccomend it! \r\n\r\n- The area I am in is Riverwood from \\'Towns and Villages Enhanced\\', I am sitting because I am using \\'Dovahkiin Relaxes Too\\'. All are great mods! \r\n\r\n- Blue mountian flower + Hanging Moss makes a very expensive poison. Good for becoming rich and for leveling up. \r\n\r\n- Adding Lavender to the above mix makes it even more expensive! All of these ingredients are common and cheap. \r\n\r\n\r\nHave fun :) ",
