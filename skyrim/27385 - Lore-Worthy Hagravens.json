  "descriptionHtml": "[quote]&#34;...vivid red light began to form in the palm of its talons, it was all I could do to raise my shield in defense of magic most foul. I fought through devilry that seemed to snatch life from me...&#34;\r<br />\r<br />-Herbane&#39;s Bestiary: Hagravens[/quote]\r<br />\r<br />While my first Hagraven encounter was a rather nasty surprise (too many Fireballs&#33;), the Hagraven has always somewhat disappointed me. Considering they are supposed to be powerful magic users, I always felt that their spell selection was too limited. This mod attempts to correct that while staying true to Skyrim&#39;s relatively &#34;low-magic&#34; style.\r<br />\r<br />Absorb Health and Frost Cloak were added to conform to the description of Hagravens in in-game lore (see quote above) and because they (IMO) fit with the necromancy-oriented nature of Hagravens. As of version 1.1 Hagravens also possess the ability to conjure ice wraiths.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />My other mods:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/42855/?]Lore-Worthy Bandits[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26450/?]Lore-Worthy Nettlebane[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30503/?]Lore-Worthy Movarths Boots[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36797/?]Lore-Worthy Quartermasters[/url]",
