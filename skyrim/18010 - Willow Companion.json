  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is a collective effort of DreamBurrow and Jacktthompson.  Hope you enjoy it!!\r\n\r\nWillow\\'s Story\r\n================\r\nWillow is half Bosmer and half Breton. She is a petite woman, and probably the shortest you\\'ve ever met. She\\'s a day dreamer and a wandering bard. You\\'ll find her performing her music in Whiterun. Pretty deadly with a bow. She\\'ll get knocked down but will not die.  She will level with your character.\r\n\r\nWillow\\'s Schedule\r\n=================\r\nShe can be found dancing terribly or playing her flute at the marketplace in the morning. You\\'ll find her wandering around Whiterun in the evening. She may also be found at the Banneredmare playing her lute and singing, especially at night. \r\n\r\nWillow\\'s Skills\r\n=================\r\nShe\\'s a ranger, a pretty decent one, with many perks. \r\nShe\\'s better with light armor, and good at one handed and archery. \r\n\r\nWillow\\'s Armor\r\n=================\r\nTo get Willow to wear the Dreamburrow Sage Outfit Retexture, open her inventory and take it and give it back to her.  When she first appears she will be in default clothes.  The only way I could keep her from appearing naked when you first meet her.\r\n\r\nMarrying Willow\r\n=================\r\nJust go to Riften, and walk into the Bee and Bard. \r\nA man named Maramal will be preaching. He\\'ll sell you an Amulet of Mara. Just put it on and talk to Willow. She\\'ll ask if you\\'re interested. \r\n\r\nOTHER MODS RECOMMENDED (to look like screenshots)\r\n=================\r\nSKYRIM ENHANCED SHADERS FX ENB:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=822\r\n\r\nPretty Female Idles\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11954\r\n\r\nBethesda HD DLC textures\r\n\r\nVarious landscape and object texture improvements in STEP - Skyrim Total Enhancement Project: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11\r\n\r\nINCOMPATIBILITIES\r\n=================\r\nNone that we know of.\r\n\r\nCAVEATS\r\n=================\r\nBody textures are hi-res...because they look the best :) May experience some fps drop.  My experience is a few fps at most, however there are a lot of different rigs out there so if anyone has a huge problem let me know.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n=================\r\nI use TesModManager and have not tried this with NMM.  You can use a mod manager or just copy the files to your Skyrim Data directory, overwriting when it asks you (after making a backup of course... ;) http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5010\r\n\r\nBOSS Load Order Sorting is highly recommended\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6\r\n\r\nBOSS will most likely not recognize Willow so make sure she is with any other followers/companions in your load order. She should be toward the end of your load order after custom weapons and armors but before things like Enhanced Character Edit or Extended Color sliders.\r\n\r\nUNINSTALL\r\n=================\r\nDismiss Willow, Clean save, Uninstall with your Mod Manager or delete the files from your data directory.\r\n\r\nTROUBLESHOOTING\r\n=================\r\n1. Make sure there is a folder called WillowBody in your Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\ folder.\r\n2. Make sure there is a dds file in Textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\FaceGenData\\\\FaceTint\\\\WillowFollower.esp folder\r\n3. Make sure WillowFollower is checked in your load order.\r\n4. Make sure you are outside of Whiterun before loading Willow. \r\n5. If you are having the Bethesda face discoloration bug try opening the console, select Willow with your mouse pointer and type setnpcweight 50 then close and reopen the console, select Willow again and type setnpcweight 10 to see if this fixes the issue.\r\n6. I found another Bethesda bug with leveling. If you cannot get Willow to level when your character goes up a level, try opening the console before recruiting her, selecting Willow with your mouse pointer, type \\\"disable\\\", close the console, reopen the console, select Willow again, then type \\\"enable\\\".\r\n\r\nCREDITS\r\n=================\r\nSkin and Body Texture Dimonized UNP by dimon99: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6709\r\n\r\nAdditional Textures by navetsea:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6554\r\n\r\nUNP fitness body by SvarogNL: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=16731\r\n\r\nRANs Headmesh: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7127\r\n\r\nElf Ears by numenume:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13173\r\n\r\nHair by Apachii:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168\r\n\r\nEyebrows Match Hair by Aluminumfoil: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=627\r\n\r\nFlans Eyes by DarNilavu (original textures by DustinFlan):\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14539\r\n\r\nFreckles by Zhoken:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=515\r\n\r\nSage Outfit Retexture by Dreamburrow: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17699\r\n\r\nOriginal Sage Outfit Backsteppo: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9387\r\n\r\nCalientes Texture Blender:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5737\r\n\r\nUNP Neckblend by SvarogNL:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15921\r\n\r\nUNP Bodyblend by SvarogNL:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=16263\r\n\r\nNifskope: http://niftools.sourceforge.net/wiki/NifSkope\r\n\r\nBethesda for the game engine.\r\n\r\nNote: I have received approval to use almost all of these.
