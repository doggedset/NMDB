  "summary": "Replaces the werewolf model with a more wolf-like variant.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Naturalistic Werewolves replaces the default werewolf model with a heavily modified version intended to look dangerous without looking grotesque-- inspired, in part, by the werewolves of Bloodmoon.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it makes some changes to the werewolf transformation animation. The character\\'s items are unequipped before the animation plays, and the werewolf model fades in closer to the character model for a more natural look.\r\n\r\nIf you use this mod with any other mod that alters the appearance of werewolves, make sure that Naturalistic Werewolves loads last.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The zip I uploaded originally included an incorrect file that prevented people from seeing the new model-- I\\'ve uploaded a new version that should work.",
