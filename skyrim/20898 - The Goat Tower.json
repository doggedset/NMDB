  "descriptionHtml": "The Goat Tower is a (borderline) lore-friendly platform challenge just north of Rorikstead.  See if you can jump your way to the top and find the key to get inside.  \r<br />\r<br />Once inside, you&#39;re welcome to use The Goatkeeper&#39;s Lodge as a player home.  I don&#39;t want to give too much away, but it does include all the basic amenities.  And a few extras...\r<br />\r<br />NOTE:  I have not thoroughly tested the &#39;player home&#39; aspect of this mod, so you may want to be careful when using the containers, weapon rack, etc.  The interior cell is navmeshed and companion-friendly (I think).  It SHOULD all work just fine, but you never know.\r<br />\r<br />Screenshots and comments are welcome.",
