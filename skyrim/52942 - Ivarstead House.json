  "descriptionHtml": "My first Skyrim mod, and hopefully not the last. Something small. If you have any comments or suggestions, please tell me. We can all learn from one another.\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s well... a house. In Ivarstead. I guess it&#39;s a rest stop I suppose? Oh, and it&#39;s lore-friendly. Sure. Once upon a time there was this guy. He built a house, only to subsequently die. Murdered by a duck, tripped on a pebble and got stabbed by a twig in the eye. Not sure, don&#39;t care, but he let YOU, yes YOU, the dragonborn, have his house. \r<br />\r<br />Still, don&#39;t mess with ducks. They WILL get back at you. The guy who built that place learnt the hard way.\r<br />\r<br />Have at it. There shouldn&#39;t be any conflicts since it uses all vanilla objects. Oh, and all my screenshots are from the CK. My computer but a simple laptop I received three years ago, and while I&#39;m building my computer, I only have four parts.\r<br />\r<br />Really quick FAQ:\r<br />\r<br />-&#34;Where is it?&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Tad bit to the south of Ivarstead. I said Ivarstead four times already, including the title. Can you not read?\r<br />\r<br />-&#34;IT&#39;S SO CRAMPED AND TINY HOW CAN I FIT MY DOVAKIIN&#39;S EGO IN THIS SMALL PLACE?&#34;\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s meant to be tiny. This is my first mod.\r<br />\r<br />-&#34;MARI U SUK STAP MAKIN MADS&#34;\r<br />\r<br />No.\r<br />\r<br />---",
