  "descriptionHtml": "  I was looking around at mods, and I had heard a LOT about Leveler\\'s Tower. I never liked it, but I just saw the main image of a boring tower. I didn\\'t know about the massive understories!\r\n  So, I got it immediately. As soon as I entered, I was AMAZED! However, I usually sell my items, so I \r\ndidn\\'t have much to put in. It was mega empty.\r\n\r\n  After about an hour and a half of copying and pasting, I ended up making this! It\\'s a bat command that gives you all the items in the game. When you enter the tower, enter:\r\n  bat allitems\r\n\r\n  And then, once you\\'re in the sorting area (it looks like a candy factory, in my opinion), press the big button, and voila! You\\'ve officially filled the tower! I prefer to use the code a LOT at once, so that way I have a really massive inventory.\r\n\r\n  Please note not to use it on the field, as any loading screen will be hella long, and probably a CTD from overloading. Only in the first room of the tower!",
