  "descriptionHtml": "Atmora : The land of truth\r\n\r\nLore :\r\nAtmora is the continent to the north of Tamriel, tradition holds that it was from here that the first humans came to Tamriel.\r\nThere is some suggestion that, as of the early Third Era, it was still inhabited. However, expeditions there in the mid to late Third Era only found a place of permanent winter, with little life and no sign of human habitation. It\\'s suspected that the land no longer supports any civilized life\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n4 weapons\r\n4 types of protonord undead (leveled)\r\n\\'\\'custom\\'\\' weather (compatible with COT but uses moded vanilla for know , but I will do a COT version )\r\nWeapon stats (the 3d mesh is that of the nord hero)\r\n\r\nProto Nord War Axe\r\nDMG 16\r\nreach 1.0000\r\nSpeed 1.3000\r\nCrit DMG 6\r\nCrit mult 2.0000\r\n\r\nProtoNord BattleAxe\r\nDMG 41\r\nreach 1.0000\r\nSpeed 0.3400\r\nCrit DMG 5\r\nCrit mult 0.9000\r\n\r\nProtoNordGreatsword\r\nDMG 23\r\nreach 1.4500\r\nSpeed 0.5500\r\nCrit DMG 25\r\nCrit mult 1.5000\r\n\r\nProtoNordSword\r\nDMG 8 \r\nreach 1.0000\r\nSpeed 2.0000\r\nCrit DMG 21\r\nCrit mult 10.0000\r\nHow to get there?\r\ngo to solitude , there is a new boat there . walk on it and you will be able to go there.\r\n\r\nThe mod is ready for play , but as with all my landscape mods , it will be expanded but unlike falkreath creek , this version IS made to be played and is not an alpha but rather a finshed\r\nproduct that will be expanded on.\r\nPlans for the future?\r\nnothing to extreme apart from that I will be adding more terrain to the north but it will be very barren.\r\nbut I will also be updating falkreath creek and giving you more landscape mods , also working on skywind and beyond skyrim\r\nHave fun !",
