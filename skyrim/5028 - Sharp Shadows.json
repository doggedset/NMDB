  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ff0000]Changing Ugrids above 5 and saving afterwards will make your save reliant on the higher value. Making a back up of your save file or not saving until you decide you like it is a good idea.There is a way to manual set ugrids in game back down to 5. Instructions at very bottom. \n<br />** Remembr You will Have to SET your Resolution Manually!!!! As well sD3DDevice=\"Graphics Card Name Here\"   keep the \"\"\n<br />ATI User need to set FXAA to 0****** All these settings are found in SkyrimPref.ini Remember to uncheck read only, edit, then reapply via properties!![/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00e5ee]Theres 2 files 7 Ugrids for Quad+ core computers with 4+ Gigs of ram. Then a 5 U grids file for Dual cores with only 2+gigs of ram with reduced settings. Shadow  still look awesome!  I fixed it they can look good in lower resolution! Let me know how the EcoFriendly runs for you and report your Comp Full specs!! Ps: this ini does a little more than smooth shadows[/color]\n<br />[color=#00e5ee]In SkyrimPrefs.ini you'll need to find and change these 4 settings under the [Display]!! First  Right click the file go to properties and uncheck READ ONLY apply make changes then re check READ ONLY and apply or the game will mess up all the settings. If you have more than 4 cores simply go into Skyrim.ini and change iNumHWThreads=4 to 6,8 or whatever the number of cores!!![/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00e5ee]As well there are just the shadow settings below It will make them look like they should had. But, You won't get all the little goodies in the ini files[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00e5ee]bFXAAEnabled=1 for Nvidia 0 for ATI   (Probably not necessary anymore, Keep it 1 for all)[/color]\n<br />[color=#00e5ee]sD3DDevice=\"NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460\"  &lt;--Type your graphics name inside the \"\"[/color]\n<br />[color=#00e5ee]iSize W=1920[/color]\n<br />[color=#00e5ee]iSize H=1080            This is your Resolution settings[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00e5ee]      [/color]  \n<br />\n<br />[color=#00e5ee]    Also, I recommend this mod. It' makes lighting/shader effects very nice. I up gamma/brightness with it. I actually stopped using Nvidia Ambient Occlusion Because this does it better no difference having it enabled with this mod &amp; if you have ATI you can have ambient Occlusion!!!@![/color]\n<br />[color=#00e5ee]          Skyrim Enhanced Shaders   Name of mod. [/color]\n<br />[color=#00e5ee]  http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=822[/color]\n<br />[color=#00e5ee]      [/color]\n<br />[color=#00e5ee]Also Increased Performance TSEV Acceleration Layer: This will increase your FPS by up to 40%.[/color]\n<br />[color=#00e5ee]http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1321575-rel-tesv-acceleration-layer/[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00e5ee]       Going to your ATI or Nvidia Control center and putting Contrast Ratio to 100 will make colors look alot better in general. I don't know why its at 50 by default. Contrast Ratio decides how dark the darks are from the lights.  [/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00FF33]\n<br />Endorse it if you like it please. \n<br />My Comp settings I use 9 Ugrids\n<br />Quad Core BE 955 3.2 ghz\n<br />460 SE OC. 840 core clock &amp; 1850 Memory \n<br />4gigs ram 1600 mhz\n<br />[/color]\n<br />[color=#FF0033]\n<br />\n<br />[/color]\n<br />[color=#00FF33]\n<br /> This is the best I could get shadows to look period. Now i can finally enjoy the game. The view distances have been carefully tweaked so you don't discover Greyed out areas. This is for Realistic playing with good graphics.\n<br />If you play with Ambient Occlusion &amp; get flickering download the 290.53 Beta driver from Nvidia.  \n<br />Or just use the Skyrim Enhanced Shadows mod way better in my opinion :D\n<br />[/color]\n<br />[color=#FF0033]\n<br />\n<br />[/color]\n<br />[color=#00FF33]\n<br />Just the shadow settings below. You can add  these settings to your current .ini's. Go to Documents/My Games/Skyrim You may need to right click properties uncheck read only . Edit, Save, then re apply read only. Theres other graphics tweaks in the DL ini. Made for a 4gig+ system with a GTX 460 or better. ATI cards will have to FXAA=0 \n<br />            ~*This part is for you to edit your EXISTING Ini files not to download and edit*~ \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />           I recommend backing up INI &amp; opening Launcher make sure graphics are where you've been playing OK it then exit. Go to .INI files \"My Documents/My Games/Skyrim edit then right click properties Check Read Only so nothing can change the values without you know. Good Luck!!&amp; Enjoy!! and happy Holidays!!!!!!   \n<br />All Options should be in your default INI simply change the values. Use Ctrl + F in Note Pad to quickly find pacific settings. \n<br /> ||||||||||||||||SkyrimPref.INI|||||||||||| \n<br />        [Display]\n<br />fShadowLODMaxStartFade=6000.0   \n<br />iShadowMapResolutionPrimary=4096\n<br />iShadowMapResolutionSecondary=2048\n<br />iShadowMapResolution=4096\n<br />fShadowBiasScale=0.1000\n<br />iShadowMaskQuarter=4\n<br />iBlurDeferredShadowMask=32\n<br />fShadowDistance=2800.0000\n<br />fInteriorShadowDistance=2400.0000\n<br />fShadowLODStartFade=1200.0000\n<br />iShadowFilter=4\n<br />iShadowMode=3\n<br />bTreesReceiveShadows=1\n<br />bDrawLandShadows=1              \n<br />bDrawShadows=1              \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />1=Yes 0=No\n<br />|||||||||Skyrim.ini|||||||||||||||\n<br />[Display]\n<br />iShadowMapResolutionPrimary=4096\n<br />iShadowSplitCount=0\n<br />bActorSelfShadowing=1\n<br />[/color]\n<br />\n<br />UGRID STEP DOWN FROM SAVED HIGHER UGRIDS\n<br />\n<br />This one works with that patch with no redness:\n<br />\n<br />1. Run Skyrim in windowed mode. (Change in launcher or Skyrimprefs.ini)\n<br />\n<br />2. Load your save and then with the game running get to your desktop either by alt-tab or ctrl-alt-delete and find your Skyrim.ini.\n<br />\n<br />3. Make sure the ini isn't read-only and change the ugrids to whatever odd number lower value you want (default 5)\n<br />\n<br />4. Save the ini and go back to the game\n<br />\n<br />5. Open the console by typing \"~\" (tilde), the key left of the 1 key. Then type \"refreshini\" (without quotes). Hit enter and type ~ \n<br />\n<br />to exit the console. \n<br />\n<br />5. Save your game, exit, and restart with that save. That's it!\n<br />\n<br />I find ugrids to load=7 is the most stable and much better than 5 obviously.\n<br />\n<br />Hope this helps someone! \n<br />CREDIT:tVEC \n<br />https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/2889806-tvec/",
