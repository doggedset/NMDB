Lost? Use [url=http://dbmap.uesp.net/]UESP.net&#39;s interactive map of Solstheim[/url] to help you). I added this challenge because some wanted to get the house the hard way.[/color][/size]\r<br />[/i]\r<br />[color=orange][b]Backstory:[/b][/color]\r<br />This project was borne out of a simple attempt at providing a place for me to bunk in while on the island. While it was good to have a home liberated from the Severins, the problem came when my character needed to go out of town and into the boondocks. \r<br />\r<br />Sure, I helped Neloth, I helped the Skaal and they made my character one of their kin, but there was no place to rest, to sleep, eat or drink or some place that could be called as home. Pitching a tent may help while bivouacking in the village, but there&#39;s no better security and comfort than a full home, especially in a place that&#39;s cold enough to turn your soup into ice in minutes.\r<br />\r<br />This effort took me some four days to complete, using many of the techniques I learned from past mod projects. It&#39;s also my first full player home mod without piggybacking on an existing vanilla home. \r<br />\r<br />While everything else were easily handled, such as laying in the statics, and it took me three hours to lay in the navmesh, about the most difficult thing I had to do was to install the lights. Yes, the lights, trying to figure out for an optimized versus all-on set-up, and that cost me about six hours.\r<br />\r<br />In the end, however, I decided on a latter take, and expecting the worst like flickering walls, that didn&#39;t happen, and from there I was able to finish it just before dawn.\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][b]Installation:[/b][/color]\r<br />[list][*][b]Nexus Mod Manager:[/b] After downloading, find the mod and activate it to install.\r<br />[*][b]Manual:[/b] open the 7zip folder, then drag and drop the .ESP file into Skyrim&#39;s Data folder. \r<br />[*]Mod Organizer: Installation should be a simple affair, through the downloader or manually.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[color=orange][b]Load List Information (IMPORTANT):[/b][/color]\r<br />Because this mod slightly modifies the navmesh near the Skaal village, this mod should be loaded [i]last[/i] should there are other mods (current and future) that do the same thing to that village cell.\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][b]Uninstallation:[/b][/color] \r<br />[list][*]Retrieve all items in known containers -- chests, cabinets, dressers, drawers, safes, lockboxes -- and then make a new gamesave. \r<br />[*]Quit the game, and then deactivate and uninstall the mod from NMM, or manually delete the mod (the filename is DB_Bayview_Playerhome.esp + DB_Bayview_Playerhome.BSA file).\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[color=orange][b]Upgrade (if it happens):[/b][/color]\r<br />Almost the same as uninstallation, except you still have to retrieve your items, create a new gamesave, quit, and then overwrite the .ESP file.\r<br />\r<br />[list][*]In NMM, activate the new version and it&#39;ll ask you to overwrite; select Yes.\r<br />[*]For manual upgrading, open the 7zip file, click and drag over the .esp files to the data folder and overwrite the old .esp.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[b][color=#f6b26b]Credit:[/color]\r<br />[/b]Lazz for his [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59596/?]Displays Modders&#39; Resource[/url] (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59596/?) \r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][b]Notices:[/b][/color]\r<br />Any planned changes to this mod will require my express permission, but redistribution or uploading of this mod to sites other than Nexus and without my authorization is prohibited.",
