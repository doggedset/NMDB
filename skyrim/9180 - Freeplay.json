You just came to Skyrim equipped with hunting bow, iron sword and 200 gold. All skills are about 15-20, I don\\'t know how to change them.\r\n\r\n There are 2 options. Imperial and Stormcloak. Imperial version means Imperials hold Helgen and Stormcloak version means Stormcloaks hold Helgen. I am pretty sure you can switch them as much as you want and it wont affect your save game. Just don\\'t run them together unless you want to watch brawls.\r\n\r\n Most houses in Helgen are not accessible. They are not accessible because there is no NPC\\'s in them, there no npc because I too lazy to add them. Well not exactly just because of that, navmesh is broken and not repairable, cannot add new npc\\'s without their faces being buggy. And in any case they would be just sitting around the house because they could not go out.\r\n There is a functional Inn, its Torolf\\'s Inn in Helgen, so drop by and have a mead.\r\n\r\n -Alternate New Game start\r\n -Partially alive Helgen(present npcs without fully implemented AI, holes in navmesh)\r\n -Fixed Dialogue(Ulfric,Tullius,Balgruuf,Ferengar,Irileth,Delphine,WhiterunGuard)\r\n -Disabled Word Walls and Dragon Lair map markers.\r\n\r\n If anyone needs any of these files, then anyone can use them for whatever they want. I don\\'t care and no credits needed. Take Care !! ",
