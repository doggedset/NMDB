  "summary": "This was an attempt to make cooler hairstyles by combining preexisting hair parts, and making certain hairstyles available to more races.  For example, this mod allows Nord characters to be bald with a topknot like the barbarian from Diablo II.  It is messy, however and buggy.  More details below.  This mod is for male nords and high elves only at ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Check the pictures to see some of the better hair options I\\\\\\'ve made.  They look pretty cool, without looking like they were ripped from World of Warcraft. However, I never bothered to clean out the combinations that didn\\\\\\'t work right, so you\\\\\\'ll have to go through a few weird ones to find the good ones.  \r\n\r\nOne bug I\\\\\\'ve been having that I\\\\\\'ve no idea how to fix is that when I use any style that uses the longest hairstyle in conjunction with a ponytail, said ponytail disappears when I save and reload.  If anyone can fix this, that would be awesome.  You can fix it and reupload without giving me credit, I don\\\\\\'t care.  I would just like this mod to work.",
