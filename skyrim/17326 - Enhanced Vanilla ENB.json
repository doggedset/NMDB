  "descriptionHtml": "Enhanced Vanilla ENB for TES Skyrim - V1.3\r<br />\r<br />By MTindle\r<br />\r<br />[size=5] [color=red] EDIT - THIS ENB CONFIG IS TOTALLY OBSOLETE NOW. SkyRealism - ENB Evolved, by IndigoNeko IS A MUCH BETTER, UP TO DATE MOD THAN MINE. YOU WOULD BE MUCH BETTER OFF USING HIS MOD. THANK YOU. \r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23765]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23765[/url][/color] [/size]\r<br />\r<br />This ENB is basically a &#39;neutral&#39; config, as it only uses the abilities of the ENBSeries binaries to provide Sun rays, SSAO, improved shadows, parallax support and DoF. Therefore it does not use the enbseries.ini to it&#39;s full extent and does not alter vanilla game colour AT ALL.\r<br />\r<br />Works great with Realistic Lighting:  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7654] skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7654 [/url]\r<br />\r<br />**Changelog**\r<br />v1    - Initial release\r<br />v1.05 - Incresed the sky&#39;s brightness to better match that of Vanilla&#39;s\r<br />v1.1  - Changed some settings under the &#39;FIX&#39; header in enbseries.ini - may increase stability even more (was already very stable)\r<br />v1.2  - Changed the folder structure to include more options (Fast SSAO and Slow SSAO)\r<br />v1.21 - Added option for no DoF or SSAO, this version only useful for those who want ENB for parallax occlusion mapping and detailed shadows support included with ENB.\r<br />v1.25 - Added diiferent Bokeh DoF options, just copy and replace your selected enbeffectprepass.fx file.\r<br />v1.3  - ENB v0.113 released by Boris Vorontsov, adds true Godrays effect to the game. ENB binaries download link updated and new options added to the mod. I&#39;m not going to bother including loads of Godray&#39;s strength options, as it would take ages to do and is easily tweaked by even a complete noob. To tweak open &#39;enbseries.ini&#39; in the Skyrim root folder, navigate to the very bottom and tweak the &#39;SunRaysMultiplier&#39; value yourself. Lower values=less visible rays, Higher values=more visible rays.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />**Description**\r<br />This ENB is very minimalistic in what it changes; all it does is add Depth of Field, Sun shafts and optionally SSAO as well. There really isn&#39;t much else to say.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />**Features**\r<br />.True Godrays,\r<br />.Parallax Occlusion Mapping support,\r<br />.Bokeh Depth of Field,\r<br />.Slight Chromatic Abberation,  \r<br />.Vanilla colours are EXACTLY the same as original,\r<br />.Optional SSAO with Indirect Lighting.\r<br />.Not much of a performance hit, it varies. My PC doesn&#39;t dip under 40fps without SSAO with a 1090T and a GTX 460 1gb. With SSAO on though, it can go as low as 30fps.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />**Issues**\r<br />For some reason the Sky gets slightly darker when ENB is toggled on, not very noticable.*Fixed in v1.05*\r<br />It depends on what you call an issue, but the vanilla eye adaption remains which some find annoying.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />**Installation**\r<br />1.Extract all of the files from the &#39;Enhanced Vanilla ENB&#39; folder that you want to the game root folder (Where TESV is located)\r<br />2.Follow this link [url=http://www.enbdev.com/mod_tesskyrim_v0113.htm] (http://www.enbdev.com/mod_tesskyrim_v0113.htm) [/url] and click on the arrow to download the v0.113 KAGE binaries. Open the folder you just downloaded.\r<br />\r<br />3.WRAPPER VERSION - Copy d3d9.dll and place it in the root folder. Start the game like you always do. Enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />  However, if you find that Skyrim crashes using the wrapper method, you must use the Injector instead.\r<br />\r<br />  INJECTOR VERSION - Copy enbseries.dll, enbinjector.ini and ENBInjector.exe and place in the root folder. You must start enbinjector.exe before starting Skyrim as usual.\r<br />\r<br />If you want to select a custom DoF profile, navigate to the &#39;DoF Options&#39; folder, choose your selected Depth of Field setting, copy and paste this into the Skyrim Root folder. Overwrite the original one. You&#39;re set.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />**Performance**\r<br />Firstly, to my perception the Godrays don&#39;t have much of a performance hit at all.\r<br />If you find that the screen effects are too much for your system, the first thing you should do is disable SSAO if you have it activated. (in enbseries.ini set &#39;useambientocclusion&#39; &gt; false)\r<br />Optionally, disable DoF and keep SSAO on, whichever effect you prefer is the one you should keep. Having BOTH effects on at the same is a\r<br />performance killer, only do this if you play at a low resolution/have a high end computer. HOWEVER, should you find that either the DoF or SSAO ON THEIR OWN is too much for your system, disable both in the enbseries.ini file. You won&#39;t get either effect but you&#39;ll still get much improved shadows and Parallax support\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />**Credits**\r<br />Boris Vorontsov, creator of ENBseries.\r<br />Tapioks, (enbbloom.fx, enbeffect.fx and enbeffectprepass.fx were taken from his mod)\r<br />Matso, for writing DoF code among other things\r<br />Myself for the idea and supplying all of the different DoF presets to choose from.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy,\r<br />\r<br />MT.
