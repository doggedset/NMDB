  "summary": "This file adds a code to the game through use of a batch file. Add the text document to your Skyrim directory to use. Once installed, the code to activate the batch is \\\"bat enchantments\\\".\r\n\r\nNow includes Dragonborn enchantments.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I know these things already exist on Nexus, but I thought I\\'d make my own. This code will give you a bunch of items with enchantments on them for you to disenchant at an Arcane Enchanter. Added together, the items weigh 28 units. All enchantments should be included. I used the list at uesp.com to create this batch. The items I used consist of iron daggers, silver rings, and one pair of iron boots for the muffle and water walking enchantments.\r\n\r\nTo install, simply extract the text document into your Skyrim directory. Do NOT place in the data folder. This will cause the batch to become unable to be located. If Skyrim is not installed through Steam, your skyrim directory should be;\r\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim (If using a 64x Windows OS)\r\nC:\\\\Program Files\\\\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim (If using a 32x Windows OS)\r\nIf Skyrim is installed through Steam, your Skyrim directory should be;\r\nC:\\\\Games\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\r\n\r\nOnce installed, you may use the code to give youself the items with the enchantments on them. The code to do so is;\r\nbat enchantments\r\n\r\nIf there are any problems with this batch (EX: Missing Enchantments, Bugs, etc.) please leave a comment on this post. I will try to fix any issues with the file.\r\nIf you have troubles using this batch (EX: Console says batch not found/could not be opened, etc.) please leave a comment on this post. I will try to help you solve your problem(s).",
