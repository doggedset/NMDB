  "descriptionHtml": "First of all THIS IS NOT A MOD. This file contains a PDF Document with each of the 10 archetypes that can be found in the Official Prima Game Guide for Skyrim. I Have done the calculations on percentages given by the book for attributes and have displayed them in an easy to read color coded manner with the total attribute points your character should have if playing as one of these archetypes. \r\n\r\n***If you are playing a Character with out following these \\\"guidelines\\\" it may seem you fall into an archetype that you weren\\'t meaning to play. The distributions of points in this file goes strictly off what was given.***",
