  "summary": "Why do the honest merchants and citizens of Skyrim have lockpicks anyway?",
  "descriptionHtml": "Removes the Lockpicks from the Merchants Lockpick Levelled List, and also from the three Citizens Pockets Lists -- Poor, Common and Rich.\r<br />\r<br />Some NPCs might still have some lockpicks in their personal specific inventory, but editing them would cause compatibility problems with NPC mods, maybe they just found one and picked it up...?\r<br />\r<br />The merchants stock should update as soon as you load the game, I think. But the lockpicks carried by NPCs [i]might[/i] need to wait until a respawn to change.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.1\r<br />\r<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Load Order\r<br />=========\r<br />Shouldn&#39;t matter I don&#39;t think (but read below), it should be merged into your [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1840/]Bashed Patch[/url] anyway.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Conflicts\r<br />=======\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28418/]Stealth Skills Rebalanced[/url] does the same as my mod but also much, much more. If you have my mod later in your load order than Stealth Skills Rebalanced it will conflict/overwrite so don&#39;t do that.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.2 will conflict with any mod that alters the 3 chests used by the caravan merchants.\r<br />Hopefully [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1840/]Wrye Bash for Skyrim[/url] will support the &#39;invent&#39; bash tag sometime soon and the conflict can be resolved using the Bashed Patch.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Disclaimer\r<br />=========\r<br />I made this after a user called [b]qwert[/b] made a post on the official Bethesda forums asking if there was already a mod to do this.\r<br />I made it using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859/?]TES5Edit[/url], but I don&#39;t have Skyrim running properly at the moment so I haven&#39;t tested it...\r<br />However qwert tested version 1.0 quite a bit and it appears to work ;)\r<br />\r<br />Feedback / bug reports welcome&#33;",
