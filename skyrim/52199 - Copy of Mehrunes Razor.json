  "summary": "A new blade that looks just like the &#34;Mehrune&#39;s Razor&#34;, but actually isn&#39;t. It&#39;s a reproduction of the long lost Daedric artifact. Even though it looks just like the original, it lacks the deadly enhancement and also the damage is slightly lower.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Ever wondered which dagger might suit you, while having the legendary, Daedric artifact -  Mehrunes Razor? Wonder no more&#33; Here&#39;s the solution to the problem of not finding any weapon that suits the blade (apart from maybe the Skyforge Steel Dagger, which looks O.K. with Mehrune&#39;s Razor).\r<br />\r<br />I created a new weapon called &#34;Copy of Mehrunes Razor&#34; which looks exactly like the original dagger, but has no enchantment and slightly reduced damage. It is assigned to the Daedric smithing tree and can be crafted when having the Daedric smithing perk. \r<br />\r<br />If you enjoy it, click &#34;endorse&#34; and feel free to leave a comment&#33; \r<br />Happy slaying,\r<br />Sacrive",
