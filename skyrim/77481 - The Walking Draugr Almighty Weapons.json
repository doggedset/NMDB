  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6]The Walking Draugr Almighty Weapons \r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=4]Almighty Dawnbreaker & Almighty Ebony Blade were just simple tweaks I did for The Walking Draugr by Kozuke Hajime. The weapons are enchanted with the same enchantment of the &#34;Regretful Shiv&#34; but they don&#39;t break or disappear after one use. I made it for the sole purpose of making a video demo more fast-paced because the &#34;Regretful Shiv&#34; was too tedious to use. In any case, I made a patch for it & sharing it to those who might be interested. Only use this if you have &#34;The Walking Draugr&#34; mod. Load the patch under it. \r<br />\r<br />REQUIRED (Credits as well): The Walking Draugr by Kozuke Hajime \r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77433/ \r<br />\r<br />Weapons are craftable & temperable at any forge, under Misc. Ebony Smithing Perk required. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]OvJQDW2kAUU[/youtube][/size]",
