This is my new, ongoing project that focuses on introducing high-res, handmade re-imagined textures for other mods and vanilla content.  The first mod to have this done, obviously, is the Chronicles of Steel - Nord.  With it, I created new textures for the weapons that carry the original style that Waalx introduced, but while giving each sword a realistic pattern weld (which I found to be extremely attractive) and more realistic materials overall.\r\n\r\nAll weapons have been completed, though updates will be coming on an individual basis after I release an all-in-one download (following a redo on most of the swords scabbards).  Something to note about these weapons is that a lot of the detail isn\\'t going to be captured in my screenshots, namely because I suck at screenshots but also because the detail is very, very fine and just like in a real weapon, you really wont\\' see it until you get up really close.  So don\\'t let the screenshots fool you into thinking these are of a lower quality than they really are. \r\n\r\nBut as always, endorse if you like it! It\\'ll keep me motivated! \r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i280.photobucket.com/albums/kk173/huMAnity_dues/forgenotes.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n6-29-2012 ~ All textures complete and released. First order of business following this (after I give my other mod some much needed attention) will be to redo scabbards to match the style of the Beserker scabbard, as I find that the Beserker scabbard is superior to the others. After that (which will also be when I will release all the textures in one single package), each weapon will receive individual attention as I feel up to it. \r\n\r\n6-25-2012 ~ Been a while, but I finished the Nordic Bow and its variants. \r\n\r\n6-18-2012 ~ Initial Release\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i280.photobucket.com/albums/kk173/huMAnity_dues/installation.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\nInstallation is very simple. Simply extract the Data folder in the file to your Skyrim Directory, and overwrite all of the original files.\r\n\r\nIn order to use the alternate textures for certain swords, simply open the folder of the sword alternate you want to use, and extract that Data Folder to your Skyrim directory, overwriting the original textures.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i280.photobucket.com/albums/kk173/huMAnity_dues/credits.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\nWaalx ~ Original Realswords Mod\r\nShingouki ~ His fantastic port of the original mod.",
