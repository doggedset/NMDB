  "descriptionHtml": "Requirements:\r\n\r\n- Skyrim patched to 1.8\r\n- Dragonborn DLC\r\n\r\nBackground/Explanation:\r\n\r\nIf you have gone thru the quests that Master Neloth has offered, then you know that Tel Mithryn is very isolated from any possiable help from the Skaal or the Redoran Guard in Raven Rock.\r\n\r\nNeloth may be a legendary wizard but he shouldn\\'t have to defend his home by himself. His steward is useless outside of of being a steward, his mirobiologist is useless outside of her field and his apprentice has to study and learn to be a better wizard.\r\n\r\nSo this addition proposes that Neloth brought two of the Telvanni Guard with him when he headed to grow Tel Mithryn on Solstheim, before the events of the Red Year.\r\n\r\nMod Detials:\r\n\r\nThis mod adds to Telvanni Guards to Tel Mithryn. \r\n\r\nThey are equipped with;\r\n- an ebony sword\r\n- an armored version of the Telvanni Robe\r\n- armored leather gloves\r\n- chitin boots\r\n-have access to basic destruction spells ( Flames, sparks) after all they are Telvanni Guards, so having a little magic skill help their combat skill is a plus.\r\n\r\nThey respawn if killed, but since Neloth is there I\\'ll say he resurrects them if they are slain, since they don\\'t have a town to draw new guards from.\r\n\r\nBugs: \r\nnone\r\n\r\nConflicts:\r\n\r\nnone, if found report them on the comments thread.\r\n\r\n",
