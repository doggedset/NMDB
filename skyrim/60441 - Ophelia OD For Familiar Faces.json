  "descriptionHtml": "This is another one of my characters Ophelia, made with a certain popular German model in mind. She is also basically a noob, I think I had her wearing Black Rose armor and skull ribbons , from here on nexus.Â \r<br />\r<br />Warning : will likely be nude without whatever mod I have my characters wearing. these are my characters I still play with, and I use cool armors from nexus modders which is why I share them, because I don&#39;t have the patience to get heavely into modding, so I do this to give back.Furthermore: I don&#39;t know if body type or textures make any difference if you have them installed or not so I will just list what I used to create them. My game isn&#39;t heavily modded, mostly I like armors and followers.\r<br />- I use xp32 maximum extended skeleton\r<br />- Unp BBP body\r<br />-Apachii skyhair\r<br />-sg textures and eyebrows\r<br />INSTALL MANUALLY - readme is in the folder, it&#39;s very simple\r<br />Requires familiar faces 1.1.3 and the required mods for that",
