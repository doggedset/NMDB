A mod-team contacted me and told me that they already converted them some time ago. \r<br />They promised me to upload their converted resources as soon as they have released the trailer for their mod. \r<br />\r<br />=========================\r<br />\r<br />Objects that are included in Part two:\r<br />\r<br />5 different shacks with interiors\r<br />dock kit\r<br />ship (no interior)\r<br />\r<br />2 different awnings \r<br />5 different overhangs\r<br />\r<br />Cyrodiil type buildings:\r<br />The tower and the nordhouse have interiors\r<br />For the other two buildings there is an interior kit to build your own interior\r<br />\r<br />Clutter:\r<br />hammocks, static and as furniture\r<br />baskets, static and movable\r<br />chandelier with candles\r<br />fishing net and herrings\r<br />tapestries and a rug\r<br />4 different tables\r<br />2 different stools (furniture)\r<br />shelf\r<br />Morrowind style lanterns and lantern hangings\r<br />(More lanterns, static and movable are available here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59977/?)\r<br />\r<br />=========================\r<br />\r<br />Read the included &#34;Original Sheogorad Terms Of Use&#34; and give credits as requested there \r<br />Read the included &#34;Original Sheogorad Readme&#34; to get an impression where all this comes from. \r<br />\r<br />=========================\r<br />Tools Used:\r<br />=========================\r<br />\r<br />Nifskope\r<br />NifUtils by Skyfox\r<br />Gimp\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Permissions:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />This is a modders resource.You may use the files for your own mods as long as you give credit to the authors and you do not charge money for it. \r<br />Please link back to this resource when you use it in your mod.\r<br />\r<br />You may use this resource in Skyrim Special Edition too.
