  "modName": "The Rabbit Hole - Hideout and Player Home",
  "summary": "This Hideout/ Player Home is perfect for a Thief-style character or a Dragonborn who is sick of all the fame and wants to find a quiet retreat away from all of the daily stresses of being a living-legend. Comes with all workstations, several mannequins and weapon displays and custom storage - taking inspiration from much of Elianora's work.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#ff0000][size=6][b][u]The Rabbit Hole\n<br />[/u][/b][/size][/color][size=3][b]Creator: TheFlyingScotsman[/b][/size][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]This mod adds a new hideout/ home in the mountains along the road to the East of Riften. Generally, I created this with a thief theme in mind but it could also work well with a humble Dragonborn who wants to avoid all the fame. There is no quest associated with this mod, just look for the skeleton and satchel in the broken down tower on the east road out of Riften and find the 'mysterious note' and key to open the hatch to enter the hideout, directly up the mountain ridge from the tower. \n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b][u][size=4][color=#ff0000]Features:\n<br />[/color][/size][/u][/b][size=3]- Fully Navmeshed\n<br />- Double Bed \n<br />- All Crafting Facilities (All Smithing, Enchanting, Alchemy, Cooking) \n<br />- Custom Storage \n<br />- Secret Vault filled with riches \n<br />- 6 mannequins and 14 various weapon displays [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4][b][u]Requirements:[/u] \n<br />[/b][/size][/color][size=3]- Skyrim [/size][size=2](up to date)[/size]\n<br />[size=3]- SKSE [/size][size=2](up to date)[/size][size=3] \n<br />- SKYUI \n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b][u][size=4][color=#ff0000]Notes:[/color]\n<br />[/size][/u][/b][size=3]- Should be compatible with most mods. \n<br />- This is my first ever mod so any feedback would be appreciated.\n<br />- Thanks to Darkfox127 and Elianora for all of their YouTube tutorials, they helped me out a lot when making this mod. Also, special recognition to Elianora for her signature custom wardrobe that I have tried to imitate. \n<br />- I used the Realistic Lighting Overhaul in the screenshots, so keep that in mind if you play with ENBs or Vanilla. [/size]",
