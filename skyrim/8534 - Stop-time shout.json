  "modName": "Stop-time shout",
  "summary": "replaces the last shout of the slow/time shout. it will almost freeze time for a duration of about 10 seconds.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod will make it possible to shoot 3-7 arrows (depending on your archery skills) in a split second, or fusrodah someone from one angle, and watch him fly from another ;). Have fun! \r\n\r\nBe carefull, if you use it to fast after eachother the game might not get back to normal. A restart will suffice. This is due to the fact that a stop-time shout in a stop-time shout will make it slower to the square, thus freezing the game.  Use at your own risk, you have been warned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\nsimply drop the superslowtimeslower.esp file into the data folder of your skyrim directory and you\\'ll be good to go. Make sure you check the box in front of `superslowtimeslower` at the data files. \r\n\r\nIf you want to de-install it, just remove the superslowtimeslower.esp file from the data folder of your skyrim directory. \r\n\r\nFeel free to leave any comments",
