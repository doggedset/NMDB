  "descriptionHtml": "Scary Nights v1.0\r\n\r\n     or\r\n\r\nScary Nights - Deadly Fog v1.4\r\n\r\nYou are not afraid of the dark are you?  Good!  With Scary Nights your journey to the darkside will be complete!  The night in Skyrim is not much darker then it is during the day and the mods I have tried were to dark for me to see anything more then a few feet away so I created Scary Nights.\r\n\r\nIt makes the night a lot darker but you can still see and you won\\'t have to worry about running into an enemy before you actually see them.\r\n\r\nScary Nights only modifies the weather of exterior cells.  It does not modify interior cells.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeadly Fog Version:\r\n\r\nThe deadly fog version changes the weather so it is always foggy and overcast during the day and night.  It is not for everyone.  Some like that type of atmosphere while others do not.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n\r\nDeadly Fog v1.2 - I updated the deadly fog version so that the grass isn\\'t as bright at night. \r\nDeadly Fog v1.3 - Updated 1 exterior cell.\r\nDeadly Fog v1.4 - Updated another cell.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n\r\nCopy the ScaryNights.esp into your Skyrim\\\\Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\n\r\nDelete ScaryNights.esp from your Skyrim\\\\Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nI am done modding and want to get back to playing Skyrim.  If someone wants they can make changes and improvements to this mod and upload it as their mod.  I am modded out and just want to enjoy Skyrim.  :)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQ:\r\n\r\nQ: My character seems stronger, faster, better then he was before.  Why?\r\nA: This is known as a placebo effect.\r\n\r\nQ: If you were moving at the speed of light and turned on your headlights would they work?\r\nA: Yes.  Light will pass you at the same speed no matter how fast you are moving.\r\n",
