  "descriptionHtml": "Essentially this replaces the Archmages robes that you get at the end of the College of Winterhold quests with the unhooded version with the same stats that Savage hammer gave in his mod. Found here http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4427\r\n\r\nAs far as I know it doesn\\'t have any bugs or things that will mess up the game. It should work on male and female and other than that I can\\'t think of anything else that could go wrong.\r\n\r\nSorry about the quality of the Screen shots my pc is dying on me atm and I can\\'t afford to replace it so I can run a pretty version of Skyrim Dx",
