  "descriptionHtml": "i originally made this because my Miraak was glitchy like hell and when Hermaeus Mora stabbed him Miraak just dissappeared so i couldn\\\\\\'t loot him, and i thought to do this to get his items. of course it includes the staff, the sword, the robes, boots ,gloves and mask. obviously this requires dragonborn and the bat file is set so Dragonborn must be 4th in the loading order of your mods, to use this open the the console (~) and type \\\"bat miraak\\\" just as in the image and press enter, the text file must be in your elder scrolls folder (where there is the SkyrimLauncher.exe)",
