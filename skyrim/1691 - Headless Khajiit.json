  "descriptionHtml": "Playing Skyrim today, I ventured into a cave. I had immortal mode on (health didn\\'t go below 1, I couldn\\'t die). There was this bandit guy in this cave. He was strong. And, well... this was the result. \r\n\r\n-Only one quest is done--the intro one. He\\'s level 81 with all perks, but not overpowered with his current gear.\r\n-Be sure not to transform into a werewolf, or it will go back to normal.\r\n-Fast traveling does not fix this. In fact, the head travels with you.\r\n-Going into first-person makes the head on the floor go invisible, but this is only because first-person makes your character invisible. Going back into third-person, you can see the head on the floor again.\r\n\r\nHave fun playing as the Headless Khajiit! \r\n\r\nPut the file in My Games/Skyrim/Saves.\r\n\r\nCredits to TheClassyPython, for the Khajiit save, which I used when getting my head cut off: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=158.",
