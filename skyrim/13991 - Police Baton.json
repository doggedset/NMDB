  "descriptionHtml": "A police baton weapon mod for Skyrim. If dual wielding, the offhand(left) baton will spin around, but the right will not. Also, when sheathed, the baton will stick out due to the positioning of the baton. I will try to fix this in the future, but it seems unavoidable for now. There are also some gaps in the mesh if you inspect the baton in the inventory, bu it is unnoticeable in third person view. In 1st person, the baton is below the FOV, but it shows up when you swing and when you look down, this is simply because it is an underhanded weapon. Feel free to comment and tell me any errors or changes you think i should fix/make.",
