  "descriptionHtml": "An addition to the Open Cities mod by Arthmoor. This adds Ladders, Barrels and Crate to the cities to allow you to reach rooftops and other places you can&#39;t normally.\r<br />\r<br />I played some Assassin&#39;s Creed: Black Flag on the weekend at a friends house. Whilst playing it I found my self just wanting to play my assassin/thief character in Skyrim instead. The one thing that was thoroughly enjoyable though was the parkour/freerunning.\r<br />\r<br />So i&#39;ve added some clutter to both Solitude and Riften to allow you to run along roof-tops and tried to interconnect them so that you don&#39;t have to touch the ground.\r<br />\r<br />I like playing with the Skyrim Sewers 4 also. I really want to play as a thief/assassin in 3 levels of a city, under, in and over :)\r<br />\r<br />Needed mods:\r<br />- Open Cities by Arthmoor\r<br />\r<br />Suggested mods:\r<br />- Skyrim Sewers 4 (You will need the patched version of open cities)",
