  "descriptionHtml": "==================\r\nDescription:\r\n==================\r\n\r\n\tHave you ever had the desire to roleplay as a member of a certain faction? Also, what's the point of roleplaying as a faction member if you have no faction mates to come along on your journeys? Patrol the roads with fellow Vigilants of Stendarr, fighting the daedra at every turn! Join a merry band of Orcish mercenaries! Recruit some Stormcloaks or Imperials to fight alongside you in valiant battle! Employ some Thalmor justiciars to quell the worship of Talos all over Skyrim! Hire Alik'r Warriors to help you find that mysterious Redguard woman!
