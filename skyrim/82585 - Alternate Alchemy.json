  "modName": "Alternate Alchemy",
  "summary": "Changes the way you brew potions, for a tidier, less gameplay exploitive experience. Also craftable Philters of the Phantom. Spooky!",
  "descriptionHtml": "Update to optional file\n<br />\n<br />Keyword added to the empty bottles, allowing apothecaries to actually sell them. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Update \n<br />\n<br />Increased the amount of skill progression per crafted potion to the equivalent of the amount gained by smithing. You won't shoot through the skill ranks, but it'll be faster than the old version. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />--About\n<br />\n<br />This mod changes the fundamentals of how alchemy works in the game. Instead of finding two ingredients with the same effect, you now follow static recipes, just like in smithing, to create the same potions avalible in stores. \n<br />\n<br />This mod adds 253 recipes to allow you to create almost every single potion in the game, as well as adding 18 brand new potions. The more alchemy perks you have, the stronger and more varied potions you can create. \n<br />\n<br />The recipes avalible in the vanilla game are now a lot more useful, as they will allow you to brew a specific potion without having the corresponding perk to do so. Just keep it handy in the inventory! \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />I created this mod because, while I liked alchemy in Morrowind and Oblivion, I never got along with it in Skyrim. The potions you brew all look boring with the same bottles and incredibly generic names. I also like to keep a neat and tidy inventory, because I'm slightly weird about that. \n<br />\n<br />I imagine that someone who never got into alchemy might like this mod, as the process is a bit simpler. And, to players familiar with it, this mod might actually be more balanced than vanilla, as stronger potions require rarer and more ingredients. You are also able to craft potions not avalible normally, such as potions of fortify speech, waterwalking, the dawnguard Blood potions along with a few others I can't remember. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />So, for instance, in this mod, a Potion of the Warrior, requires an empty vial (craftable at the smeltery), one portion of hanging moss and canis root. \n<br />The strongest variant of this potion, Elixir of the Warrior, requires an empty vial, one portions of hawk feathers, two portions of hanging moss and two rock warbler eggs. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />--Details\n<br />\n<br />For modders like me who like to know exactly what a plugin edits, here's the list. \n<br />\n<br />Adds - 253 new crafting recipes and 18 new potions. 1 new misc item. \n<br />\n<br />Edits - The two alchemy benches (with and without the table), the existing 18 potion recipes you buy from vendors, the description on the following perks; Alchemy 1-5, Benefactor, Poisoner, Physician, Experimenter 1-3 and Purity. \n<br />\n<br />This mod does not add any scripts, so it should be safe to unplug mid-save. \n<br />\n<br />This mod does not edit any of the existing potions or ingredients. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />--Issues\n<br />\n<br />Tasting ingredients is not needed anymore, and the listed effects on it are more guidelines to what type of potion they might end up in. I could have had basically blank effects on them, but that would require editing all ingredient items, which might cause some incompability. \n<br />\n<br />Any circlet of emminent alchemy, or similarly enchanted item, will just be a piece of snazzy headware. Again, I did not want to remove the fortify alchemy enchantment, to avoid incompatibilities. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />--Requirements\n<br />\n<br />You will need all the official dlc and the latest version of skyrim. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />--Patches\n<br />\n<br />Campfire compatability, by MisterB1969\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88512\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />--Installation\n<br />\n<br />Simply put the .esp and meshes folder inside your skyrim data folder, and activate the plugin. \n<br />\n<br />This mod does not overwrite any existing files. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />--Uninstall\n<br />\n<br />First, unplug the mod and delete the Alternate_Alchemy.esp\n<br />\n<br />Delete the files called potionempty, potionresistall50 and potionresistall100, located in your skyrim/data/meshes/clutter/potions folder",
