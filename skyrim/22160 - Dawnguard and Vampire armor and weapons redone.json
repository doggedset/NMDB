  "summary": "lousy Dawnguard and vampire wears got you down, well they let me down to, so heres my fix on that",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is just a fix for the epic fail known as the dawnguard and Vampire armor sets, basically, this makes it so that dawnguard armors is ebony quality, while a captain set of dawnguard armor i made is dragonplate quality, the dawnguard weapons are also ebony quality.\r\n\r\nVampire armor is now elven quality, with swords of elven quality(uses harkons sword mesh), the stronger set is Vampire royal armor, I renamed harkons armor \\\"Harkons Armor\\\" and made a full set of Vampire Royal armor,unenchanted, to be found in harkons room, the royal armor and harkons armor is glass quality(all armors gain smithing bonuses from their respective armor quality equals, ect royal vamp armor gets boost from glass smithing perk)\r\n\r\nI made this mod so I could slay/be a vampire in style and protection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\nMe - made the esp file\r\nBethesda - made Skyrim\r\nBethesda - made Dawnguard\r\nBethesda - overlooked many things that give us modders, even of noob level, chances to do what we do, yet still made an awesome game",
