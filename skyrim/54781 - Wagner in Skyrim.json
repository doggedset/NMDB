  "summary": "This mod adds various excerpts from Wagner&#39;s famous Ring Cycle into Skyrim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Ever wanted to feel like a Norse god while hacking away at bandits? Ever wanted to take Shadowmere into battle while hearing the screams of Valkyries at your side? Then this mod is for you&#33; For this mod I have taken excerpts from Richard Wagner&#39;s Ring Cycle and placed them at appropriate times while you are exploring Skyrim. You have the option to keep Skyrim&#39;s original soundtrack and have it alternate with this one, or remove Skyrim&#39;s soundtrack completely and have Wagner 100% of the time. To install, drag and drop the data folder into your Skyrim directory. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Also, these are the instrumental versions of The Ring. I felt like the vocals were distracting, but if enough people ask, I can put them in.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: This mod was based off of No_Aardvarks_Allowed&#39;s Personalized Music mod AND ALSO REQUIRES THE PERSONALIZED MUSIC MOD.\r<br />\r<br />Update: If requested, I could compile other Wagner operas into this mod, in separate downloads.",
