Why? So you, the downloader can play a memorable character you\\'ll grow to love. And dunno...just cos xD[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=2CB4BE][u]Saved Games and BATS?:[/u][/color] [color=84DC85]I\\'ve provided optional bat files for certain characters that can be used via console to tweak your gaming experience and so it fits their background and specializations a little better. Just certain perks so they\\'re not OP or anything.\r\n\r\nTrack this, I may add something that\\'ll peak your interest :)[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=2CB4BE][b][u]Characters[/u][/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a23/creeposaurus/Dragon%20Age%20n%20Games/thumb-1.png[/IMG]\r\n[color=455FD4][b][Name] Brye \r\n[Race/Sex] Khajiit Male[/b][/color]\r\n[color=F61332]*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*[/color]\r\n[color=F2B035]Brye is not your average sneaking, pickpocketing Khajiit. In fact, he is quite the\r\nopposite. He is taller and bigger than your average Khajiit.He has the build of a warrior, which makes it a bit difficult not to be seen (not that its a problem for him). Not to mention the green \\'hawk he\\'s sporting. It took about 6 imperial guards to take him down and bind him before he was taken to Helgen. Brye chose to follow Rolaf rather than Hadvar only because \\\"Khajiit wishes to sink his claws in the ones who wished to take his head\\\". So the save starts off in the cave in Helgen\\'s Keep. AFTER the spiders and before the bear (oh my).[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=F4F15C][b]Note:[/b] Brye\\'s hair, fur, and height was changed via console. I adjusted his height so he would be taller than any human, humanoid, and beast race in-game. Meaning he\\'s taller than a high elf. If he\\'s too tall for you, I\\'ve provided a bat you can use with the normal khajiit male height or you can always adjust it using the \\\"setscale 1\\\" command via console. If you decide to tweak his appearance, his fur and hair may revert back to its normal Khajiit colors.[/color]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a23/creeposaurus/Dragon%20Age%20n%20Games/thumb2-1.png[/IMG]\r\n[color=455FD4][b][Name] He-Who-Collects-Souls \r\n[Race/Sex] Argonian Male[/b][/color]\r\n[color=F61332]*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*[/color]\r\n[color=F2B035]A skilled archer who leads a quiet life hunting in the wilds of Skyrim. However, he does not hunt for their meats. He hunts for their souls, collecting them in Soul Gems. He was once a student at the College of Winterhold, specializing in Conjuration spells. Until one day, he summoned a Flame Atronach in the middle of a lesson and nearly set everyone aflame. Rumor is, he also carries Black Gems for the unsuspecting traveler. Starts of before its his turn for the chopping block.[/color]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a23/creeposaurus/Dragon%20Age%20n%20Games/thumb3-1.png[/IMG]\r\n[color=455FD4][b][Name] Lux \r\n[Race/Sex] Nord Male[/b][/color]\r\n[color=F61332]*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*[/color]\r\n[color=F2B035]His only home, Helgen, destroyed. With only the clothes on his back, he follows Hadvar to escape what is now a pile of rubble. Witnessing his mother consumed by the scaled beast\\'s flames, he knew he must fend for himself and pursue an unknown calling. Armed with only his experiance in hunting small foxes and rabbits, he will now face opposition beyond the once protective walls of Helgen. Starts off inside what I believe are the guard barracks.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=F4F15C]Note: You absolutely need \\'Playable children race\\' for this one. Before you even play, you shoud really consider installing the mod \\'Playable child clothes for child characters\\', unless you\\'re okay with him running around in his underwear xD. I\\'ve also fixed the health/magicka regeneration issue via console but have included a bat for that, just in case :)[/color]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a23/creeposaurus/Dragon%20Age%20n%20Games/thumb1-1-1.png[/IMG]\r\n[color=455FD4][b][Name] Emani \r\n[Race/Sex] Khajiit Female[/b][/color]\r\n[color=F61332]*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*[/color]\r\n[color=F2B035]Follower of Namira, eater of men. She\\'s been known to use seduction (and deadly cocktail of Skooma and mead), to lure her victims. When offered, Emani quickly took the opportunity to become an assassin for it\\'s \\'perks\\'. Caught in an inn with a bloody face and hands (and a half eaten Nord woman not far from her), Imperial soldiers did not hesitate to sentence her to death.[/color] \r\n\r\n[color=F4F15C]Note: Changed her size so she\\'d be a little smaller than a Khajiit woman. I included a bat file for that or you can do it yourself using the \\'setscale .95\\' command. I\\'ve also included another bat file if you choose to make her a \\\"Man-eater\\\". It\\'s the same thing as wearing the Ring of Namira, only, you\\'re not wearing it.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=2CB4BE][u]Mods Used:[/u][/color] [color=84DC85]In each rar I\\'ve included a Readme with a list of mods used so you can get their exact appearance as in the photos. Also so this description wouldn\\'t become TL;DR. I\\'ve also include installation and bat instructions. If there are any issues or you need help, send me a quick pm :)[/color] \r\n\r\n[color=2CB4BE][u]Credits:[/u][/color] [color=84DC85]Thanks to Children of Cyrodiil for their simple solution for the Health/Magicka regeneration issue for the child race and everyone else for their incredible mods that have greatly improved my gameplay experience![/color]",
