  "descriptionHtml": "Although the Bright Wizard\\'s robes look totally different, I wanted to add a fire themed robe and I loved their style.  This is my second texture but I have more planned.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATED v2.0\r\n\r\nRecreated the texture to accommodate the female version.  I changed the shoulders to all metal and added more depth to the bump map.  Still needs a few tweaks but I\\'m still learning.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATED v1.1\r\n\r\nI am planning to do a female version but may put it off til later.  It still looks too cartoony but it is above my skill level at this moment to remove the illustrated look.  As I get better, I will come back and make corrections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease notes v1.0\r\n\r\nWork in progress.  I still need to finish the belt and I want to make it look less illustrated.  I am releasing it now for review and suggestions.",
