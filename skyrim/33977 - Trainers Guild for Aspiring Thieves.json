What better way to use all that coin you&#39;ve been saving up other than Skooma, Women and Entertainment?&#33; Not to mention some of the most notorious criminals from all over Tamriel under one roof to provide you with all the skills necesarry to make a honest living, for a price of course. So step right in, and let us wash all your worries away&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]What this mod adds: [/b]\r<br />*New area Dusk Till Dawn Cornerclub  \r<br />*6 New Master Trainers (Offers Training) \r<br />*2 New Fence&#39;s (Buy/Sells Regular and Stolen Items) \r<br />*1 New Skooma Potion (With real effects) \r<br />*1 Misc Quest (No journal entrys, just have fun with it)\r<br />*1 Player Home/Room (Purchase from Dealer) \r<br />*2 Choices for personal Entertainers for room (Stud for the ladies, and a Hottie for the Gents.)\r<br />*Set up to play with Skyhighrim mod (Hence all the Shrooms)\r<br />*Tons of Unique Items\r<br />*And a few very Special Items\r<br />\r<br />[b]Location:[/b]\r<br />*Dusk Till Dawn Cornerclub can be found in the walls of Whiterun.

Price is dependent on your speechcraft. Once bought, you have to read the Deed for key to appear. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Credits: [/b]\r<br />*Thanks to my girl for all her work on this, and creating the penthouse.\r<br />*Thanks to Kekai Kotaki for his artwork for the Guild Wars Two, which I use for the cover of this mod.\r<br />*Thanks to Bethesda for Skyrim and the Creation Kit. \r<br />*Thanks to Steamworkshop and the Skyrim Nexus. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Semi-Spolier: [/b]\r<br />*Easter eggs, special and unique items are scattered thoughout the mod. Some are easy and others are hard to find. Search around, you never know what you&#39;ll find.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Special Note:[/b]\r<br />*I have made this mod alot more challenging, it will take skills to access all the parts of the Cornerclub, even getting to some trainers. Simply act like a thief, and the rewards and truth surrounding this club will fall into place. \r<br />*I wouldn&#39;t recommend the misc quest to low level players, though not impossible. I made it hard cause of the great rewards you&#39;ll be hauling out with.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Note on Versions:[/b]\r<br />Dawnguard versions are the original, they have more content and all around better in my opinion. The Non-DLC versions were made for people that don&#39;t use Dawnguard. Changes vary between the two from minor to major changes. Use Dawnguard if you have Dawnguard, and use the Non-DLC version if you have no official DLC packs.\r<br />\r<br />==========================================================================================================================================================\r<br />\r<br />[b]Mods I recommend using with mine and may see in the screenshots:[/b]\r<br />*A Draugr Rextexture by Tameiki \r<br />*aMidian Born Book of Silence by CaBaL \r<br />*ApachiSkyHair by Apachii \r<br />*Basvanbeu Muscle Texture by Basvanbeu \r<br />*Better Males by Chris57 and FlavoredSoul \r<br />*Detailed Faces v2 by Xenius \r<br />*Dimonized UNP by Dimon99 \r<br />*Dovahkin Relaxes by Wgstien \r<br />*Enhanced Blood Textures by dDefinder \r<br />*Enhanced Lights and FX by Anamorfus \r<br />*Female Face Retexture by Navetsea \r<br />*Hectrol Caves Deluxe by Hectrol \r<br />*Hybrids HD Plants and Herbs by Gabriel Gullbergh-Mystikhybrid \r<br />*Immersive Hud by Gopher \r<br />*Improved NPC Clothing by Baron David \r<br />*More Bony Skeletons and HD skeleton clutter by Jerminator \r<br />*No More Blocky Faces by Xenius \r<br />*Perfect Legionaire by Ali Bengali \r<br />*Project Reality by JJC71 \r<br />*Proper Dark Brotherhood Armor Retex by Stivmachine \r<br />*Ruins Clutter Improvement by RaiserFX \r<br />*Skyrim HD-2k Textures by NebuLa \r<br />*SkyUI by SkyUI Team \r<br />*Soulgems v2 by Darkriegn \r<br />*Static Mesh Improvement Mod by Brumbek \r<br />*Straight Hair Retexture by Navetsea \r<br />*The Eyes of Beauty by Gabriel Mailhot \r<br />*The Dance of Death by DaedalusAI \r<br />*Thieves Guild Major Retex by Valstein0 \r<br />*Ultimate HD Fire Effects by BuzzDee84 \r<br />*Vampire Lord Retexture by Dr Fring \r<br />*Visable Windows by Isoku \r<br />*W.A.T.E.R by Sparrow Prince \r<br />*XCE Warpaint and Dirt by Xenuis \r<br />*YY Anim Replacer by Yukl \r<br />*QuietCool ENB by WolfStryder",
