  "descriptionHtml": "There is now a complete tutorial on how this spell was made, complete with scripts and screenshots. It\\'s available here:\r\nhttp://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/704069-actor-magnet-tutorial/page__view__findpost__p__5585851\r\n\r\nDubbed \\\"Katamari Dovahkiin\\\" by Reddit, this Alteration spell sends all actors in the area flying toward you at high speed. They will collect into a Katamari-like ball that will roll around as you run. It doesn\\'t serve any useful purpose and is just for fun. Cast once to toggle it on, cast again to toggle it off. With practice you can slingshot the entire ball a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nFlying around with the Magnet turned on. This may be the greatest Skyrim video ever created:\r\n[youtube]CUZzBhn5NpE[/youtube]\r\n\r\nAwesome Gamespot Review:\r\n[youtube]sPryiP6JvxE#t=476s[/youtube]\r\nGamers Dissent has a GREAT demo of this:\r\n[youtube]Ry-6UD7keT4[/youtube]\r\nThanks dude!\r\n\r\nDigitalPeter reviewed my spell here:\r\n[youtube]73YNruEpLLw[/youtube]\r\nThanks man! Chick magnet indeed ;)\r\n\r\nHere\\'s a demo video of the spell:\r\n[youtube]UoRAf01R3rA[/youtube]\r\n\r\nHere\\'s the video I posted that led to people asking for the spell (video starts at 0:40 seconds):\r\n[youtube]9FTUel2-WPA[/youtube]\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n========\r\nThe tome is lying in the main hall of Dragonreach. You can\\'t miss it, it\\'s on the carpet in front of you as soon as you step inside. Note that the spell\\'s in-game name is Actor Magnet.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n=====\r\nThis spell HAS NO USEFUL PURPOSE. It is not balanced, it has not been well-tested, and it will probably cause crashes. It\\'s basically a gag spell and exists only for entertainment.\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\nThis spell arose as a mistake while developing a new mod. The effect was funny and I posted a video on Youtube about it. Turns out a lot of people wanted it, and who I am to argue? I cleaned it up a bit and here it is.\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nNone, as far as I know.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nThis spells causes CTDs if you collect too many actors at once. I\\'m not sure what the limit is, it probably varies, but if you run around outside with it collecting giants, bandits, and critters, it will almost always crash eventually. Seems fine in towns. \r\n\r\nDoes not attract summoned actors like Atronachs or Skeletons. \r\n\r\nDoes not attract supermassive actors like Mammoths and Dragons. \r\n\r\nTodo\r\n====\r\nNothing. This spell is just for fun and has no development future.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n=======\r\n\r\n1. Extract this archive to any folder and then copy the contents to Skyrim\\'s Data folder.\r\n2. Start Skyrim, click Data Files, and enable the ActorBall.esp file.\r\n\r\nOr simply use Nexus Mod Manager. ;)\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Start Skyrim Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the ActorBall.esp file(s).\r\n2. Delete the files/folders associated with the mod.\r\n\r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\ActorBall.esp \r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\Scripts\\\\ActorBallAbilityScript.pex\r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\Scripts\\\\ActorBallEffectScript.pex\r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\Scripts\\\\ActorBallScript.pex\r\n\r\nOr just use Nexus Mod Manager.\r\n\r\nUpgrade\r\n=======\r\nJust overwrite everything, no problem.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n1.0, 2012/04/14 â€“ Initial (and probably ONLY) release to Nexus and Steam.\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nverteiron@gmail.com\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim and the Creation Kit.\r\nThanks to Valve for providing an easy way to take my first baby steps in mod publishing.\r\nThanks to NexusMods for showing me the RIGHT way to publish mods.\r\n\r\nTools Used\r\n==========\r\n7-Zip\r\nReadme Generator - http://HammondsLegacy.com/obmm/tools_readme_generator1.asp\r\nCreation Kit\r\n\r\nLicensing/Legal\r\n===============\r\n\r\nYou must contact me and obtain my permission before re-packaging any part of\r\nthis mod.
