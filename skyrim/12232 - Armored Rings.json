  "descriptionHtml": "Description\r\n===========\r\nAdds armored rings to Skyrim.\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n========\r\nCreate them at any forge with one iron ingot.\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\nHave you ever wanted to wear some clothes, but they had no/poor armor rating? Like most games, you walk 5 feet away from any town and something tries to rip your face off. This isn\\'t Barbie\\'s Medieval Adventures, this is SKYRIM, there are creatures or people that want to kill/injure you. Wearing clothes or hide armor will not prevent that (very well). \r\n\r\nSo, in the interest of Roleplaying, I decided to add some armored rings to Skyrim. They come in Light and Heavy Versions, with the possible armor ratings of 25, 50, 75 or 100. These can be created at any forge with just one iron ingot. Why? Roleplaying waits for no silver ingots! As of 1.1, they are now improvable at any Workbench with one iron ingot!\r\nNOTE THESE ARE AFFECTED BY YOUR LIGHT/HEAVY ARMOR SKILL!!!!  I have a Light Armor Skill of 100, and the \\\"Armored Ring (Light - 100)\\\" has a total of ~227 Armor Points.\r\n\r\nThese use the basic silver ring textures. Want to wear other rings? Find a ring mod!\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n1. Extract the files to a temporary location.\r\n2. Copy files to (install folder)\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\\r\n3. Start Skyrim Launcher, click \\'Data Files\\', place a checkmark beside the .esp file.\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\n1. Start Skyrim Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esp file.\r\n2. Delete the files/folders associated with the mod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpgrade\r\n=======\r\n\r\n1. Overwrite the old .esp file.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nNONE KNOWN\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n1.0 - Initial Release\r\n1.1 - Adds ability to improve them.\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nPM Me.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r\nThanks to SkyrimNexus.com for the a one-stop-shop resource for authors and players.\r\nThanks to LHammonds for the Readme Generator this file was based on.\r\nThanks to God for creating us all.\r\n\r\nTools Used\r\n==========\r\nReadme Generator - http://HammondsLegacy.com/obmm/tools_readme_generator1.asp\r\n\r\nLicensing/Legal\r\n===============\r\nYou can do whatever you want with this mod but all I ask in return is that \r\nyou give me credit if you distribute any part of this mod.",
