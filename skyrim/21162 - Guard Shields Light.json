  "summary": "Changes all of the hold guards shields to be classed as Light armor, including the shield of solitude.\r\n\r\nThere are many justifications and reasons to do with coding but also ingame as to why i made this change, if your wondering just check out the long description :)",
  "descriptionHtml": "\\'`\\'`\\'` Brynnza\\'s \\'fixed hold guard shields\\'\\'`\\'`\\'`\r\n\r\nAlright so ill upload a few pictures in a while (theres no graphical change, but i love pictures :D who doesnt) but for now ill just wack the mod up there, its just a small change, making hold guards shields light instead of heavy class.\r\n\r\nReason for this?\r\n1-They are coded to be light (both the sound lines and stat line state that they are light in vanilla\r\n2-They also look light\r\n3-The rest of the guards armor build is light, you wouldnt use a heavy shield when your proficiency is light now would you (dont answer that)\r\n4-There are roughly twice as many heavy shield options over light shield options\r\n\r\nThats should be enough justification for the lore lovers out there :) and also for anyone curious about why this change came to mind.",
