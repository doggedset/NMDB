  "summary": "This mod makes fighting through dungeons quite hilarious and a little scary at times. It gives all the Draugr in Skyrim raging Tourettes syndrome with quotes from YouTube famous \\\"Tourettes Guy\\\".",
  "descriptionHtml": "All the Draugr shouts have been replaced with Tourettes Guy sound bites. Also most of the fx sounds have been replaced as well. Some of the conscious sound files I did not replace because repeating a one line phrase over and over was quite annoying so I only replaced one. About one in three Draugr is constantly searching for it\\'s pants. It makes for an interesting dungeon experience.",
