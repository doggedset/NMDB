  "descriptionHtml": "This is a small house on the shore of Lake Ilinalta.\r\nIt has all the crafting equipment except a smelter.\r\nTher are lot (26) of containers, no vanilla containers altered,\r\nnone respawn.The bed gives you well rested bonus (only appears in active effects).\r\nI kept the .esp clean, only one exterior cell altered.\r\nIt\\'s not navmeshed, as I didn\\'t read the tutorials this far. :)\r\nMap marker won\\'t show on map until discovered.\r\nEvery item in the house is static and every containers is initially empty,\r\nthat\\'s a choice.\r\nThe purpose is to have a small safe house that looks like any other farmhouse,\r\naway from big cities and in the same time allowing acces to all crafting\r\nequipment. I use smelter from Bilegulch Mine.\r\n\r\nThe screenshots were done without any visual mod (ENB or similar).\r\n\r\nYou can do anything with it, use, modify, redistribute.\r\n\r\nAnd of course if anyone finds an error in it, please let me know.",
