  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/15620-1-1335020807.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nFirst of all... sorry for my bad english :S\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n-Treva\\'s Retreat is a completely hand crafted exterior home (don\\'t use any load screen to enter the house) in the middle of the Rift. It is located north-east of Treva\\'s Watch, lore friendly and suitable for any kind of player, though it\\'s perfect for a ranger type of character. The house contains everything you need:\r\n\r\n- Smithing Area (anvil, grindstone, workbench)\r\n- Tanning Rack\r\n- Alchemy table\r\n- Enchanting Table\r\n- Mannequin\r\n- Weapon Racks\r\n- Weapon and Shield Plaques\r\n- Bookshelves\r\n- Safe storage\r\n- Cooking Pot\r\n- Chopping Block\r\n- Display Cases\r\n\r\n-All containers within the house are safe, so you can put your stuff there without any concerns (even in the cupboards, end tables, etc) . \r\n\r\n- With V2.0, I added a follower named Bulfrek who lives in this house. He also provides training in archery (Master)\r\n[center][IMG]http://i1064.photobucket.com/albums/u369/alb084/BulfrekNexus.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\n-If you wish to move your spouse in this house you will need to download the mod \\\"Spouses can live anywhere\\\" by Emma & Amgepo:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11370\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\n[center][IMG]http://i1064.photobucket.com/albums/u369/alb084/Location-1.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n-Just drop the files in the Data Folder\r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\n-It is not compatible with any mod that changes this cell, so if you have any mod that modifies the nearby area of Treva\\'s Watch, make a backup of your savegame and test it before playing a \\\"serious game\\\".\r\n\r\nIf you liked this mod ENDORSE IT!!!
