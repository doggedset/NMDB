  "descriptionHtml": "[center][IMG]http://i46.tinypic.com/20uprmf.png[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\nThe Severin Manor Player home included with the Dragonborn DLC is pretty well equipped but if your an OCD adventurer like myself then you may appreciate this addition. An organized Severin Manor Treasure Room with labeled chests for all your loot! \r\n\r\nInside you will find ten player owned chests, each labeled to match the Skyrim Inventory with a couple of extras to break down the Miscellaneous section into smaller parts. \r\n\r\nThere is a chest for Weapons, a chest for Apparel, a chest for Potions, a chest for Ingredients, a chest for Scrolls, a chest for Books, a chest for Gems, Metals, and Leathers, a chest for Soul Gems, a chest for Food, and a Miscellaneous Chest. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[B][U]Other Information[/B][/U] \r\n\r\nThis mod requires the Dragonborn DLC. \r\n\r\nThe piles of loot are for decoration only. They are static objects and cannot be picked up. This is to keep the room decorated and for game balance purposes. \r\n\r\nThis room is fully decorated, lit, and navmeshed. All interior data is set to match Severin manor. Works with and without ENB. No known conflicting mods at this time. \r\n\r\n[b][u]Updates[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.0 - Resolved the issue where followers were telling the player that they \\\"are not supposed to be here\\\".\r\n\r\n[B][U]Credits[/B][/U] \r\n\r\nJet 4571 - Picture frame .nif\\'s.",
