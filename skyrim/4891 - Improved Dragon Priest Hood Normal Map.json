  "descriptionHtml": "Improved Dragon Priest Normal Map v1.0 - by THEWULFMAN\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nI made a brand new normal map for the Dragon Priest hood (as opposed to editing the existing one). I wanted more depth to it, and I\\'m very happy with the final result. \r\n\r\nSame texture size, so you\\'ll have 0 performance loss. It\\'s a small change, but I like it, and I hope everyone else does too.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: This is the first normal map I changed of many. I eventually will be changing a LOT of them. I might make it into a large pack of all of them, if I make enough of them.\r\n\r\nPlease remember to endorse if you liked it, it\\'s the best way to show appreciation to a modder.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nCopy the textures folder to your Skyrim\\\\data folder. \r\n\r\nThis mod can be used with other texture mods. Just install it after your desired texture mod, and this normal map will be the one used.\r\n\r\nUninstallation: \r\nDelete the dragonpriesthood_n.dds file located in Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\dragonpriesthelm.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-Bethesda\r\n-THEWULFMAN",
