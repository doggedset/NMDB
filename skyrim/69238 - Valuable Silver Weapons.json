  "summary": "Simple mod that makes silver weapons way more valuable.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Given the expensiveness of crafting these items,it was always kind of annoying to me that you could get more selling the individual materials than you could crafting and selling them.\r<br />Well,that&#39;s no longer a problem&#33;Silver swords now have a value of 1,200 (rather than the vanilla 100) and silver greatswords are worth 2.400 (rather than vanilla 160).\r<br />If you have a weapons mod you would like to make a patch for, feel free. If you don&#39;t want to be hassled with it, comment the mods name and I may make a patch for it.\r<br />\r<br />This is only the begining of my mods. I have a lot of ideas I want to see through. If you would use my adfly link to help,I&#39;d greatly appreciate it&#33;[url=http://bit.ly/1O2nKel]\r<br />http://bit.ly/1O2nKel\r<br />[/url]\r<br />Very simple to install manually; just drop it into your Skyrim data folder.",
