  "descriptionHtml": "[img=center] http://i.imgur.com/X1sk8uU.png [/img]\r<br />\r<br />A mesh and texture replacer to give Shadowmere some scars (since the beast loves to fight so much), that feature animated glow.\r<br />\r<br />They will pulsate in and out, the pulsation being more evident at night.\r<br />The scars will still glow in the daylight, it&#39;s just the pulsation that is more apparent in darkness.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Features asymmetrical mesh and texture, courtesy of AlienSlof. \r<br />\r<br />I have also made her just a tad more slender, nothing really major - just reduced the size of the belly and the croup, arched her neck a bit and gave her head profile an Arabian curve. \r<br />Also gave her a longer mane and fuller tail, courtesy of Fierymarigold from her Swift Steeds resource pack.\r<br />\r<br />2 variations, female and male.\r<br />\r<br />Also tweaked file for users that have ENB and the original glow is too much. (I prefer ENB + Tweak since ENB has better shaders and the glow looks better, but to each their own as this is a matter of personal preference).\r<br />\r<br />Known *issue*\r<br />If you have Convenient Horses, the mane will not be removed upon equipping horse armor. I have decided to leave this as is, as making it compatible requires quite a bit of edits to the mesh by adding the behavior to do so. If it is requested, it will be taken into consideration. However, putting armor on her will cover most, if not all of the scars, so I see no point in doing so. \r<br />Not really an incompatibility, just aesthetic. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#C80000]A.N. Do not despair, the mod will not remove the bridle as shown in my pics. I only removed it to better show the texture and because that is how I like my Shadowmere.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Future plans include new tack (saddle and bridle). \r<br />\r<br />",
