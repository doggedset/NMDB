  "descriptionHtml": "This save game file has a modified Proudspire Manor house. Sorry for accidently uploading thumbnails. Scroll through the pictures and you\\'ll see full size photos.\r\nThe character is a Level 1 Nord Male. You can use the console commands to change sex/race.\r\nThe only quests done are the two required to purchase the Proudspire house.\r\n\r\nProudspire house modifications:\r\n\r\nAdded a bedroom on the main floor for the housecarl if you decide to do the thane quests.\r\nThe bedroom contains:\r\n\t1 chest\r\n\t1 wardrobe\r\n\t1 bed\r\n\t1 fireplace\r\n\t1 bearskin rug\r\n\t chair and a desk.\r\n\r\nAdded a pantry next to the cooking pot.\r\nThe pantry contains:\r\n\t3 barrels\r\n\t3 large sacks\r\n\t1 cupboard\r\n\t1 open crate\r\n\r\nAdded a 2 level Library/Trophey room:\r\nThe Library/Trophey room contains:\r\n\t82 display cases\r\n\t1 safe\r\n\t2 wardrobes\r\n\tfireplace\r\n\t1 bearskin rug\r\n\t15 bookcases (these are working bookcases which act like chests instead of the display bookcases)\r\n\t1 stairway connecting the opened floor library with the trophey room\r\n\r\nAdded a new basement/cave (Appears to be dug out of the rock Solitude is built on)\r\nThe Basement/Cave contains:\r\n\t1 chest\r\n\t1 Alchemy Lab\r\n\t1 Enchanters Table\r\n\t1 Smelter\r\n\t1 Forge\r\n\t1 Workbench\r\n\t1 Grindstone\r\n\t1 Tanning Rack\r\n\t1 Satchel (located on the Alchemy Lab)\r\n\tArchery range with three targets are various range\r\n\t1 Nocturnal Statue\r\n\t1 Dragon Statue\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe wooden circles around the Trophey room and Cave are place holders for mannequins once we figure out how to get them to work properly. Weapon Racks, Weapon Plaques and Display Bookcases also can\\'t be created correctly just yet so those are absent as well.\r\nThe house is sparsely decorated, I\\'m leaving you to that. \r\n\r\nTo install: Download and install in your save file. If you are not running the same mods I am, you will initially get a message about certain\r\ntextures not being able to load and asking if you\\'d like to continue. Just click yes. That message will only come up once.\r\n\r\nPhotos of the house can be found here. Sorry for the low quality on the photos. The new areas are huge and seem grayed out a bit. \r\n\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052665790/screenshots/\r\n\r\n*Update Edit: I\\'ve been very busy with other things. I give full permission to anyone and everyone to take this and turn it into a proper downloadable mod. Change it however you\\'d like. If you are going to share it with others, just please include Amrok\\'s Proudspire Manor in your title. Most likely \\\"YourVersion of Amrok\\'s Proudspire Manor\\\", but can even be \\\"YourVersion because Amrok\\'s Proudspire Manor sucked!\\\". Enjoy!\r\n\r\n",
