  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first texture mod ever so any constructive criticism would be much appreciated.  I took several screenshots of night and day comparisons with vanilla and modified textures to show the new normal maps and textures.  The textures are 2048x2048.  Hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\n(EDIT: The original has now been replaced with version 1.1.  Color adjustments have been made and the textures themselves have been redone to better fit the terrain, and offer a more realistic and mountainous look.)",
