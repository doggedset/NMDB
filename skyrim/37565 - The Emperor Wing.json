  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://static2.nexusmods.com/110/mods/images/37565-1-1377022114.png[/IMG]\r\n[center]Pelagius Wing... refurnished. Beautiful, organized and livable.[/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][i]About[/b][/i]\r\nThis is an attempt to remake the Pelagius Wing. Seeing that place left in ruins and all messed up was horrible... what a waste of a fine room in the Blue Palace. So I thought I could make some changes there, and so I did. Now the Wing is livable. Rooms, chests, mannequins, displays, NPCs and all. It\\'s worth downloading this mod.\r\n\r\n[b][color=red]Now this mod is known as Domus Imperatoris, and if you have an old version, before 4.0, please read the instructions below for more information on how to update. Or try the readme.txt found at the archive[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][i]Features[/b][/i]\r\n[list] [*]A new follower\r\n[*]New merchants\r\n[*]Lots of chests\r\n[*]Mannequins\r\n[*]Busts for your dragon priest masks\r\n[*]Holders for your dragon claws\r\n[*]Displays for your Daedric items\r\n[*]More displays for your unique items[/list]\r\n\t[b][i]Dragonborn Addon Features[/b][/i]\r\n[list][*]Displays for your unique Dragonborn items\r\n[*]A statue of Miraak (you need his items in order to activate it)\r\n[*]A training room with buttons for you to choose the NPC to kill[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][i]FAQ[/b][/i]\r\n[list] [*]Will this mod affect The Mind of Madness in any way?\r\n A: No, not at all. This was my first worry.\r\n[*]Will this mod conflict with any other mod?\r\n A: Only if this mod changes something in the Wing.  \r\n[*]Is this mod DLC-friendly?\r\n A: Yes. No problems found so far. Tested with all DLCs.\r\n[*] Does this mod require an DLC or another mod?\r\n A: The main file doesn\\'t, but the addons do. Each addon is described with the thing it needs.\r\n[*]Can I make a suggestion?\r\n A: Not only can, as you should. Suggestions are always welcome. If you find any bugs or problems, please report.[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][i]Notes[/i][/b]\r\nFeel free to make changes to the main file, or addons to it. Translations and things like this are welcome. If you are willing to upload my mod to other websites, please contact me first and give the right credits. I plan to adapt the rooms to receive unique items from other mods, but it\\'ll take some time, and it\\'s not certain yet. If you are coming from an older version, store ALL your items in some place else, outside the Wing. If Ahmad is your current companion, get rid of him. Leave the Wing empty. Then save your game, delete ALL the old files (no exception. Delete including the scripts) and then you place the new files inside your Skyrim\\\\Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][i]Credits[/b][/i]\r\nThanks to Vulon for voicing Ahmad. And, obviously, myself, for creating the mod and having the idea. ",
