  "descriptionHtml": "The Stark Family swords: Ice, Longclaw and Needle from the Game of Thrones Series by George R. R. Martin. \r\n\r\nI have remade Ice and several of the textures.  On my own machine It appears to fix the problem.  I hope it does for you all.\r\n\r\nIce, Longclaw and Needle are craftable from the Steel catagory in the forge crafting list.\r\n\r\nThey are all equal to Skyforge Steel swords, but require quicksilver as well to craft.\r\nTo spawn the swords in your inventory directly try this in the console:\r\n\r\ntype the ~ key to bring up the console, then type\r\n\r\nhelp <swordname>\r\n\r\nexample: help Ice\r\n\r\nthen hit enter and look for the numeric ID for the item, in the case of the Ice greatsword you may need to use page up to find it in the large list of Ice items. Then type\r\n\r\nPlayer.additem <numericID> <amount>\r\n\r\nan example would be\r\n\r\nplayer.additem 5B00182C 1\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n",
