  "descriptionHtml": "Out of boredom and my love for the Tropical Skyrim mod, I created 9 brightly colored Argonians to add to the atmosphere. Three are archers, three are mages, and three are melee. They level up with you. You can find them all in Whiterun, in The Bannered Mare. Perhaps I should have put a few in Riverwood?\r<br />\r<br />My first mod, so please bear with any bugs and let me know your feedback. I&#39;ll try to add better video soon.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Required mods:[/b]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?]Racemenu[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Recommended mods:[/b]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33017/?]Tropical Skyrim[/url] - highly recommended for atmosphere&#33;\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/981/?]Drachis Argonians[/url] - a fabulous retexture of the male Argonians - [i][b]As seen in all screenies except the first&#33;[/b][/i]\r<br />ksArgonianWarpaint - followers were created with additional warpaints, however, I could not get them to work in my own game??\r<br />\r<br />[b]The line up:[/b]\r<br />Wrath-Maw - An archer from Morrowind come to forge his own path after some revenge.
