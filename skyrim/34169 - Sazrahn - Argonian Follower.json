  "descriptionHtml": "\r<br />Sazrahn is a darn-skinned male Argonian. \r<br />\r<br />[b][font=Arial][color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Basic stats[/size][/color][/font][/b]:\r<br />[color=#9fc5e8]Location: [/color]Sazrahn&#39;s Den\r<br />[color=#9fc5e8]Fighting style: [/color]Spell-sword. Will use magic and/or a melee weapon. Will raise dead enemies.\r<br />[color=#9fc5e8]Level: [/color]Levels with player.\r<br />[color=#9fc5e8]Mortality: [/color]Essential (will go down on one knee while fighting if injured; will not die). \r<br />[color=#9fc5e8]Disposition: [/color]Neutral. \r<br />[color=#9fc5e8]Marriage?: [/color]Yes.\r<br />[color=#9fc5e8]Hiring Fee?: [/color]No.\r<br />\r<br />[b][font=Arial][color=#6fa8dc][size=4]More detailed info[/size][/color][/font][/b]:\r<br />\r<br />Saz comes with his own home, a den set underground near Bonestrewn Crest. I tried to make it reflect his not-really-evil-necromancer style, as well as one befitting an Argonian: it&#39;s meant to be a little dark and a little damp, with some magical and natural touches. It&#39;s fully navmeshed (though I don&#39;t consider myself GOOD at navmeshing) with idle markers and furniture, and he comes with an AI pack to use them. I&#39;ve also added navmesh outside on his little porch area, along with a chair and some idle markers.\r<br />\r<br />Sazrahn&#39;s Den comes with a map marker that&#39;s visible immediately, so you can fast travel to his house to grab him. Initially, I made the place owned by him, but I ended up making it technically player-owned to avoid complications. It&#39;s set as a non-reset zone and all containers are set to non-respawning, so you can store things if you&#39;d like. \r<br />\r<br />The main room has a magical fire, dining area, reading area, alchemy table, training dummies (which give skill XP with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32448/?]Dynamic Things[/url]), leaky corner with growing mushrooms, a necromancy area, and an enchanting alcove. A hall leads to the master bedroom, which has a double bed, fire for warmth (Frostfall friendly), table and chairs, nightstand, and storage chests. Off the hall is a mini-room with two extra cots and some crates. The beds are unowned so that anyone can use them; you&#39;ll get a rested bonus if you sleep here, but not &#34;well-rested&#34;. Saz will attempt to use the main bed to sleep.\r<br />\r<br />Cleaned with TES5EDIT. If the exterior navmesh additions/edits conflict with another mod or you just don&#39;t want &#39;em, you can safely delete those. He might path incorrectly or not follow you toward the door and then magically appear inside, but he won&#39;t explode into tiny lizard-man shrapnel.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][font=Arial][color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Why does he have his own home?[/size][/color][/font][/b]\r<br />I originally had him in Arcadia&#39;s Cauldron in Whiterun so that he was easily (and quickly) accessible. However, with so many mods that make towns more lively & add followers to Whiterun, it gets crowded FAST. I also like the idea of followers having a life outside of carrying junk around for the Dragonborn. I use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18045/?]My Home Is Your Home[/url] for some of my other followers, but since I made him and could already control his &#39;home&#39;, I decided to make one just for him. I thought it added a bit more to his character to make him feel a little less flat (check around for his notes, journals, etc.). \r<br />\r<br />[font=Arial][color=#6fa8dc][size=4][b]Required Mods:[/b][/size][/color][/font]\r<br />None\r<br />\r<br />[font=Arial][color=#6fa8dc][size=4][b]Recommended (but not required&#33;) Mods[/b][/size][/color][/font]:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19283/?]Argonian Raptor Feet[/url] (used in images)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2488/?]Better Males[/url] (used in images)\r<br />A follower management mod like UFO, EFF, AFT, etc.\r<br />\r<br />[font=Arial][color=#6fa8dc][size=4][b]A note about screenshots[/b][/size][/color][/font]:\r<br />\r<br />I took a stupid amount of screenshots due to the way lighting affects his skin tone. In dark light, he&#39;ll look black; in super bright light, he&#39;ll look greenish. I also included my older screenshots of him, crappy as they are, because they accurately show what he looks like with vanilla lighting & (mostly vanilla) textures. Newer screenshots are taken using Real Colors Real Nights (RCRN), High-Res packs, SMIM, etc.\r<br />\r<br />I also took lots of screens with him very scantily clad so that people could better judge what his skin-tone looks like. I don&#39;t necessarily recommend running around with a half-naked Argonian wizard, but it gets results.",
