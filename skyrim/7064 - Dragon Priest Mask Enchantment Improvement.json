  "summary": "Adds unique enchantments to Morokei and Rahgot, and changes Krosis\\' improvement material",
  "descriptionHtml": "I mostly made this mod for myself, I decided to share it in case it could be of use to anyone.\r\nThis mod changes the following masks:\r\nMorokei: unique enchantment of 150% magicka regeneration, and 25% shout time reduction\r\nRahgot: unique enchantment of 70 stamina boost, and 60% shout time reduction (useful if you are using Thu\\'um Mic, link below)\r\nKrosis: changed material used for tempering, the mask now requires that you use a Dwarven metal ingot to upgrade. I changed this due to the fact that Krosis is listed as \\\"bronze\\\" and it was the only mask that shared Iron Ingot upgrading, and no other masks use Dwarven, so it seemed like a perfect fit. \r\n\r\nCombine Rahgot with an Amulet of Talos, and get a Blessing of Talos for some awesome Thu\\'uMic action!\r\n\r\nLink for ThuuMic\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5626\r\n\r\nMake with SkyEdit, my thanks goes out to the team.
