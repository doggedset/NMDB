  "descriptionHtml": "Now you can craft soul gems from soul gem fragments and even other soul gems!\r\n\r\nUsing soul gem fragments (there are five different types in Skyrim) you can craft petty soul gems at any forge. You need to have the Enchantment perk, level 1 (level 2 for Greater gems, level 3 for Grand gems). Soul gems can also be \\\"updated\\\" to the next tier:\r\n\r\n3 Soul Gem Fragments = 1 Petty Soul Gem\r\n2 Petty Soul Gems = 1 Lesser Soul Gem\r\n2 Lesser Soul Gems = 1 Common Soul Gem\r\n2 Common Soul Gems = 1 Greater Soul Gem\r\n2 Greater Soul Gems = 1 Grand Soul Gem\r\n\r\nIn addition, you can craft 5 Lesser Soul Gems from 10 Petty Soul Gems.\r\n\r\nBe sure to subscribe to this mod on Steam Workshop if you like it, and please leave a comment or suggestion - it\\'s always appreciated!\r\n\r\nNote: I\\'ve only tested this with unfilled Soul Gems. It may be the case that filled gems will convert to unfilled gems when \\\"upgrading.\\\" If this is the case, please let me know and I\\'ll try to update the mod accordingly. Thanks!\r\n\r\nv.1.0: (02/08/12)\r\nFirst added mod. \r\n\r\nv.1.1: (02/09/12)\r\nNew Update. Changed 5 types of Soul Gem Fragments into one single type (the 4 other types were replaced by this one, but weren\\'t deleted from the game just in case...) so now when crafting Petty Soul Gems only 1 option comes up instead of 5 - makes it MUCH easier this way. Also, now crafting Greater Soul Gems requires Enchantment perk level 2 instead of level 1; crafting Grand Soul Gems requires Enchantment perk level 3, instead of level 1. For balancing reasons.",
