  "descriptionHtml": "[i]Trailer for current build[/i]\r<br />[youtube]vkN2lDCSyzI[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Formerly known as &#34;Werewolves Feel Pain Too&#34;, this mod started out as an addon for player werewolves in order to fill the gap where they wouldn&#39;t make a sound when taking damage. Ever since, I&#39;ve been developing this mod by adding &#34;taunt growls&#34; to werewolf npc&#39;s (mainly commanded ones). What this mod also does is to fix so that female players won&#39;t use the &#34;FemaleEvenToned&#34; (AKA Lydia) voicetype while in wolf form.\r<br />\r<br />There are four different collections of voice files to choose from:\r<br />Basic - Includes aggressive hit sounds, including a few from the vanilla game.\r<br />Very aggressive - alternative snarling hit sounds, fit for a strong werewolf.\r<br />Whimpering - more whining and panting hit sounds.\r<br />Pathetic - the hit sounds consists only of whining and yelping.\r<br />\r<br />Conjured werewolves will have their own, aggressive sounds no matter which version you install.\r<br />\r<br />What would also be nice would be if someone could animate the jawbone to actually lipsync, similar to dragons and hagravens.\r<br />\r<br />Installing:\r<br />You&#39;ll need WinRAR or some other unzipping program. Open the .rar, extract the plugin to your Data folder, then open the map containing the sound files of your choice and extract the sound folder to your Data as well.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />Should work with almost any werewolf-related mod.\r<br />\r<br />Known bugs:\r<br />NPC&#39;s who aren&#39;t set to use the werewolf voicetype in the first place after transformation will still talk normally. That includes Aela and Sinding. I don&#39;t consider that an issue though.\r<br />\r<br />Recommended mods:\r<br />Heart of the Beast - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13779/\r<br />American Werewolf Howl - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12188\r<br />As well as conjurable werewolf mods.\r<br />\r<br />I also recommend downloading a program that can convert fuz files to wav format, just so you can preview the sounds and possibly mix them depending on your playstyle.\r<br />\r<br />News/Future plans:\r<br />Nexus user DanielHodge has offered to co-operate with me as in voice acting for the werewolves. Keep an eye open for updates&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />sounddogs.com\r<br />\r<br />Don&#39;t forget to endorse if you liked this mod&#33; ^.^",
