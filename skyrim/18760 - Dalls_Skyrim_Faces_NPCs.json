  "descriptionHtml": "---README---\r\n\r\nfor DALLs - Skyrim_Faces_NPCs\r\n\r\nv1.3\r\n\r\n12/02/2013\r\n\r\nSkyrim_Faces_NPCs is face morphs mod which changes how common Skyrim denizens (NPCs) look. Regardless of (face) textures you use / like - it will work as supposed as these changes are model based and not dependant on any particular set of face / skin (cosmetics) textures.\r\n\r\nSkyrim have two categories of faces - Chargen faces and Bethesda supped-up ones. First are nice and easy on eye while second are, in my opinion, terrible - thus this mod which does away with quite a lot of them. \r\n\r\nTo install you need to navigate to your Steam/SteamApps/common/skyrim - game folder and paste / drag n drop in it my Data (mod) folder. Allow overwrite!    \r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t like this new look, simply delete / remove my .esp (plug-in) and original look will be restored to your game.\r\n\r\nBugs/conflicts: none known with my lot but keep in mind that game restores to in-game original if there is conflict (two or more changes of same character / id file).\r\n\r\nNote on v1.1: More NPC faces - both sexes.\r\n\r\nNote on v1.2: A lot of new additions including Bandits, Commoners, CW Soldiers and City Guards. Last ones will be real boon for users of mods like my Stormcloaks n Guards with Faces as their in-game faces leave a lot to be desired.\r\n\r\nNote on 1.3: Numerous new additions which now cover over 50% of all in game NPc\\'s. Game Housecarls - as before - out of practical necessity not included or affected!\r\n  \r\nUse:\r\nFree to use but if used for modding ask me for permission!\r\n\r\nEnjoy and try to remember - if you like it even in a part - to give endorsement! \r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for great game and to ElminsterAU for his TES5Edit.",
