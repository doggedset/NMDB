  "descriptionHtml": "This Mod Adds two new spells to the world of Skyrim: Demon Form and Demon Skin.\r\n\r\nThe spells and their effects are listed below:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDemon Form:\r\n\r\n-You Transform in to a Demon for a 5 min duration, giving the player a complete re-skin.\r\n-Your weapons and spells will be unequipped for the duration.\r\n-You will be unable to bring up your UI during the effect (same as with werewolf transform)\r\n-The player will be equipped with a new Bound BattleAxe which is a Voice equip spell, and two Destruction spells for your left hand and right hand.\r\n-During the effect, all NPCs become hostile.\r\n-During the effect, the player doesnâ€™t stack Bounty for his Crimes.\r\n-You will Grow..\r\n-You will take less damage proportional to your missing Health.\r\n-Your Voice Equip spell conjures a Demon BattleAxe.\r\n- Attacks with the BattleAxe are scripted to deal a portion of the damage as a percentage of the Target\\'s base Health. This portion will be returned to the player as Health and Stamina. (sort of a life-steal, but cooler)\r\n- Attacks with the BattleAxe are sweeping attacks.\r\n-Equipping the BattleAxe will grant the player a new Voice spell. When used, the player gets an attack speed and movement speed boost for 5 seconds. Additionally all surrounding enemies will be feared and damaged. Triggering this effect will Cost the Player 20% Health!\r\n-Your Right hand spell fires a flame projectile; On impact the projectile explodes dealing considerable damage in a small radius. Targets will be knocked back. A portion of the damage is a percentage of the Target\\'s base Health (so it can scale with level). Casting the spell will cost 20% health!\r\n-Casting the right hand spell will release a stream of fire in front of the player. Targets hit by the flame are slowed and damaged. Standing in the flames left on the scourged earth will Cauterize your wounds.\r\n-Fire Damage Done is increased proportionally with your missing health. ( under 20% you do 3x more fire damage)\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDemon Skin:\r\n-This spell is intended to be a great addition and option to any Fire Mage.\r\n-On cast, the spell will transform you into a demon for the 2 min duration.\r\n-You will keep your current size.\r\n-A fire cloak effect will be placed around the player, damaging surrounding hostile targets\r\n-The player will be able to use any spell or weapon from his inventory\r\n-You will take 20% damage from all sources.\r\n-Fire Damage Done is increased proportionally with your missing health. ( under 20% you do 3x more fire damage) -> you can do loads of damage when low on HP if you can risk fighting while vulnerable.\r\n\r\nYou can find the spell outside Whiterun near the Khajiit camp inside a chest.\r\n\r\n.Work in PROGRESS.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nINSTALL:\r\n\r\nExtract everything in your Data Folder. Enable from Data Files.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMy Other Mods:\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11495&tab=3&navtag=/modules/comments/comments_ajax.php?tid=587257|:|fid=11495\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12891&tab=3&navtag=/modules/comments/comments_ajax.php?tid=614567|:|fid=12891\r\n\r\n",
