  "summary": "This is my first mod, so don\\'t get mad at me because you think it\\'s awful. Just something small I made, It\\'s a unique Silver Sword called \\\"Sword of Vigilance\\\". It\\'s nothing special, no retexture, just a Silver Sword with better stats and an enchantment.",
  "descriptionHtml": " You can find it at Reachwind Eyrie, laying on a rock next to the conveniently placed blood patch and \r\nnoticeably dead Werewolf. Is it Lore-friendly? Yes, I suppose so. But you can make up it\\'s back story, make it seem mysterious.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATS\r\n\r\n\r\nA base damage of 15, Fire Damage for 25 points lasting for 4 seconds - this has a huge amount of charge so don\\'t worry about bringing soul gems with you. And it also have the Silver Sword\\'s ability to do extra damage to undead. This weapon is a bit OP, I\\'m just saying.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\n\r\nUse the Nexus Mod Manager, it\\'s just easier, ok?\r\n",
