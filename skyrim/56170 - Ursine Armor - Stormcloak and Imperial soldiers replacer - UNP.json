Anything else you can use freely as long as you credit my work in the comments&#34;\r<br />\r<br />And, of course, I credit all those authors for his awesome work:\r<br />\r<br />Armor meshes UNP Minidresses Collection by Tiwa44\r<br />&#34;Half&#34; Bra mesh Brokefoots UNP Mashup Compilation by brokefoot\r<br />Armlets and Barbarian Cloak meshes Ashara Princes of the Woods for UNP and male by SydneyB\r<br />Cuisse mesh UNP Undies by Petrovich\r<br />Underwear mesh Osare Underwear - UNP by anano\r<br />Collar mesh R18Pn Set - Inner Wear Set for UNP and CBBEV3 by NPR\r<br />\r<br />And how could it be otherwise, I credit nsp13 / Deserter X for his great mod that you need to have installed to have this one to work.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I use the HDT version, but I been unable to do it work with the NPCs (I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible) and for that purpose I&#39;ve included the meshes of the non HDT boots: if you use the non HDT version ignore the message to overwrite.",
