I understand that the cleaning process seems tedious and it would be nice to fire off the program to clean 200 plugins while you go do something else.  Unfortunately there are still no plans on adding an automated way to clean multiple plugins or access to TES5Edit from the command line.  Being there to see what errors might be reported during the cleaning process ensure that you are aware of potential issues that can lead to instability while playing Skyrim.\n<br />\n<br />Cleaning multiple plugins at once can and will lead to erroneous cleaning and can in many cases lead to unwanted crashes to the desktop.  Please look at the Cleaning Tutorial or watch the cleaning videos.  They show both loading the plugins you know are required or show only loading the one plugin and letting TES5Edit load any other dependencies.  After applying the filter for cleaning, clean only the one plugin.  It is imperative that the process is repeated for each individual separate plugin that you wish to clean.\n<br />\n<br />Currently cleaning a plugin involves indexing over a million references at times.  When only the required plugins are loaded then the cleaning is accurate.  If unnecessary plugins are involved those become part of the index and could cause the plugin to lose important and required data.  Without human intervention too many issues during the cleaning process would go unnoticed and make troubleshooting game issues related to plugins even more difficult then it already is.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00BFFF]Cleaning Plugins and official DLC when a new version of TES5Edit is released:[/color]\n<br />\n<br />It is not always necessary to clean all your plugins every time a new version of TES5Edit is released.  More often then not an ITM does not cause Skyrim to crash.  What can lead to crashes are deleted references which are resolved as part of the cleaning process when you choose \"Undelete and Disable References\".  It is still important to remove \"Identical to Master\" records for a more stable game but not as vital to eliminating crashes.  The other causes for crashes are corrupt plugins, poorly written and managed scripts, and missing files required by the plugin.  If Skyrim is working for you leave things the way they are.  It's not really required unless we make some major update in the cleaning process.  If you feel you must clean the official Bethesda ESM files then restore any backups you have.  However, it is much more reliable to use the Verify Cache feature from Steam.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00BFFF]Using TES5Edit in place of the CK:[/color]\n<br />\n<br />As TES5Edit becomes more widely used in the Skyrim community it has become a concern that many people still want to use the utility in place of the Construction Kit.  This is still not recommended.  We work hard to make TES5Edit as accurate as possible but development is directly related to the plugins themselves.  TES5Edit can not replicate all the changes that the CK will make.  Attack Data is the best example.  Merely checking or unchecking certain things for an NPC will alter the attack data dramatically.  We won't be adding those types of things to TES5Edit.\n<br />\n<br />Please understand that we don't directly support the use of TES5Edit to make major changes to plugins.  Aside from all the things the CK will change in a plugin that TES5Edit cannot replicate, Skyrim will react the same way to changes made to a Plugin with TES5Edit.  If you have questions about changes you are making to plugins or how Skyrim will react to your changes please direct all questions to the [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/forum/184-the-creation-kit/]Skyrim CK thread[/url].  All changes you could make in the CK are covered in the [url=http://www.creationkit.com/Main_Page]CK Wiki[/url] and therefore don't need to be covered in any TES5Edit documentation.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00BFFF]Merging Plugins:[/color]\n<br />\n<br />There is still a demand for merging multiple plugins but merging plugins is still unsupported by the TES5Edit team.  There is a [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37981]TES5Edit script by Matortheeternal[/url] for merging plugins.  Some mods cannot be successfully merged with it and you should direct all questions relating to the script to the author.  There is [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showtopic=1033740]a thread available[/url] where people have posted which plugins merge successfully or unsuccessfully.  For more info on ways to use TES5Edit to Merge Plugins check out [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/904953-how-to-merge-multiple-mods-with-multiple-master-files]How To Merge Multiple Mods With Multiple Master Files[/url] and [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1425724-merging-mods]Merging Mods[/url].  Otherwise if you intend on editing masses of entries, merging plugins, and creating compatibility patches for Skyrim overhauls please create your own separate thread.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00BFFF]Previous versions such as FO3Edit, FNVEdit, TES4Edit:[/color]\n<br />\n<br />We understand that sometimes updates to programs break things.  Please use the updates with caution.  However, please use them and then report issues so we can improve the program.  Our goal is to make all versions as bug free as possible and introduce new features that are useful for the modding community for all the Bethesda games this utility supports.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#00BFFF]TES5Edit Updates:[/color][/size]\n<br />With each new version you may want to restore plugins from backups and reclean them. Otherwise any fixes and updates to cleaning process won't take effect.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00BFFF]Version 3.2.1 contains the following changes:[/color]\n<br />\n<br />- [SSE/FO4] Creation Club support (ESL plugins), forced load order for plugins in *.ccc file\n<br />- [TE5/SSE] \"Generate as Objects\" LODGen option\n<br />- [FO3/FNV] LODGen Atlas options\n<br />- [FO4] FO4LODGen mode\n<br />- Skyrim VR and Fallout4 VR support: rename as TES5VREdit.exe or FO4VREdit.exe, or execute with -tes5vr or -fo4vr parameters\n<br />- filtering: if 8-digits hexadecimal FormID number is provided in \"Base Record EditorID contains\" field, then FormID will be checked instead\n<br />- multiselection in plugins window and similar ones, right click menu options apply to selection only\n<br />- \"Reset structure\" right click menu in the right view pane to add missing fields if any\n<br />- \"Compare selected\" right click menu in Referenced By tab when several records selected of the same type\n<br />- read (TES5|SSE)MapMarkers.txt and (TES5|SSE)QuestTypes.txt if present to replace game values with custom ones including new values\n<br />- improved record definitions\n<br />- various bug fixes and optimizations\n<br />- new scripts and scripting APIs to work with json, nifs, materials, lod files\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00BFFF]Version 3.2 contains the following changes:[/color]\n<br />\n<br />- [SSE] Skyrim Special Edition support\n<br />- [SSE] SSELODGen mode\n<br />- [FO4] Fallout 4 support\n<br />- improved record definitions and error checking\n<br />- various bug fixes and optimizations\n<br />- new scripts\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00BFFF]Version 3.1.3 contains the following changes:[/color]\n<br />\n<br />- [FO4] Fallout 4 support\n<br />- utf-8 support for translatable strings with -cp:utf-8 command line parameter\n<br />- \"Stick to\" right click menu in the right view pane\n<br />- improved record definitions\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00BFFF]Version 3.1.2 contains the following changes:[/color]\n<br />\n<br />- improved record definitions and error checking\n<br />- [TES5] LODGen support for glowing meshes\n<br />- [FO3/FNV] Fixed possible error when reading LOD meshes\n<br />- [TES5] TES5LODGen avoids generating trees LOD for duplicate FormID ref numbers, bug in Skyrim causes them to not switch off properly in the game\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00BFFF]Version 3.1.1 contains the following changes:[/color]\n<br />\n<br />- PBEA record type for FO3/FNV\n<br />- improved record definitions\n<br />- xLODGen fix reading BSA archives\n<br />- xLODGen impoved removing of mesh faces under landscape LOD\n<br />- FNVLODGen and FO3LODGen\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00BFFF]Version 3.1.0 contains the following changes:[/color]\n<br />\n<br />- speed optimizations\n<br />- fixed memory leaks\n<br />- fixed sorting of INFOs in DIAL\n<br />- fixed float values rounding\n<br />- advanced ModGroups feature\n<br />- drag&amp;drop and \"Remove from selected records\" support for individual flags\n<br />- fonts are changeable in Options\n<br />- new scripting functions\n<br />- new script auto execution mode with -script:\"test.pas\" switch or when renamed to (TES4|TES5|FO3|FNV)Script.exe\n<br />- xEdit associates itself with *.tes5pas, *.tes4pas, *.fo3pas and *.fnvpas extensions\n<br />- load Mod Organizer profile internally using command line parameter -moprofile:&lt;profilename&gt;\n<br />- faster -quickshowconflicts switch processing\n<br />- new -O: parameter to set the output folder for TES4LODGen generation (much faster), for example \"-O:..&#92;ModOrganizer&#92;mods&#92;Generated DistantLOD\"\n<br />- [FO3/FNV] Optional hiding of templated actor fields\n<br />- [FNV] Don't undelete refs of TREEs with LOD, bug in the game engine causes a crash\n<br />- [TES5] TES5LODGen, in right click menu -&gt;
