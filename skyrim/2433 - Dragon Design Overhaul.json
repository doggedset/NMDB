  "summary": "Markings redesign to make dragons recognizable from afar, with a bit of color.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A texture set that replaces the default Dragon, Blood Dragon, Frost Dragon and Elder Dragon. Alduin, Odahviing and the Ancient Dragon are untouched as they\\'re already pretty distinguishable, especially with this set in place.\r\nThe dragons each have a very distinct color in their new patterns. I\\'ve tried to balance these markings between bright and rewardingly vibrant up close, yet not a splot of color on the landscape that sticks out like a sore thumb. Color is primarily on the top of the wings and muted on the underside, as this both mimics naturally vibrant animals and again mutes the color a bit to brief and unintrusive but instantly informational flashes while the dragon is in the distance.\r\nBlood dragon\\'s fins have been corrected during the recolor.",
