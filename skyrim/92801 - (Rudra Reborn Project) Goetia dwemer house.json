  "modName": "(Rudra Reborn Project) Goetia dwemer house",
  "summary": "A simple house mod addon for the mod World of Rudra. It adds some lore and a couple of buildings more that are supposed to make the desert feel more alive",
  "descriptionHtml": "[u][b][size=3]Description[/size][/b][/u]\n<br />This mod contains a player house safe for storage with custom alchemy and enchanting table, lots of different containers to store your loot, a new usable sword, a real life painting I made myself, everything spiced with some background story of the house and of the previous owner. It also adds a bridge that connects Akko city and Lucast. \n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]To find the house head to Akko city and find Limry house (one of the houses with a shiny blue mark), you will find the key to Goetia Entrance a little hidden in the room. When you have it go past Lucast, you will notice the house marker on the map.\n<br />[/list] \n<br /> \n<br />[u][b][size=3]Requirements[/size][/b][/u]\n<br />Skyrim (Oldrim) and the latest version of World of Rudra (1.75), no dlc required so far but it may change with further content being added. I will try to keep it simple though.\n<br />It is REALLY important, to enjoy the mod at its fullest, to update the LOD with any mod capable of doing it.\n<br /> \n<br />[u][b][size=3]C[/size][/b][/u][u][b][size=3]redits[/size][/b]\n<br />[/u]First of all thanks to the original creator of World of Rudra Bee9999, his mod is amazing and I'm more than happy helping making it an even better experience. \n<br />Thanks to Leadpipejustice for sharing this initiative with me and supporting me. Thanks to Darkfox127 for his tutorials for dummy modders, which I am.\n<br />Thanks to these authors for letting everyone use their resources, without them I would have a more shallow looking house:\n<br />- Tamira\n<br />- Badgremlin\n<br />- Elianora\n<br />- AARS\n<br />- Insanity\n<br />- Jokerine\n<br />- Oaristys\n<br />- Stroti\n<br />- The_Funktasm\n<br />- Lolicept\n<br />- Artisanix\n<br />- Phitt\n<br />- youarenotsupposedtobeinhere\n<br />- Sulya Tamagen\n<br />- Urwy\n<br />- Garnet\n<br />- 1ndajone5\n<br />And last but not least Bethesda for Skyrim and the Creation Kit. \n<br />Please if I forgot someone tell me",
