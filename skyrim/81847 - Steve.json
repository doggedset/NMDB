  "descriptionHtml": "It just puts 4 copies of an NPC named Steve on a road above Falkreath. When you talk to Steve you can start some small talk about the weather. Steve will then, with the literal roar of a bear, challenge you to a fight. As an unintended side-effect, every NPC now has the exact same dialogue option as Steve. Uh, have fun?\r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod (sortof) I just messed around in the creation kit for a few minutes and this is the result. You probably don&#39;t want to download this if you can&#39;t remove it. It will probably fuck up your game, I honestly don&#39;t know.\r<br />\r<br />https://youtu.be/rAI2cFKYIhE\r<br />A mod showcase.",
