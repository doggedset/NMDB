  "descriptionHtml": "Since FNV we\\'ve had to use the launcher to play the game, this mod or well file is a simple text file named \\\"steam_appid.txt\\\" which contains Skyrim\\'s AppID 72850 once placed inside Skyrim\\'s folder TESV.exe can be launched directly and no more using the launcher to play the game, yay! :D\r\n\r\nYou can simply open up Notepad and create a \\\"steam_appid.txt\\\" containing the number 72850, or just download the zip I\\'ve included and extract the TXT file and put it beside TESV.exe,\r\nrefer to screenshot if confused.\r\n\r\nThis has worked for me on both games, enjoy!",
