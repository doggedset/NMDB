  "summary": "Changes the magic charging sound to better judge spell casting",
  "descriptionHtml": "A problem I&#39;ve always had was I had trouble telling when to let go of the button to cast a spell. So I tried mods that did away with the magic charge time, which worked, but made magic overpowered. By a lot. But then I realized that a more simple fix would be to replace the sound it makes.\r<br />\r<br />It only takes about 0.5 sec to actually charge a spell, but the sound for charging is about 3 sec. So unless you are staring at your mana bar, it&#39;s so hard to tell when it&#39;s ok to let go. And if you are like me, you end up holding it until you HEAR it stop charging.\r<br />\r<br />This mod replaces the charging sounds to better match when it&#39;s ok to actually cast it.\r<br />A simple but effective fix. For myself, it makes playing a mage a whole lot more fun.\r<br />\r<br />Preview. The first half is vanilla and the second half is my mod.\r<br />[youtube]qH6mwMxIVyY[/youtube]",
