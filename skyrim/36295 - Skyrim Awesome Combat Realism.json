  "descriptionHtml": "Lightweight mod that adds a great deal of unpredictable and more realistic combat. Not designed to be a simulator like Duke Patricks Heavy weapons mod but one that you can put in almost any heavily modded game or vanilla and will still function okay just need to put load order after all others, however I will say I have heavily edited the GSM values so it might break a lot of your mods. Best to use this mod on a game that is only lightly or cosmetically modded.  ",
