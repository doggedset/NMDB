  "descriptionHtml": "[b][color=#00FFFF]Update v3[/color][/b]\r\nThis update removes a few more lines of dialogue (Taarie and Endarie who work at Radiant Raiments in Solitude, and Nelkir the annoying child in Dragonsreach). I\\'ve updated the mod description to include the newly removed dialogue.\r\n\r\n[b][color=#00FFFF]Update v2[/color][/b]\r\nThis update removes a few more lines of dialogue. I\\'ve also separated the dialogue into two separate ESP files: one for guards (STFU - guards.esp) and one for everyone else (STFU.esp). You can choose to use both or just one. I\\'ve updated the mod description to include the newly removed dialogue.\r\n\r\n[b][color=#00FFFF]Description[/color][/b]\r\nThis mod simply gets rid of all the annoying NPC dialogue that you\\'ve been tired of hearing over and over again. It mostly affects NPCs in Whiterun, but there are a few others for Markarth and Solitude. This mod includes two separate ESP files: one for guards (STFU - guards.esp) and one for everyone else (STFU.esp). You can choose to use both or just one. Let me know if there are NPCs in other cities that you want to STFU.\r\n\r\n[b][color=#00FFFF]Removes the following:[/color][/b]\r\n\\\"Come to Dragonsreach to discuss the ongoing hostilities, like the rest of the \\'great warriors?\\'\\\" - Farengar\r\n\\\"You know, if you\\'ve got the aptitude, you should join the Mages College in Winterhold.\\\" - Farengar\r\n\\\"Do come back.\\\" - Belethor\r\n\\\"Do you get to the Cloud District very often?

He\\'s the steward, up at Dragaonsreach.\\\" - Adrianne Avenicci\r\n\\\"You know what\\'s wrong with Skyrim these days? Everyone is obsessed with death.\\\" - Jon Battle-Born\r\n\\\"What are you lookin\\' at? I\\'m not afraid of you, ya know. Even if you are my elder.\\\" - Braith\r\n\\\"Boys, girls, dogs, elders - there\\'s nobody I won\\'t fight!\\\" - Braith\r\n\\\"Gods be praised!\\\" - Eorlund Gray-Mane\r\n\\\"Oh, I\\'m just a servant, dear. You want to talk to one of the Companions, I\\'m sure.\\\" - Tilma\r\n\\\"I\\'ve been tending to the warriors of Jorrvaskr for as long as I can remember.\\\" - Tilma\r\n\\\"Come to chat with an old woman, hmmm? Do your good deed for the day?\\\" - Lillith MaidenLoom\r\n\\\"I\\'m Ghorza\\'s assistant. I help her with the forge.\\\" - Tacitus Sallustius (Markarth)\r\n\\\"I have things to study. What is it?\\\" - Calcelmo (Markarth)\r\n\\\"Hmmm? Sorry, I was lost in thought. I\\'m planning my wedding, you see. So many details to work out.\\\" - Vittoria Vici (Solitude)\r\n\\\"I really need to get back to planning my wedding.\\\" - Vittoria Vici (Solitude)\r\n\\\"If you\\'re heading to the Blue Palace, you might want to rethink that outfit.\\\" - Taarie (Solitude)\r\n\\\"If you ever want to replace those old rags, stop by Radiant Raiment.\\\" - Taarie (Solitude)\r\n\\\"I can help with purchases, but if you came to talk, see my sister. She\\'s the one who gets on with people. It\\'s her one virtue, really.\\\" - Endarie (Solitude)\r\n\\\"Another wanderer, here to lick my father\\'s boots. Good job.\\\" - Nelkir\r\n\\\"Trinkets, odds and ends, that sort of thing.\\\" - various\r\n\\\"Some may call this junk. Me, I call them treasures.\\\" - various\r\n\\\"Hmph. I had you figured for a mage. I think you\\'ll appreciate this...\\\" - various\r\n\\\"You\\'re not as dumb as you look.\\\" - various\r\n\\\"I should bash your face in after all you\\'ve done.\\\" - various\r\n\\\"That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance.\\\" - various\r\n\\\"That spell looks dangerous...\\\" - various\r\n\\\"Dear, that spell is making me nervous.\\\" - various\r\n\\\"Keep your distance.\\\" - various\r\n\\\"Got to thinking, maybe I\\'m the Dragonborn, and I just don\\'t know it yet.\\\" - guards\r\n\\\"Now I remember - you\\'re that new member of the Companions. So you, what - fetch the mead?\\\" - guards\r\n\\\"Is that... fur? Coming out of your ears?\\\" - guards\r\n\\\"So you can cast a few spells. Am I supposed to be impressed?\\\" - guards\r\n\\\"Hey, you mix potions, right? Can you brew me an ale?\\\" - guards\r\n\\\"Hands to yourself, sneak thief.\\\" - guards\r\n\\\"I find your hand in my pocket, I\\'m going to cut it off.\\\" - guards\r\n\\\"I know your kind, always sneaking about.\\\" - guards\r\n\\\"Go fiddling with any locks around here, we\\'re going to have a real problem.\\\" - guards\r\n\\\"Hail, summoner. Conjure me up a warm bed, would you?\\\" - guards\r\n\\\"Let me guess - someone stole your sweetroll...\\\" - guards\r\n\\\"I used to be an adventurer like you. Then I took an arrow in the knee...\\\" - guards\r\n\\\"Wait, I know you...\\\" - guards\r\n\r\n[b][color=#00FFFF]Why didn\\'t you shut up Heimskr?![/color][/b]\r\nAs the most annoying NPC in the game, that man deserves to die. If I shut him up, you\\'d just ignore him and let him live. No, the only way to shut him up is to kill him.",
