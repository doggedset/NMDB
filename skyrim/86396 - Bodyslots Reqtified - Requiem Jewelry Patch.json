  "summary": "Ever got tired of a dire need to see your baubles/jewelry in your first person view while playing Requiem? Have you ever forgot to save your little patch you made specifically for this bodyslot issue? Then this patch is for you.",
  "descriptionHtml": "You always want to play Requiem if you&#39;re like me - to avoid all these... casualties... on the morrowind-styled gameplay. And you always want to make your experience the best you can, be it textures or realism mods. But when it comes to jewelry, you always had to suffer this basic lack of immersive visuals for your left hand rings now, did you? Well, in this case here&#39;s what you want.\r<br />\r<br />Simply put, I allowed myself to browse around the net to find [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68776/?]this beautiful patch[/url] for the same issue but for vanilla experience, and to merge bodyslot changes done alike into a patch w/Requiem entries taken into consideration to avoid having your Requiem-related racial features reset.\r<br />\r<br />This patch was done for Requiem 1.9.4.1. This patch requires base game, Dawnguard DLC and Requiem.\r<br />[size=1](The reason why Dawnguard is required is that I added bodyslots to dawnguard races as well, being unsure it&#39;s unplayable.)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />I made this patch for myself to use with Immersive Jewelry and I can&#39;t say I have noticed any issues during my playtesting with this patch, but make sure you give me some feedback if you manage to find an issue, folks.\r<br />\r<br />[size=1](The thing is, the mount data for argonians and/or something *kind of minor* wasn&#39;t available for merging into this patch via TES5Edit for some reason, be it me or the software itself; thus I can&#39;t assure you this will work as well as it worked for me, but I&#39;d be grateful if you&#39;d actually let me know it does not render your game unplayable or anything of sorts.)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Special thanks to [u]Requem Dungeon Masters[/u] for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281/?]their mod[/url] respectively. You are the best.\r<br />Special thanks also goes to [u]GameFever[/u] for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68776/?]his beautiful patch[/url] I mentioned earlier. Wouldn&#39;t have been possible for me to do it without your implementation.[/b]",
