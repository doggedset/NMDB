If you have a request, post it like everyone else at the Nexusforum. And also, don&#39;t bother me to change something in this mod, because I don&#39;t know how (else, I wouldn&#39;t had to ask someone to do it for me ^^).[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]It will give you a configurable Amount of Gold for every Main- and Normalquest, you complete. It does not differ between normal Quests and Mainquests and will not award Misc-Quests, which are listet under Various in your Questjournal (for example Bountyquests etc.)\r<br />\r<br />The Amount can be changed ingame by Consolecommand: Open the console and type \r<br />[/size][size=3][size=2][size=3]&#34;set ax_GoldperQuest to X&#34; (without &#34; &#34;) \r<br />where X is your desired amount.[/size]\r<br />[size=3]Standardly it is set to 2000 Gold.[/size]\r<br />[u]\r<br />[size=3]This Mod needs [url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE[/url][/size][/u]\r<br />\r<br />This Mod is Compatible with everything, because it edits nothing in the game, it just adds some new records.
