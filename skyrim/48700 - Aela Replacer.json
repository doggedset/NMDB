  "summary": "My personal vision of Aela.  Thought I&#39;d share it with everyone.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I always thought it was a bit odd that Aela is &#34;the Huntress&#34;, yet she has somewhat paler skin compare to all the other Hunters/poachers in Skyrim.  I started this mod to give her the bronze goddess skin tone to better match the other NPCs, but after tooling around with her other features, I ended up making a full on makeover.\r<br />\r<br />I made her quieter for stealth purposes, and she shouldn&#39;t trigger pressure plate traps.  She has a few marksman perks, but nothing too powerful.  Nothing else was changed aside from her looks.  If you like it please endorse.\r<br />\r<br />**Note**  There&#39;s a small bug right after you complete the rite and wake up naked outside the Silver Hand compound.  Aela&#39;s face is discolored, probably due to her turning into a werewolf.  To fix this, save your game and exit Skyrim.  In your mods loadout, just uncheck then recheck the Aela .esp and load your save.  This should fix the problem.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />ApachiiSkyHair - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?\r<br />The Eyes of Beauty - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722\r<br />\r<br />Recommended: (to look like the screenshots)\r<br />CBBE female body replacer - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666\r<br />Better females by Bella - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2812 (no makeup version)\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Use NMM or simply drop the .esp and the .bsa files into the Data folder. It&#39;s that simple.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />Use NMM or simply delete the .esp and the .bsa files from the Data folder. It&#39;s that simple.\r<br />\r<br />Conflicts:\r<br />If you&#39;re using UFO (Ultimate Follower Overhaul - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14037), make sure this mod is loaded AFTER UFO, or you&#39;ll get the discolored vanilla head bug. It may just be doing this on my machine, but I don&#39;t have the slightest idea why it happens.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to the Nexus modding community, you guys make it possible to enjoy playing the same games over and over and over...\r<br />\r<br />Special Thanks to FalmerBane.  After using many of his beautifully done replacers, it inspired me to make some of my own.",
