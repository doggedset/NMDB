Starting with Dragons Bridge with is now the \\\"Windy Village\\\". You will hear various custom wind sounds and flags blowing in the wind. The area has also been fully remastered from the ground up, from plants to rocks, you name it.\r\n\r\nAs for Mixwater Mill, i found it horrible that the devs placed tons of misplaced flora around that area so i added and removed and aswell as fixed various parts of the place but still keeping the feel of the place in hand as described in books and lore, This includes Dragons Bridge.\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s1321.photobucket.com/user/bradley_kefford1/media/Feat_zps4d95b2d9.png.html][IMG]http://i1321.photobucket.com/albums/u556/bradley_kefford1/Feat_zps4d95b2d9.png[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\n-Fully custom Wind sounds\r\n-Fully remastered areas named\r\n-untouched navmesh for perfect gameplay\r\n-No performance hit due to optimization\r\n-Major lore friendly\r\n\r\n-Npc\\'s use new objects and react to the new items and flora added.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing/downloading. And dont forget to endorse :).\r\n\r\n",
