  "descriptionHtml": "[b][i][u]               [size=4]   Warning This mod is for people who don&#39;t mind losing a few citizens [/size]\r<br />[/u][/i][/b]   Undead invaders have begun an onslaught across skyrim and all her holds. Will the undead invaders conquer the nords motherland or will the nords fend off there home from these undead creatures. Only with your help can they defeat these creatures attacking their cities. \r<br />   This mod adds two new undead enemies to the game the first is the[b][size=3] DeathLord[/size][/b] a giant drauger sent from the depths of hell to cause chaos. This monster has lots of health and towers over the player. To accompany this ruthless killer is the [b][size=3]Minion[/size][/b] as their called. They are smaller then the player and move quicker with less health. The Deathlord and minions usually attack in groups of 1:5. They attack a city after you enter and they will attack anything but each other.\r<br />   They attack all holds and most cities within the hold. They attack citizens, guards, livestock. \r<br />I do plan on furthering this mod. Adding a quest and new undead creatures to fight.",
