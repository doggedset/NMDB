  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Awesome &#34;ad-like&#34; description[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Back again with yet another amateur-level, pseudo-stupid, useless to 99.99% of the people still playing Skyrim. Last time i gave warriors the ability to swing many more times per minute, today im giving the conjurers, summoners, and general atronach lovers something they can use to overrun their enemies with Dremoras and else. I present you, the Summoning Techniques mod&#33; Only 0.0001% more useless then my last mod&#33; Could this be as bad as it gets? I wouldn&#39;t bet on it&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]REAL description[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Getting serious tho, this ring will grant you access to a custom enchantment called &#34;Summoning Techniques&#34;, wich basically allows you to summon two more creatures. Usefull for Conjuration based characters as they don&#39;t get much love (probobly for being one of the less common builds ever).\r<br />\r<br />[b]Ring Location\r<br />\r<br />[/b]If something im keeping between my past mod and this one, thats my love for puzzles, so to find the ring you will need to solve this:\r<br />\r<br />[i]In a place powerfull long ago, yet forgotten today\r<br />Lies a sanctuary of knowledge and power, yet disliked\r<br />Deep within, find the master of Oblivion, who gladly shares his knowledge\r<br />Next to his dreams, retrieve the ring and learn its secrets\r<br />\r<br />[/i]Hope you like it, and quotting Gopher, &#34;As always, have fun&#33;&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Note: In the files section you can get a text file explaining where to find the ring.",
