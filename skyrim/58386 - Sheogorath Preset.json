  "summary": "This is a simple mod that adds Sheogorath as a playable preset.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod and it is a rather simple mod and easy to do yourself. But I noticed there were none here on Nexus and I know that many don&#39;t want to mess around with the Creation Kit. It simply adds one extra preset to the Male Breton race. This preset is of Sheogorath who is a Male Breton in the game. The new Sheogorath preset should be the very last preset available on the Breton Male race. This should be compatible with any other mods as it only uses the base Skyrim game and no other mods. This mod does not add anything else to the game. If you want to roleplay as Sheogorath you will have to add his items via the console or by using a different mod.\r<br />\r<br />To install simply download the file and extract the ESP file into the Skyrim/Data folder. Then enable the mod either through NMM or the Skyrim Launcher.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33;",
