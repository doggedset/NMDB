INFORMATION ON THE MOD           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   When you walk down the road past Fort Greymoor to the west of Whiterun, a thief robs \r\nyou and takes all your stuff.  You will have to chase him into the fort if you want your things \r\nback.\r\n\r\n\t   It might be sort of hard to retrieve your gear, since the thief now has all your \r\nweapons, armor, potions, and scrolls.  He has probably equipped some of your armor and weapons\r\nby now too.\r\n\r\n\t   To make it worse, he is level 35, and hangs around with a trio of high-level bandits.\r\n\r\n\t   But looking at the bright side of things, he didn\\'t kill you.  And the weather is \r\nnot too bad.  It isn\\'t even snowing on your bare skin. \t   \t    \r\n************************************************************************\r\n2. Installation                           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n           Extract (decompress) the .esp and the .bsa to your Skyrim directory.  \r\n(It will be something like *Installation directory*\\\\Skyrim\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data)\r\nMark the box next to \\\"You Get Robbed.esp\\\" in your mod manager.\r\n \r\n           Alternately, extract files someplace else.  Then move the .esp and .bsa \r\nto Skyrim\\\\Data.  Mark the box next to the plugin in your mod manager.\r\n************************************************************************\r\n3. Version History    \r\n************************************************************************\r\nV 1.0    6/25/12   Initial release.   \r\n************************************************************************\r\n4. Conflicts, Known Issues, and Troubleshooting\r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   Many gamers do not enjoy being robbed, losing all their gear, and running around \r\nbarefoot.  This mod may not appeal to them.  But I must state in advance that we will not build\r\nany patches for this mod to make it so you don\\'t get robbed, lose all your gear, and run around \r\nbarefoot.  The mod would lose its reason for being if we did that.\r\n\r\n\t   This mod will be easier for high-level characters than low-level characters.  Easier \r\nfor mages than for other classes.  Easier for those with companions than for those without.\r\n\r\n\t   This mod does not look quite as good during games when you have joined a civil war \r\nfaction.\r\n\r\n\t   This mod could do with some more play-testing.\r\n\r\n\t   If you locate a bug, contact David Brasher on TES Nexus so that the situation can be\r\nexamined and can hopefully be fixed. \r\n************************************************************************\r\n5.
