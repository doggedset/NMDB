  "summary": "Fur bikini for CBBE, and layers for the vanilla femalebody_1 textures.",
  "descriptionHtml": "By request, and with Caliente\\'s permission,  I\\'ve added a CBBE version.  The bikini is not an equippable item, but rather part of the skin texture, and is intended to be used as savage-looking underwear for revealing armor.\r\n\r\nSince CBBE has a nice standard texture, the CBBE version is ready-to-use (as opposed to the vanilla version, which is a modder\\'s resource).  This is a mod of the CBBE textures by Caliente and requires CBBE v3, which you can get here:\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666/?\r\n\r\n*******************************************************\r\n\r\nI figured I\\'d post this, though it\\'s a bit of work to add it to the game. It\\'s also not super great, the straps in particular are a bit sloppy...if anyone wants to improve on it, be my guest.\r\n\r\nThis is a heavy plate armor mod.  Just kidding, it isn\\'t an armor or clothing mod at all, it\\'s part of the skin texture.  My armor mods aren\\'t really intended to have NOTHING underneath them...just very little.  This is what I use myself.\r\n\r\nSo far no one has released independent meshes for underwear (as far as I know)...so I\\'ve done it with with textures, and it will be a bit of work to edit whatever skin textures you\\'re using. I\\'ve provided photoshop files with layers that you can put over those. So, you would have to use Photoshop or GIMP with a plugin for dds files to add them.\r\n\r\nThe location of the files that these go with (assuming you\\'re using a skin texture mod) is:\r\n\r\nSteam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\female\r\n\r\nNote that, on the msn file, the layers use various blending modes. The easiest way to copy them to your main msn file with the modes intact is: in photoshop, open both the underwear layer file and your main dds file; select the layer you want to copy, and then in the layers palette, click the triangle for the flyout menu and click \\'Duplicate Layer...\\' A window pops up; in the Destination section, pick your dds file from the dropdown list. (Not sure about GIMP, hopefully it\\'s something similar.)\r\n\r\nThere are a couple reasons why I\\'m not just providing a skin texture with these already added. First, I myself use other people\\'s skin texture mods, which I don\\'t have permission to alter or redistribute. Second, even if I did, you quite likely may be using a different one than I am, so getting mine wouldn\\'t be very useful to you anyway.\r\n\r\nBut, if any skin texture mod authors want to offer a version of their mod with this added, feel free.  Or better yet, make this less sloppy and then add it to your mod! XD",
