  "descriptionHtml": "You can have any NPC as your favorite follower using console. \r\nNot finding any good description yet, allow me to add one - actually its very simple:\r\n\r\nNote: \r\n- this works for any NPC that enters conversation with you!\r\n   --> Using it with Sylgia long term and its working flawless.\r\n   --> Also tested with a random hunter (e.g. \\\"placeatme 73FBE\\\") and it works perfect.\r\n- Does not work with NPC\\'s that never open conversation dialogues (e.g.\\\"placeatme 45802\\\")\r\n\r\nYou can do anything you can do with any other follower, including managing their inventory!\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\nMaking NPC a follower:\r\n-----------------------------\r\n1) open console (^-key)\r\n2) click target NPC with mouse (Note the NPC-ID highlighted!)\r\n3) type \\\"addfac 5C84D 1\\\"\r\n    ... if you want to marry too, use \\\"addfac 19809 1\\\" in addition - Sideeffects might occure though.\r\n    (Note: I married Sylgia before making her follower, thus marriage via console is not tested) \r\n4) type \\\"Setrelationshiprank <NPC-ID> 4\\\"\r\n5) type \\\"Player.sertrelationshiprank <NPC-ID> 4\\\"\r\n\r\n... now the npc can already be recruited, though the behavior might not be ideal for adventuring.\r\nYou may turn your favorite NPC into a born adventurer though:\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\nNPC behavior:  NIGHTBLADE (thief/caster)\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\n- setclass 1317c (Nightblade)\r\n- addspell 7d98f (firebolt, one handed)\r\n- addspell 40000 (icebolt, one handed)\r\n- addspell 7231c (healing, one handed)\r\n- setav magicka 35 (more NPC casts too much, less hardly ever)\r\n- setlevel <your-level> (make them similar strength to yourself not to unbalance the game)\r\n- setav health <5xlevel>  (make them similar strength to yourself not to unbalance the game)\r\n- setav stamina <5xLevel> (make them similar strength to yourself not to unbalance the game)\r\n- setav onehanded 60\r\n- setav lightarmor 100 (don\\'t want them to die too easy)\r\n- setav sneaking 100 (don\\'t want them seen unless you are)\r\n- setav lockpicking 50\r\n- setav destruction 100 (no worries, the spells given are weak enough)\r\n- setav restoration 80\r\n- setav agression 1\r\n- setav confidence 3\r\n\r\nThe character will sneak when you do and only attack when you are, or if hit.\r\nYou can equip them with items in the game on your own. I\\'d recommend one-handed weapon and light armor.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\nNPC behavior:  WARRIOR\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\n- setclass 13176 (Warrior)\r\n- setav magicka 0 (not a spellcaster)\r\n- setlevel <your-level> (make them similar strength to yourself not to unbalance the game)\r\n- setav health <10xlevel>  (make them similar strength to yourself not to unbalance the game)\r\n- setav stamina <5xLevel> (make them similar strength to yourself not to unbalance the game)\r\n- setav onehanded 80\r\n- setav twohanded 80\r\n- setav marksman 50\r\n- setav lightarmor 60\r\n- setav heavyarmor 100 (don\\'t want them to die easy)\r\n- setav block 100 (don\\'t want them to die easy)\r\n- setav agression 3\r\n- setav confidence 4\r\n\r\nNo doubt you want to equip the NPC with the best armor and weapons you have, but this can be done in game without any further console commands.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\nNPC behavior:  MAGE\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\n- setclass 1317a (Mage)\r\n- addspell 2dd29 (lightning bolt)\r\n- addspell 12fd0 (Firebolt)\r\n- addspell 10f7ec (Ice Spear)\r\n- addspell b62ee (Healing)\r\n- addspell 4deea (Fear)\r\n- setlevel <your-level> (make them similar strength to yourself not to unbalance the game)\r\n- setav health <5xlevel>  (make them similar strength to yourself not to unbalance the game)\r\n- setav magicka <10xlevel> (make them similar strength to yourself not to unbalance the game)\r\n- setav stamina <5xLevel> (make them similar strength to yourself not to unbalance the game)\r\n- setav onehanded 60\r\n- setav sneaking 80 (not to have them start all the fights on their own)\r\n- setav destruction 100 (no worries, the spells given are weak enough)\r\n- setav restoration 80\r\n- setav agression 1\r\n- setav confidence 2\r\n\r\nIn case they are overdressed (e.g. armor) you can use \\\"showinventory\\\" on them and then do a \\\"removeitem <itemid> 1\\\" for anything you don\\'t want them to wear. Afterwards you can equip them normaly in game, also with standard clothing.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\nNPC behavior:  Ranger\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\n- setclass 13181 (Ranger)\r\n- setav magicka 0 (not a spellcaster)\r\n- setlevel <your-level> (make them similar strength to yourself not to unbalance the game)\r\n- setav health <5xlevel>  (make them similar strength to yourself not to unbalance the game)\r\n- setav stamina <10xLevel> (make them similar strength to yourself not to unbalance the game)\r\n- setav marksman 80 \r\n- setav onehanded 60\r\n- setav lightarmor 100 (don\\'t want them to die too easy)\r\n- setav sneaking 80\r\n- setav agression 1\r\n- setav confidence 2\r\n\r\nNo doubt you want to equip the NPC with the best bows and best light armor you have, but this can be done in game without any further console commands.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\nLast minute findings:\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\nthere\\'s been requests to rename characters. This is possible only in a very limited way, as only predefined messages work. (Also it does not work for all NPc. May be an issue with quest NPC)\r\nIf you want to try, these choices are known to me:\r\n\\\"SetActorFullName 4C72A\\\"  --> the Slayer\r\n\\\"SetActorFullName 52B5D\\\"  --> Stolen\r\n\\\"SetActorFullName 4AFD4\\\" -->  Disaffected\r\n\\\"SetActorFullName 4F82A\\\" -->  Jarl\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\nFinal Notes:\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\nIt always worked perfectly fine for me as described above. I could imagine that in rare situations (special NPCs chosen) the AI might not update proper; if you ever encounter such a case, please let me know. Usually opening console, targeting NPC and typing \\\"disable\\\" followed by \\\"enable\\\" should fix such problems though.\r\n\r\nAs a final advice though, I\\'d recommend not to choose essential characters, as scripted quests events might potentially mess them up. In general though, anyone you can kill should be a viable choice, at least once their quests are done.\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\n",
