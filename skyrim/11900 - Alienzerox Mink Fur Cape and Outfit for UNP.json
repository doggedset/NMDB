  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=3][b]Alienzerox Sage Fur Outfit for UNP[/b][/size][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI got permission from backsteppo to release my variant of the dq3 sage outfit, this is a retex/rebuild --- what I did was make it a light armor craftable at the tanning rack so there is no skill needed, so there is no advance in skill --- what I was really looking for was a cloak that I could make into fur because someone put that idea into my head and it wouldn\\'t go away until I actually found something that I could use ... I\\'m not very good at making usable meshes ... so I \\\"borrow with permission\\\" when I need to --- this project would have ended at just the cloak but I wanted to see if I would be able to furry-rize the outfit as well so this is was I ended up with.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it ... I\\'m learning more each time I create something ... this would be #6\r\n\r\n[b]Required Mods: You will need both of these mods for this one to work ... you don\\'t necessarily need to play as an Ashen but you do need the RaceCompatibility.esm to be active or you will crash ... the original DQ3 Sage Outfit was built for the UNP Body so you will need that also.  \r\n\r\n[size=3][color=red] -- [url=http:http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8583]The Ashen - Oriental Beauty Race[/url]\r\n\r\n -- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6709]DIMONIZED UNP female body[/url][/color][/size][/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n========================================================================================================================================\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions just drop data folder into your main game directory it should not override anything then just activate the esp in NM.",
