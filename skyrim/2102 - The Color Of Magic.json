  "descriptionHtml": "i dont think that someone powerful enough to talk smack to a dragon and get away with it would cast the same kind of fire spells as everyone else, if its magical fire shouldnt it look magical? if your really really really really evil wouldnt baptising your foes in black flame be more fitting?\r\n\r\nI will be adding more colors to this soon, i just wanted to get this up as it was requested, i will take requests as long as they are reasonable. any ideas or problems please let me know. this is the 1st mod ive ever shared with anyone, and my 1st upload on the nexus ever. hope you guys enjoy and creative criticism is welcome as well as any knowledge any of you may have to offer. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nI uploaded dark fire as my substitute for black fire for the time being, still running into issues, cant seem to change the color of the base fire in spells such as fire wall. ill either get the base to change or just the spell and burn off to change.
