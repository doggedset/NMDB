  "descriptionHtml": "Bingles Colorful Armory:\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.1 :\r\nFinished all the helmets. Tweaked them to work with the Beastly races (Orc, Argonian, Khajit.)\r\n\r\nHere\\'s some custom textures I put together for myself. I was a little dissapointed the citizens of Skyrim have never heard of paint before...\r\n\r\nI chose five color schemes, and named them accordingly:\r\nInfernal : Typically red with gold gilding.\r\nMystic : Typically Black with Silver Gilding.\r\nRegal: Typically black with Gold Gilding.\r\nShadow : Typically blue and black\r\nWild : Typically Green with gold gilding.\r\n\r\nThese textures have been made for the following armors:\r\nDaedric, DragonBone, DragonScale, Dwarven, Ebony, Elven, Glass, Orcish and Nordplate.\r\n\r\nThe Cuirasses are made from my \\\"Buff\\\" armor Meshes, with an alternative \\\"Half\\\" variety availible as well. The Armors have both male and female versions.\r\n\r\nThe Armors can all be made at the forge with the typical ingredients for the vanilla equivalent.\r\n\r\nThis mod is not finished. I have not finished all the Helmets and I haven\\'t yet started on the shields. Also, I would like a final version where the different sets come with a special bonus, hence the odd naming scheme I chose.\r\n\r\nTo install, just drop the contents of the data folder into your skyrim data folder. This mod is fully compatible with my \\\"Buff Armors\\\" mod.\r\n\r\nI have no current plans to release these as seperate files. But I may change my mind if asked nicely. Just remember: this mod is filled with hundreds of edited files and took probably more than a hundred hours to make. Forgive me If I take a little break from this.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nBethesda, for creating the best game I\\'ve played in a long time and filling it with great armors to mod.\r\nNifskope, for making all this possible.\r\nFOMM and Blender: These tools are essential for modding, and free, so kudos to their developers.\r\nGIMP: because I\\'m too cheap to buy photoshop.\r\nThe Nexus Forums: For occasionally having a quick answer to some of the obscure problems I ran into.\r\n",
