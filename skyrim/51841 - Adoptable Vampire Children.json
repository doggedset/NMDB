  "descriptionHtml": "I grew tired of not having vampire children run around a house of Vampires. So I made a mod that replaces the 4 children in the major cities with vampires. Since the only child vampire race belongs to the Bretons they have all been made into Vampire Breton Children. hope you enjoy this mod. :3\r<br />\r<br />So that people don&#39;t flood the comments with which children are they, they are:\r<br />\r<br />Alesan - Dawnstar\r<br />Blaise - Solitude\r<br />Lucia - Whiterun\r<br />Sophie - Windhelm\r<br />\r<br />The children at the Honorhall Orphanage in Riften are still human children so people can have a choice still. All I did was make a replacer for 4 of the children but I left you all with options.",
