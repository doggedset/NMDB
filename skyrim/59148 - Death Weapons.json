  "summary": "Want an overpowered cheaty sword and bow? Here you are.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is just a simple cheat mod: it provides you with two items called &#34;Death Blade&#34; and &#34;Death Bow&#34; that have a permanent no-cost soul trap enchantment on them, and do 1000 base damage.Â  Their appearance is identical to the Nightingale Blade and Nightingale Bow. Draw speed for the Death Bow is identical to Auriel&#39;s Bow.\r<br />\r<br />To simplify things there is no improvement recipe for either item. And really, with 1000 base damage, do you actually /need/ a grindstone?\r<br />\r<br />You can either give them to yourself at the console, or make them at any forge for a cost of 1 iron ingot and 1 leather strip, no smithing perks required.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements: None, uses only vanilla Skyrim resources.\r<br />\r<br />Permissions: Feel free to do anything with this, with or without crediting me.",
