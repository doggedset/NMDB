  "descriptionHtml": "This Overhaul completely changes your files. I&#39;ve looked everywhere to find the best\r<br />mods and configurations that I could online for a few years now, then I tried them all out in \r<br />different ways to find the type of Skyrim I wanted it to feel like. There&#39;s several bug \r<br />fixes and gameplay features were never fixed or added in the update. So here&#39;s New animated \r<br />movements and abilities that make the game feel better but still vanilla. Better \r<br />visuals on everything without ruining performance. I know it&#39;s a lot to read but \r<br />its really simple. (Also already cracked and updated).\r<br />\r<br />As long as you have Skyrim correctly installed through steam or manually this \r<br />will work.\r<br />\r<br />So first, you&#39;ll need to delete everything from your /Documents/My Games/Skyrim\r<br />path first. The same folder where tesv.exe and the Data folder are found in. \r<br />\r<br />Once you&#39;ve done that then copy all of my Skyrim files into the same folder.\r<br />Afterwards you&#39;ll want to copy my skyrim.ini and skyrimprefs.ini into your\r<br />/My Documents/My Games/Skyrim folder.\r<br />\r<br />This Overhaul is extremely compatible with itself. There are no problems or\r<br />glitches between the mods I&#39;ve placed that I can tell. You can always contact me if \r<br />there is an issue. \r<br />\r<br />It also already has script extenders and other commonly required content when \r<br />adding mods that alter animation, gameplay, dialogue, sounds, whatever it may be.\r<br />\r<br />Everything is already set up for you, the only thing you might need to do is\r<br />turn up/down the Texture Quality in the options menu or some of the other Qualities.\r<br />It&#39;s the menu when you launch SkyrimLauncher.exe (NOT skse_loader.exe).\r<br />\r<br />Don&#39;t mess the distances in the View Distance tab unless your game is seriously\r<br />running too slow. \r<br />\r<br />Part of this Overhaul is that it puts in a lot different features to make the \r<br />game feel more real. While also adding a lot of cool things to make the game even\r<br />more enjoyable without making it any easier. Take a look at the different features \r<br />from the mod list. I haven&#39;t had any trouble with compatibility.\r<br />\r<br />You&#39;ll have a lot of fun with this, so try it all out before you begin adding \r<br />anything to it.\r<br /> \r<br />After that you can just start the game. The skse_loader.exe is the launcher you \r<br />need for Skyrim to launch now. The SkyrimLauncher.exe won&#39;t do anything other than \r<br />show you the options menu before the game starts.\r<br />\r<br />As always, give the game time when installing mods. Once you&#39;ve finally gotten to a\r<br />spot out of the intro, Wait for a Day or so in GameTime. It just helps everything\r<br />settle and prevents crashing. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />P.S. As a lovely gift, Don&#39;t go too crazy with Serana... New Look, More Dialogue, New Abilities, and Now Marriable.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I will add a F.A.Q. once I get some questions\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t know much about computers but I&#39;ll give you the basic specs I see.\r<br />With my Computer specs this game runs more than perfect so don&#39;t worry if you have \r<br />less. And be happy if you have more, because you can turn up the quality even more.\r<br />\r<br />Motherboard: Asus ASUS M5A97 LE R2.0\r<br />Processor: AMD FX-4350 Vishera Quad-Core 4.2 GHz\r<br />Graphics Card: MSI GeForce GT 730 DirectX 12 N730K-1GD5LP/OC Core Clock 1006 MHz\r<br />               1GB 64-Bit GDDR5\r<br />Memory: G.SKILL Ripjaws X Series 16GB (2 x 8GB) Speed 1866\r<br />",
