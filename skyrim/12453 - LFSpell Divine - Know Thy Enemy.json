  "descriptionHtml": "LFSpell Divine - Know thy enemy!\r\nHave you ever been battling a bandit and wondered \\\"Wow, how much stamina does this guy have!\\\"\r\nOr fighting a Falmer and thought \\\"Ok is it just me or does this monster have a ton of magic resist?\\\"\r\nOr maybe considered which slain creature to raise from the dead as your minion.\r\nOr just been testing your latest mod and got tired of typing in a dozen console commands to see exactly how your opponents were developing... Well ponder no more.\r\n\r\nPlease let me introduce to you Divine!\r\n\r\nThis mod started off as just an easier way of monitoring the creatures etc I had modified in game and to save me a lot of time while play testing their increased strength and resistances.\r\nAfter a while of developing and testing it I realised it would be a nice mod all on its own.\r\nHopefully no-one else has made exactly the same thing (or worse still done it 10 times better :-)\r\n\r\nWhen you cast the spell at a target depending on how high your Alteration Skill is how much information you learn. A message box will appear (technically pausing the game) which will show you Level, Health, Stamina, Magicka, All skills above 15 (because by default everyone has 15 in a skill and the box can only handle so many lines) and finally resistances to Fire, Frost, Shock, Magic and Poison.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 versions of this mod at the moment, any more requests (within reason of course) let me know. PLEASE ONLY USE ONE VERSION!\r\n\r\nJust extract the contents into your \\\"Skyrim\\\" folder\r\n\r\nLFDivineTargetA = Makes this new spell a minor (A)bility to be used as and when you want without skill restrictions or taking up a precious spell slot, fires like a voice ability. This ability is available either through console command Player.Addspell 0x000d63 where \\\"x\\\" is the mod loaded order, or as a book you can buy from Tolfdir at the College of Winterhold.\r\n\r\nLFDivineTargetB = Is the (B)asic version of the spell, it can be obtained by either the console commands Player.Addspell 0x000d63 where \\\"x\\\" is the mod loaded order, or as a book you can buy from Tolfdir at the College of Winterhold.\r\n\r\nLFDivineTargetC = Is kind of a (C)heat version of the spell which costs you dam near nothing, has no skill pre-requisites and works fully right off the bat. For this version you have to use the console commands to add it (you already cheating might as well use the console to get it!) Player.Addspell 0x000d63 where \\\"x\\\" is the mod loaded order.\r\n\r\nAt Alteration Skill less than 24\r\nLevel:\r\n\r\nAt Alteration Skill 25 - 49\r\nLevel:\r\nHealth Current / Maximum\r\nStamina Current / Maximum\r\nMagicka Current / Maximum\r\n\r\nAt Alteration Skill 50 - 74\r\nLevel:\r\nHealth Current / Maximum\r\nStamina Current / Maximum\r\nMagicka Current / Maximum\r\nLists all Skills and levels that the target has (above 15)\r\n\r\nAt Alteration Skill 75+\r\nLevel:\r\nHealth Current / Maximum\r\nStamina Current / Maximum\r\nMagicka Current / Maximum\r\nLists all Skills and levels that the target has (above 15)\r\nResistance\\'s to Fire, Frost, Shock, Magic and Poison\r\n\r\nI have included the source code of the script if you want to change any aspects of the spell, but if you re-release it please give credit where credit is due.\r\nThe script itself is rather long winded so if anyone wants to streamline it please go ahead I\\'m anything but a master script writer and have no delusions to the contrary :-)\r\n\r\nI hope you all get some use out of this little mod, it took me a better part of 6 hours to get it all worked out and released but it has been a life saver time wise while testing my other mods.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
