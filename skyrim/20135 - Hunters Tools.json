  "descriptionHtml": "Name: Hunters Tools\r\nVersion: 0.2\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\nDescription:\r\nI am playing a hunter myself, and my armor is the Warchief Armor from the Immersive Armor mod (really great mod guys, check it out) and the bow with the highest damage, the Daedric bow just didn\\'t suit that. So I decided to edit some weapons so I can use them later End-Game. The weapons are all close to Daedric but just a slightly but less powerful. Note that these items can be crafted and bought very early in the game but have some self-control and use them later, if you want a balanced game atleast.\r\n\r\nFew tips to (role-)play Hunter by the way:\r\n\r\nAs race you can choose Khajit or you can become a Vampire for Night Eye/Vampire\\'s Sight, allowing you to hunt much better in the dark.\r\n\r\nFor skills pick either Light or Heavy Armor, depending on your combat-style which will be Archery or One-Handed + Block\r\n\r\nSo for skills, go with Archery and/or One-Handed + Block, use weapons that fit hunter (Hide, Wooden, Iron).\r\n\r\nAnd if you want to make it easier to find your prey, go use alteration for the Detect Life spell (Might add a Hunter Version so you aren\\'t forced to train in Alteration)\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\nTo-Do/Upcoming:\r\n- Bear Traps\r\n- Hunters Ally: Weapon Enchantment, any non-undead/non-dremora/non-automaton will fight on your side for <dur> seconds, will only have few charges per Grand Soul Gem to keep it from being super-overpowered.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\nItems:\r\n\r\nWeapons - Direct Melee:\r\n\r\nHuntsman\\'s Axe:\r\nA Axe using the template of Woodcutter\\'s Axe, swings at normal speed for an axe and has a base damage of 14. It can be crafted under Steel.\r\n\r\n_______________________________\r\nWeapons: Distance Melee:\r\n\r\nInfused Lightning Bow:\r\nElectrocute your enemies!\r\n\r\n10% Faster drawing speed than other bows.\r\nDamages your opponents health and magicka.\r\nBase Damage: 18\r\n\r\nInfused Frost Bow:\r\nGive them a nice cold ;)\r\n\r\n10% Slower drawing speed than other bows (Frost slows down eh).\r\nDamages your opponents health and stamina. \r\nBase Damage: 20\r\n\r\nInfused Fire Bow:\r\nHeat them up!\r\n\r\nSame drawing speed.\r\nDamages only health.\r\nBase Damage: 18\r\n\r\nDimension Transfer Bow:\r\nWait what Dimension are you from?\r\nSummons an [b]Unbound[/b] Dremora, bewary, this attacks you! This is actually just for fun or if you want to have a training dummy, but he is pretty strong.\r\nBase Damage: 18\r\nSame drawing speed.\r\n\r\n_______________________________\r\n\r\nArmor:\r\n\r\nHuntsman\\'s Shield:\r\n\r\nHide Shield, Base Block Rating/Armor of 38, can be crafted under Hide.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Every arrow has to hit a NPC Target to make the effect happen, EVEN the summoning ones.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\nLocation:\r\nBuy them from the Riverwood Trader.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\nBugs/Incompatible:\r\nI\\'m not aware of any bugs, though I still need to work on it a lot more, please post any!\r\n------------------------------------------\r\nExtra:\r\nIf you use the console you might find the following weapons:\r\nSniper Bow (Extremely long range and precise, high damage but takes 10 times as long too load)\r\nVolley Bow (Shoots 100 arrows at once at the cost of 1, but only the first one actually gets there, the others drop down almost immediately)\r\nSwift Bow (Simple weak bow that shoots quickly)\r\n\r\nAlso the reason you see no quiver is because I have a no quiver mod and I\\'m too lazy to uninstall it.",
