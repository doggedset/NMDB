  "modName": "Female to Male Bards - WIP",
  "summary": "Changes all female bards to male versions.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Reasons behind this mod: first, it came out of frustration with poorly sang female songs in Skyrim. These songs sound false as hell.\r<br />Second - I did not like Windhelm&#39;s default bard - Luaffyn. Damn gray skin stinker (and yeah, a female dunmer singing stormcloak songs is all the definition of a hypocrisy). So I changed her into this guy. \r<br />\r<br />This is the first installment, beta stage.\r<br />I present you Harald Blood-Spiller, staunch supporter of Stormcloaks and a great bard. Hope you will like him.\r<br />This mod is in beta phase, hope there won&#39;t be any problems with that guy. \r<br />\r<br />Disclaimer: I know there are some mods that change female songs to Malukah&#39;s creations. Well, I do respect her achievements and I think she is a great singer, altough these ooooohs and aaaahs do not befit the songs of Skyrim, because these are songs about blood, steel and war. And warriors rather ROAR than oooooh. ;)\r<br />\r<br />Don&#39;t like - don&#39;t download, simple as that.\r<br />\r<br />Bugs: \r<br />none&#33; please report if you find any. \r<br />\r<br />changelog:\r<br />\r<br />0.9a\r<br />-small bugfix update.\r<br />\r<br />0.9\r<br />-initial release.\r<br />-Luaffyn is now Harald Blood-Spiller.",
