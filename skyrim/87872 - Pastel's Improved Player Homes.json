  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#d8d8d8]Hello! I'm sure you've all noticed that the base game player homes are... pretty basic and impersonal.\n<br />\n<br />Goal:\n<br />The aim of this mod is to overhaul all of the player homes that the base game gives us, making them more interesting and personalized, all while remaining game, lore, and roleplay friendly. The idea is to take the base shape of the homes and completely redesign them from scratch, from the 'empty' pre-upgrade house to a fully furnished home.\n<br />\n<br />Improved Homes:\n<br />Breezehome\n<br />\n<br />Planned Improvements:\n<br />Hjerim\n<br />Honeyside\n<br />Proudspire Manor\n<br />Vlindrel Hall\n<br />[/color]Hearthfires homes\n<br />Faction homes\n<br />\n<br />Requirements:\n<br />All DLCs\n<br />Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch\n<br />*Fresh save\n<br />[i][size=1]*recommended[/size][/i]",
