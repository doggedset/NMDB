  "summary": "Adds in a squad of followers into the game. I recommend using a mod that lets you have multiple followers.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Adds in 7 or 8 followers into the game from a super fast cold-blooded assasin to a passive archer. Use with caution because all these soldiers are super powerful so don\\'t use them if you are trying to level-up. I added as followers an assasin, a archer, an explosive guy, warrior priest, a mage, two commanders, and a heavy. They can all be found in the basement of whiterun dragonsreach I am hoping to move them eventually but havn\\'t yet.",
