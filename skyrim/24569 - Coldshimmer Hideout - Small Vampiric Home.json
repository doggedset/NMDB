  "descriptionHtml": "REQUIRES DAWNGUARD. Don\\'t come crying to me if your game crashes at startup. \r\n\r\nA small player home I made to fit my own tastes. I just wanted a (very) small home that was functional as well. It comes with an automatic sorting system (practically the same thing as the system found in Leveler\\'s Tower by WillieSea, albeit a bit less meticulous), and a barrel that spawns an infinite number of Lesser Blood Potions (Weaker Blood Potions for vampires, with no nourishment, and a smaller health boon). It\\'s also fully navmeshed. \r\n\r\nThe home is fully furnished and comes with all crafting tools, safe storage (every container in the building is safe), a coffin, a Deathhound that lounges around the bedroom, Cattle, a civil war map (like the one you\\'d find in Jarl palaces), and a number of display tools (mannequins, weapon racks/plagues, and bookshelves). \r\n\r\nIt has a map marker and is located just south of Winterhold, following the bend of the mountain to the West. \r\n\r\nThis is not a year-long project, it\\'s not revolutionary, and it\\'s not Mod of The Year, All Years.  If it does manage to win MOTY, AY, I am both incredibly disappointed in the Nexus community, and accepting of all forms of praise and worship. \r\n\r\nWHERE YOUR STUFF GOES WHEN YOU AUTO SORT:\r\n\r\nMain room:\r\nMost smithing supplies go to the chest near the forge\r\n\r\nSide Lab:\r\nSoul Gems go to Strongbox above Enchanting Table\r\nIngredients go to Satchel on Alchemy Lab\r\nPotions go to Strongbox above Alchemy Lab\r\n\r\nSide Kitchen:\r\nFood goes to the Longtable on the left side of the room\r\n\r\nBedroom:\r\nWeapons go to Weapons chest in front of coffin\r\nArmor goes to Armor chest in front of coffin\r\nBooks and Scrolls go to cabinet to the left of coffin\r\nGems go to Strongbox on desk\r\nMisc and keys go in the desk\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nInstallation:\r\n1. Download NMM\r\n2. Install using that\r\n\r\nActivating the Mod\r\n\r\n1) Start Mod Manager\r\n2) Activate VampHome.esp\r\n\r\nUninstallation:\r\n\r\n1. Uninstall using NMM\r\n\r\n*Shock, awe*\r\n\r\nUpdating:\r\n\r\nThis shouldn\\'t even be an issue.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCREDITS:\r\n\r\nWillieSea - Providing the base for the only two scripts I\\'ve added\r\nSimpsonFly - Being SimpsonFly\r\n\r\nPERMISSION:\r\n\r\nStealing this mod is like hitting an old lady with a car.",
