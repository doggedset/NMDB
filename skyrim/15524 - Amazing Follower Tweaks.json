May take up to 30 seconds to appear.\r<br />\r<br />[b]=== Details === [/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b]- Increased max followers to 5[/b]\r<br />\r<br />I could have made it more, but there are too many small interiors and doorways that start to  feel really cramped if you play with too many followers.  I personally prefer no more than 3,  but I bumped it up to 5 due to popular demand. \r<br />\r<br />[b]  - AI Improvements: [/b]\r<br />\r<br />Followers avoid/ignore traps, interact with environments, auto-toggle helmets, recharge their weapons, forgive friendly fire. And all of this is optional of coarse. \r<br />\r<br />[b]- Control Follower Outfits[/b]\r<br />\r<br />(version 1.6) When managing follower outfits, followers receive a backpack. Then you can assign whatever items and weapons you want them to use and put everything else in the backpack. AFT includes 3 configurable outfits. An outfit is simply a list of items from the backpack. There is a standard list, an in-city list and an in-home list. When changing areas, AFT will automatically transfer items to and from the backpack so that your follower automatically equips the pre-configured outfits. \r<br />\r<br />Feel free to create your outfit out of your favorite custom mod items.\r<br />\r<br />[b]- Teach Followers new spells[/b]: \r<br />\r<br />Aft supports two spell types: Regular Spells and Tweak Spells. You can teach a follower either type by equipping known spells and selecting the appropriate option from the magic menu.\r<br />\r<br />Regular spells are handled by the games standard combat AI. However you may also create up to 4 &#34;Tweak&#34; Spells that can be customized to cast under certain conditions on  certain players. This is especially handy for creating cleric type characters.\r<br />\r<br />DragonBorn DLC and Dawnguard DLC spells supported.\r<br />\r<br />[b]- Dismiss Followers, but tell them to hang out where you are[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Handy for keeping all your followers in one location (like your house).  \r<br />\r<br />[b]- Turn followers into werewolves&#33;[/b]\r<br />\r<br />If you are a werewolf,  just tell them to drink your blood. You can then configure the conditions in which they will change from their combat style menu\r<br />\r<br />[b]- Turn followers into vampires[/b]\r<br />\r<br />If you are a vampire, feel free to &#34;embrace&#34; your follower. They will become a vampire and gain the expected resistances and spells. \r<br />\r<br />[b]- Turn followers into vampire lords[/b]\r<br />\r<br />If you happen to have Dawnguard, you will be able to upgrade your followers to pure-blood vampire lords. This means they aren&#39;t disfigured in the face and can transform into Vampire Lord form. \r<br />\r<br />[b]- Control Follower Combat Style[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Encourages AI through bonus damage incentives. Assigning a combat style also enables AFT to manage your follower stats and level them up with the player beyond their cap. \r<br />\r<br />The &#34;Spell Sword&#34; and &#34;Mage Staff&#34; styles include micro-managed combat AI that ensures followers use a combination of their weapon and spells. \r<br />\r<br />[b]- Manage Level Up[/b]\r<br />\r<br />AFT supports both Auto and Manual Level Up modes so you can do nothing or specify where every last stat and skill point goes. It is your call. When managed, your follower will continue to receive stat and skill bonuses even beyond their level cap. \r<br />\r<br />[b]- Remotely command followers in combat[/b]\r<br />\r<br />A Tweak Command Power lets you direct followers during combat. Tell followers to attack or hold back, summon them to you or even tell followers to transform into their Beast forms.\r<br />\r<br />[b]- Pose Followers[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Have followers strike a pose or dance and then have them stay that way. A fun way to add ambience to your camp or house.\r<br />\r<br />[b]- Possess the body of your followers (Vampires only)[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Charge into combat possessing the body of a follower (who has maybe transformed into a werewolf?). When your follower falls, you will transfer back to the players body, safely stashed away around the corner. \r<br />\r<br />[b]- Stealth Mode[/b]\r<br />\r<br />A power that makes all followers invisible and muffled until [b]YOU[/b] get caught. Great for assassination missions.\r<br />\r<br />[b]- Tell Followers to Make camp[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Very basic tent, sleeping bags, and fire.  Enable the enhanced AI and tell followers to WAIT at camp if you wish to see them make use of the camp elements. \r<br />\r<br />[b]- Option: Followers cant die[/b]\r<br />\r<br />For people that don&#39;t like reloading. \r<br />\r<br />[b]- Option: Followers Catch up on weapon draw[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Following the player across skyrim&#39;s treacherous terrain can be difficult. Luckly, followers will catch up to you anytime you draw your weapon. Handy when you find yourself surrounded by enemies.\r<br />\r<br />[b]- Option: Ask Followers to sleep anywhere[/b]\r<br />\r<br />A boon for vampires who can use followers as a travelling happy meal.\r<br />\r<br />[b]- Option: Beast form followers ignored just like summoned creatures.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />You can walk around with 2 Daedric Lords, so why do people care if you have a werewolf or two? This option prevents people from attacking you on sight if you have werewolf or Vampire Lord followers. \r<br />\r<br />[b]- Option: Followers Ride Horses[/b]\r<br />\r<br />It is amazing how much immersion it adds to see your followers mount up. See readme for restrictions.\r<br />\r<br />[b]- Option : 1000 carrying capacity for Followers[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Get through 2 whole quests before needing to visit a merchant.\r<br />\r<br />[b]- Item De-duplication[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Followers can automatically remove duplicate items from your inventory. (some items like arrows, soul gems, nirnroots and lock picks are ignored)\r<br />\r<br />[b]- Followers can auto Fence items[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Save time when you have 5 followers sporting 5000 lbs of inventory. Nice when combined with Item de-duplication. \r<br />\r<br />[b]- Option : Control Follower Aggression [/b]\r<br />\r<br />Prevent them from attacking people when you are trying to sneak around. \r<br />\r<br />[b]- Option : Control Follower Courage [/b]\r<br />\r<br />Prevent them from running from combat.\r<br />\r<br />[b]- Option : Control Follower Morality [/b]\r<br />\r<br />Ever get tired of a follower refusing to do something you tell them to? Well, this mod makes sure that doesn&#39;t happen. \r<br />\r<br />[b]- Additional Marriage Options[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Illia, Aranea, Eola, Ugor, and Lydia by popular request. Also Erik the Slayer, Golldir, Ahtar.\r<br />\r<br />[b]- Ability to remove Follower Bows[/b]\r<br />\r<br />What can I say. The bow on the back is irritating. \r<br />\r<br />[b]- Bonus Outfit Support** (See readme for details)[/b]\r<br />\r<br />A custom outfit you can have any follower put on. Outfit packs coming soon. \r<br />\r<br />[b]- Minor bug fixes:[/b]\r<br /> \r<br />Lydia no longer sits in your Breeze home room all day like a stalker.\r<br />\r<br />Click on version number at top of page to see a list of specific version updates and improvements. \r<br />\r<br />[b]=== Cleaning AFT ===[/b]\r<br />\r<br />AFT has 6 dirty edits which have been left in the mod intentionally. Those who use boss will get messages about this.\r<br />\r<br />It is safe to clean AFT if you are starting a new game or installing AFT for the first time in a game that has never previously had AFT. It is NOT safe to clean AFT if you wish to use/upgrade old save games where you previously had AFT installed.  \r<br />\r<br />Promo:\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]LZQnNKhYVaM[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Overview:\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]3qWSqxY-zVY[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Compatible Mods[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Below I include a list of mods whos authors have contacted me and assured me that AFT is compatible \r<br />with their mod.
