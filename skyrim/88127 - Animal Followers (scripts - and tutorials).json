Very hard to understand, long videos. Or short guides that skip important steps and don't explain things very well. So, while creating my first mod, I had to jump from tutorial to tutorial in order to understand fully how everything works. This caused my projects to become very tedious and time consuming. Additionally, a lot of guides don't tell you very crucial things that you NEED to avoid, which led to me re-installing Skyrim+all of my mods about 7 times. \n<br />\n<br />So, in a nutshell, I decided to make my own in-depth, easy to follow tutorial. This is an intermediate guide meant for beginners. I will be covering the entire process, start-to-finish.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][size=5][u][b]REQUIREMENTS[/b][/u][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][color=#6fa8dc][url=http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/NifSkope.shtml]Nifskope[/url]\n<br />[/color]Creation Kit\n<br />Text viewing application\n<br />Image viewing application[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=5][u][b]How to use/install this resource:[/b][/u][/size][/color]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />[color=#f6b26b][u]STEP 1:[/u][/color][/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]Manually download the compressed file.[/size]\n<br />[/list][color=#f6b26b][size=3][u]STEP 2:[/u][/size][/color]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]Using [color=#00ff00]7zip[/color], (or whatever program you use to unpack zipped files) extract the folder to anywhere that you will be able to get to quickly.
