  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#00ffff][size=6]ClefJ&#39;s Rorikstead[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />We can all admit that Rorikstead, as the first town to come out of a man&#39;s mouth is pretty underwhelming. And indeed, there are some wonderful Rorikstead mods already out there&#33; Superior Rorikstead and JK&#39;s work are marvelous in their own right. But, I still wanted something... Smaller. More homey. No massive walls or city gates, nothing that makes it bigger than Riverwood. This is for the player that would like a town mod that makes it look like it would&#39;ve been there in the original game. There is no blacksmith in town, since the innkeep has to go to Whiterun to get his son some armor. Hopefully there&#39;s enough room in people&#39;s games to accomodate a tiny mod like this&#33; \r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00]What this adds: [/color]\r<br />- Hearthfire items, such as carrots and chimneys and ovens, etc. \r<br />- The woven fences have for the most part been replaced with stone fences, giving it a real Scottish feel. \r<br />- Minor details inspired by JK&#39;s work, such as small barns&#33; \r<br />- A new player home, a water-pump mill (the key is in the boss skull bowl at Bleakwind Bluff)&#33;\r<br />- A new merchant abode, Generally Good Goods, with 3 new npc&#39;s. \r<br />- A small lake behind the inn, as well as an apple orchard.\r<br />- Oak trees, thanks to [color=#00ff00]Hoddminir[/color].\r<br />- Harvestable apple trees, thanks to [color=#00ff00]ChickenDownUnder[/color].\r<br />- Static food containers, thanks to [color=#00ff00]Blary[/color].\r<br />- Custom bed meshes and textures, thanks to [color=#00ff00]Mirrou4ka[/color].\r<br />- Cleaned with TES5Edit&#33; Some navmesh modification has occured, of course.\r<br />- Common furniture upgraded to Upper in Rorik&#39;s Manor.\r<br />I may add more flora or modify the tavern interior in the future&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Requirements:[/color]\r<br />- Hearthfire\r<br />-Update\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Incompatibilities:[/color]\r<br />-Any major exterior mod to Rorikstead.[/center]",
