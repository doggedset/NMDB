  "descriptionHtml": "Firstly an apology for my bad English.\r\nSecondly this is my first mod \\\"scrools elder\\\" and hence need ideas and adjustments.\r\nThis is my version 0.1, with only the exterior of the castle and free movement and character.\r\n\r\nOften confused with castles and forts and palaces stately residences. The former are compact in easily defended and thought to the war, the second for the opulence and majesty.\r\n\r\nMy idea is to build a castle with all the features medieval and with the same construction criteria.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore constituted by two squares, one dungeon and six buildings:\r\n\r\nSquare-outside (for traders and foreign)\r\n  market\r\n  inn\r\n  stable\r\n\r\nSquare-arms, (interior)\r\n  Quarters (residence of low-level employees), with 3 levels\r\n  Prison, with 3 levels.\r\n  Keep and fortress (residence of Mr. and high-level employees), with 5 levels.\r\n  Backsmith, with 1 level\r\n  Inn, with 2 levels.\r\n  Dungeon, multi-level\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\nOn the hill west of Fort Greymoor; and east of Swindler\\'s Den.\r\nCoordinates tamriel (-9, -1)\r\n\r\nI will start the construction of interior and after NPC\\'s.\r\nI would appreciate testing and ideas.\r\n\r\nHISTORY:\r\n0.1 : External structure and tamriel adaptions\r\n0.1a : Internal structure to middle of main tower.\r\n0.1b : Remove the old structure of 0.1a, create new in middle of main tower and top. All doors of mainTower as functional.\r\n0.1d : Basic access and structure to interior objects.\r\n0.1e : Structure and basic furniture to barracks, inn and smith",
