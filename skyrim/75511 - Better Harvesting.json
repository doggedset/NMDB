No more will you just harvest 1 flower or pick up 1 mushroom, or 1 snowberry when harvesting flora, or harvest 1 mammoth tusk from a mammoth, or 1 sabre cat tooth from a sabre cat, or 1 hagraven feather from a hagraven---you will instead get a realistic random amount that reflects what you are harvesting. I have gone round all the flora, ingredients etc you harvest from plants or dead animals in the base game and DLC and based on my judgement picked a realistic amount you could randomly harvest taking into account what you harvest, the item harvested, and the size of the thing you&#39;re harvesting. So don&#39;t worry you won&#39;t get 3 sabre cat eyes, or 5 goat legs, just an amount that I think is more realistic and not too much that it makes harvesting overpowered.... you still have to harvest but not quite as much now.\r<br />\r<br />For example, in the vanilla game harvesting a small blue flower bush would give you 1 blue flower, now you will get a random amount between 1-5 flowers, a larger blue flower bush giving you between 3-10. Harvesting a dead mudcrab gives you a random amount between 1-3 mudcrab legs and 1-2 claws, rather than just the 1 in vanilla, and so on.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=3]This mod also removes finding gold coins, necklaces, rings, gems etc on dead animals. I never liked this feature in the game when I killed a deer or a mudcrab i would find 10 gold coins or a silver necklace. So no more of that rubbish, just meat, fur, and whatever else the animal contains. [/size][color=#ff7700][size=2][i]*edit - by request I have added optional versions where animals still drop loot and valuables.[/i][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00]Q. What&#39;s different about this mod to all the other harvesting mods.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]There&#39;s a few harvesting mods out there that do pretty much the same as this, but most are not up to date with USLEEP changes, or they contain scripts or don&#39;t cover all the flora in all the DLC. Also this mod is compatible and works alongside Wiseman&#39;s Flora Fixes and Flora Respawn Fix (both of those mods fix a bug in the game where flora doesn&#39;t respawn so go get one of those if you haven&#39;t already). This mod contains all the changes from the latest version of USLEEP but doesn&#39;t require USLEEP, but i highly recommend getting USLEEP as its pretty much essential to any playthrough. Also, it doesn&#39;t add any other flora or ingredients to the game, keeps it nice and simple and just changes what was in the base game and all 3 dlc. If you want added meats or plants or ingredients and loads more then something like Complete Alchemy and Cooking Overhaul would be better suited.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00]Q. What dlc or mods does this require.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]It requires all 3 DLC, Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn. You don&#39;t need Wiseman&#39;s Flora Fixes OR Flora Respawn Fix to use this, but there are 3 main files to download, 1 is for if you don&#39;t use those 2 mods (so just the 3 dlc required), 1 is for Wiseman&#39;s Flora Fixes (required) and the other for Flora Respawn Fix (required). Use ONLY 1 of those.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00]Q. Load order[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Place it after Wiseman&#39;s Flora Fixes or Flora Respawn Fix or any mod that alters the flora, ingredients or death items on animals/creatures (it alters the levelled lists for death items on animals and a few other levelled lists like amount of gold found in coin purses).[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700]Happy harvesting&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]If there is any amounts you feel are wrong or need changing or tweaked please let me know.[/size][/center]",
