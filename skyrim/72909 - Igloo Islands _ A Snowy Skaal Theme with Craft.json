These items are separate from original Skaal and Fur clothing.  \r<br />Note 3: Armor and weapons use the mesh/textures in your game (except the shield?).Craft the bow, arrow, and at any blacksmith furniture.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][color=#00ffff]Cooking:[/color][/b][/u]\r<br />Two additional food recipes are included.\r<br />Horker Stew Special\r<br />Fish Stew Special\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][color=#00ffff]NPC:[/color][/b][/u]\r<br />3 NPC followers are basic silent and stealthy.  They should not trigger simple traps.\r<br />Sami the Fur Trader, male, merchant/follower/marriageable \r<br />Nanook, male, follower/marriageable \r<br />Nyla, female, follower/marriageable \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]FAQs:[/b][/u]\r<br />1.  I see something already done in a different mod....\r<br />A.  This mod began over a year ago, so you may find features similar in newer mods.\r<br />\r<br />2.  Why release it now?  \r<br />A. I thought someone else might enjoy the igloos.  Maybe one day I will finish a big island that I like, but until then enjoy the igloos.\r<br />\r<br />3.  Why are there different islands?\r<br />A.  The mod has gone through many revisions.  I keep bulldozing the main islands.  Plus, I wanted an island with some snow-covered trees.\r<br />\r<br />4.  You need more wildlife for an immersive village&#33;\r<br />A.  Sorry.  See above.  I tried to learn how to build an LOD but failed, so I deleted my first island (yes, I know about Dyndolod).  Then I bulldozed my second island.  Then a third.  After hand navmeshing all the islands that I ended up deleting, I took a break.  So I created these simple islands to enjoy the igloos.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Possible continued development:\r<br />-Improve domestic reindeer\r<br />-Expanded islands with creatures\r<br />I&#39;m undecided if I will publish any tweaks beyond bug fixes.  Depends on feedback.\r<br />\r<br />Assets:\r<br />Many thanks to: berticus, blary, elianora, flintone, ghosu, insanitysorrow, jokerine, lolicept, oaristys, and tamira.\r<br />See the permissions tab for details.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Now for a little fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Igloo 101[/size]\r<br />[size=1]How much do you know about igloos?  [/size]\r<br />[size=1][url=http://www-tc.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/assets/swf/1/igloo-101/igloo-101.swf]Try this quiz and see&#33;[/url][/size]",
