  "descriptionHtml": "[size=\\\"7\\\"][b]Evolving Bound Weapons\r\nv1.22 Beta[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[size=\\\"5\\\"][b]-==Please endorse if you like my mod!==-[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[b]-==Some News==-[/b]\r\nHey guys. I really appreciate all the support! Right now though, I\\'m very much focused on my [url=\\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23882\\\"]Spell Combos[/url] mod so there won\\'t be any updates for EBW for the time being. I haven\\'t abandoned it though! This is my first mod after all, so it\\'s got a special place in my heart. I still have plans I want to implement for this mod, and hey maybe in the future I\\'ll merge Spell Combos and EBW into one big magic overhaul mod (long-term goal). My permissions for this mod remain the same at least. You can use this mod\\'s resources and whatnot for your own mod without the need to ask for permission (though I\\'d appreciate some acknowledgement; also, some of the models aren\\'t mine so you should credit them as well). Again, thanks for all the support!\r\n\r\n[size=\\\"5\\\"][b]-==Version 1.22 Beta==-[/b][/size]\r\n-The issue that causes no weapons to appear when cast has been fixed (hopefully).\r\n-Weapon evolution will now depend on having the Mystic Binding perk and the weapon skill (sneak, one-handed, marksman) only.\r\n-Download 1.2 for the folders and replace the esp with 1.22.\r\n-[b]NOTE 1:[/b] If your weapon skill is less than 20, but you have the Mystic Binding perk, NOTHING will appear. You have to get the weapon skill to at least 20.\r\n-[b]NOTE 2:[/b] If your weapon skill is more than or equal to 20, but you don\\'t have the Mystic Binding Perk, NOTHING will appear. You should spend on the Mystic Binding perk immediately.\r\n\r\n[size=\\\"5\\\"][b]-==Version 1.2==-[/b][/size]\r\n-Weapons now look like bound weapons (without the flames, since it obscures the already-transparent weapons)\r\n-Evolving spells can now be cast with either hand\r\n-Evolving daggers and swords can be equipped to the casting hand (left or right)\r\n-Dual wielding now possible\r\n-Evolution of spells depend on Mystic Binding perk, Conjuration skill level, and the weapon\\'s skill level (one-handed, sneak, marksman)\r\n-Spell tomes should be sold in the shops now\r\n-Install/uninstall instructions still apply\r\n-Just to be safe, you might want to uninstall the old version fist (see below), save, then load up the new version (may not be necessary, but better safe than sorry)\r\n\r\n[size=\\\"3\\\"][b]-==Planned v1.4 Beta Release==-[/b][/size]\r\n-Evolving Bound Greatsword\r\n-Evolving Bound Battleaxe\r\n-Maybe (no promises) patches for SkyRe and/or Bound Weapons Redux\r\n-I may release Evolving Bound Armors as well (until a modder allows usage of his/her resources, Vanilla resources only)\r\n\r\n[size=\\\"3\\\"][b]-===Why make this mod?===-[/b][/size]\r\nI\\'m a big fan of bound weapons. It\\'s convenient, easy to use, and reliable. I like the idea of my enemies suddenly having that \\\"Oh Crap\\\" moment once they realize that the squishy mage they\\'re about to mug is actually a capable warrior. It\\'s all good in theory, but in reality there\\'s no way to tell whether a conjurer\\'s bound weapon is any good. The truth is, bound weapons get old really fast. They easily get overshadowed by weapons that can be forged, sharpened, and enchanted. My mod aims to make bound weapons a more viable long-term playstyle.\r\n\r\n[size=\\\"3\\\"][b]-===What\\'s the mod all about?===-[/b][/size]\r\nIt \\\"evolves\\\" bound weapons by changing the models and textures slowly as the player gains more levels in the conjuration skill. This is not merely a cosmetic change. The stats change with interesting effects. It begins changing once you\\'ve got the mystic binding perk. I\\'m trying to make this as balanced as possible, but it\\'s not my top priority since I want to make bound weapons a staple throughout an entire playthrough. Though if you\\'ve got any balancing suggestions, go ahead and comment.\r\n\r\n[b][size=\\\"5\\\"]-===Installation===-[/size][/b]\r\nPlace the files and folders inside the Data folder into the Data folder of your game (\\\\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim\\\\ Data).  Activate via Skyrim Launcher.\r\n\r\n[b][size=\\\"3\\\"]-===Mod Conflicts===-[/size][/b]\r\nThis mod is as stand-alone as possible. It does, however, rely on Vanilla Skyrim\\'s conjuration skill. So if you\\'ve got a perk tree mod that somehow removes the conjuration tree (effectively removing the conjuration skill), then it won\\'t work. At worst, it might crash your game. ALSO, I tested this mod with Skyrim 1.6. So I\\'m not sure if this will work with the Dawnguard DLC. If you have Dawnguard, use this at your own risk.\r\n\r\n[size=\\\"5\\\"][b]-===Usage===-[/b][/size]\r\nYou\\'ll find the spell tomes of the spells in the torturer\\'s knapsack (where you\\'ll find your first lockpick) in Helgen Keep\\'s torture room. You might also be able to find it in shops around Skyrim. Alternatively, you can use the console method.\r\n\tOpen up the console and type:\r\n\thelp evolv\r\n\tIt should come up with a list of IDs. Press PgUp (page up) to scroll up the list. \tLook for the bound spell you have with you and take note of its ID (note: it should have SPEL before the name).\r\n\tType:\r\n\tplayer.addpell <bound spell\\'s ID>\r\n\tDefault ID\\'s (meaning, no other mods use these ID):\r\n\tEvolving Bound Dagger 3b003898\r\n\tEvolving Bound Sword 3b00183a\r\n\tEvolving Bound Bow 3b004376\r\n\r\n[size=\\\"5\\\"][b]-===Uninstallation===-[/b][/size]\r\n-Open up the console and type:\r\nhelp evolv\r\n-It should come up with a list of IDs. Press PgUp (page up) to scroll up the list. Look for the bound spell you have with you and take note of its ID (note: it should have SPEL before the name).\r\n-Type:\r\nplayer.removespell <bound spell\\'s ID>\r\nDefault ID\\'s (meaning, no other mods use these ID):\r\nEvolving Bound Dagger 3b003898\r\nEvolving Bound Sword 3b00183a\r\nEvolving Bound Bow 3b004376\r\nDo remove spells for all evolving bound spells of your character\r\n-Exit your game and delete the .esp file along with the other files.\r\n\r\n[b]-===Known Bugs===-[/b]\r\n-The spell\\'s ready effect may not show. It\\'ll look like your character is readying an invisible spell.\r\n-The bound weapons do not have the swirly fire effects of Vanilla bound weapons. For some reason, I can\\'t get the particle shaders to work. If you know how, PLEASE teach me.\r\n-Currently, one handed bound weapons only equip on the right hand. Sorry lefties.\r\n-Bound casting may not work while mounted.\r\n-Bound Weapons will not show up in the inventory while equipped.\r\n\r\n[b]-===Future Plans===-[/b]\r\n-Get the particle shaders to work (unless it really doesn\\'t work with weapons).\r\n-Bound dual wielding (sorry dual wielders).\r\n-More bound weapon types (axes, hammers, battleaxes, great swords)\r\n-Evolving Bound Armor perhaps? I plan on basing it off of Leazer\\'s Bound Armor (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10197), so if that does come to pass I\\'d like to have his permission to use his mod.\r\n\r\n[b]-===Miscellaneous===-[/b]\r\n-This is my very first mod, and I have a very basic level of Creation Kit knowledge. I may not be aware of some bugs that are apparent. If you do find bugs, please leave them in the comments.\r\n-Sadly, I can\\'t be held accountable for any crashes or corrupted saves (though that\\'s a very extreme scenario). Please back up your saves before using my mod.\r\n-I only did this in my spare time, so please don\\'t expect super fast updates.\r\n-I NEED HELP getting the particle shaders to work. For some reason, it just won\\'t appear. Any veteran help would be much appreciated.\r\n-For the evolving bound armor plan: I NEED HELP getting the player\\'s previously equipped armor piece (script). This is so that your character won\\'t be totally naked once the armor effect disappears. But that\\'s just a future plan thing. I still need permission from Leazer to use his mod, since his already has a good working bound armor mod anyway (except for that whole naked thing).\r\n-You can use this mod as freely as you wish, but I\\'d appreciate some acknowledgement.\r\n\r\n[b]-===Mod Specifics===-[/b]\r\nOne Handed Sword Growth:\r\n-Growing Bound Sword\r\n\t-Requires: Default\r\n\t-Dmg: 10\r\n\t-Speed: 1.0\r\n-Evolved Bound Sword\r\n\t-Requires: Mystic Binding, Conjuration 20\r\n\t-Damage: 12\r\n\t-Speed: 1.2\r\n\t-Crit % Multiplier: 5.0\r\n\t-Crit Damage: 6\r\n-Mighty Bound Sword\r\n\t-Requires: Mystic Binding, Conjuration 40\r\n\t-Damage: 14\r\n\t-Speed: 1.1\r\n\t-Crit % Multiplier: 10.0\r\n\t-Crit Damage: 6\r\n\t-Fortifies stamina regen by 20%\r\n-Rising Bound Sword\r\n\t-Requires: Mystic Binding, Conjuration 60\r\n\t-Damage: 16\r\n\t-Speed: 1.1\r\n\t-Crit % Multiplier: 12.0\r\n\t-Crit Damage: 7\r\n\t-Slows down time for 10 seconds on cast\r\n\t-Fortifies stamina regen by 25%\r\n-Ultimate Bound Sword\r\n\t-Requires: Mystic Binding, Conjuration 80\r\n\t-Damage: 20\r\n\t-Speed: 1.3\r\n\t-Crit % Multiplier: 15.0\r\n\t-Crit Damage: 9\r\n\t-Slows down time for 15 seconds on cast\r\n\t-Fortifies stamina regen by 35%\r\n\r\nDagger Growth:\r\n-Growing Bound Dagger\r\n\t-Requires: Default\r\n\t-Dmg: 6\r\n\t-Speed: 1.4\r\n-Evolved Bound Dagger\r\n\t-Requires: Mystic Binding, Conjuration 20\r\n\t-Damage: 8\r\n\t-Speed: 1.4\r\n\t-Crit % Multiplier: 8.0\r\n\t-Crit Damage: 6\r\n\t-Casting becomes silent (across succeeding evolutions)\r\n-Mighty Bound Dagger\r\n\t-Requires: Mystic Binding, Conjuration 40\r\n\t-Damage: 10\r\n\t-Speed: 1.4\r\n\t-Crit % Multiplier: 13.0\r\n\t-Crit Damage: 7\r\n\t-Adds paralysis on crit (across succeeding evolutions)\r\n\t-Casts invisibility for 10 seconds\r\n-Rising Bound Dagger\r\n\t-Requires: Mystic Binding, Conjuration 60\r\n\t-Damage: 12\r\n\t-Speed: 1.4\r\n\t-Crit % Multiplier: 18.0\r\n\t-Crit Damage: 7\r\n\t-Casts invisibility for 20 seconds\r\n-Ultimate Bound Dagger\r\n\t-Requires: Mystic Binding, Conjuration 80\r\n\t-Damage: 14\r\n\t-Speed: 1.5\r\n\t-Crit % Multiplier: 20.0\r\n\t-Crit Damage: 9\r\n\t-Casts invisibility for 40 seconds\r\n\r\nBow Growth:\r\n*Speed refers to draw speed\r\n-Growing Bound Bow\r\n\t-Requires: Default\r\n\t-Dmg: 13\r\n\t-Speed: 1.1\r\n-Evolved Bound Bow\r\n\t-Requires: Mystic Binding, Conjuration 20\r\n\t-Damage: 16\r\n\t-Speed: 1.1\r\n\t-Crit % Multiplier: 5.0\r\n\t-Crit Damage: 7\r\n\t-Stagger: 0.5\r\n\t-Casting becomes silent (across succeeding evolutions)\r\n-Mighty Bound Bow\r\n\t-Requires: Mystic Binding, Conjuration 40\r\n\t-Damage: 19\r\n\t-Speed: 1.2\r\n\t-Crit % Multiplier: 10.0\r\n\t-Crit Damage: 8\r\n\t-Stagger: 0.8\r\n\t-Adds paralysis on crit (across succeeding evolutions)\r\n\t-Fortifies Sneak 20%\r\n-Rising Bound Bow\r\n\t-Requires: Mystic Binding, Conjuration 60\r\n\t-Damage: 25\r\n\t-Speed: 1.5\r\n\t-Crit % Multiplier: 14.0\r\n\t-Crit Damage: 9\r\n\t-Stagger: 1.1\r\n\t-Adds paralysis on crit (across succeeding evolutions)\r\n\t-Fortifies Sneak 25%\r\n-Ultimate Bound Bow\r\n\t-Requires: Mystic Binding, Conjuration 80\r\n\t-Damage: 28\r\n\t-Speed: 2.1\r\n\t-Crit % Multiplier: 18.0\r\n\t-Crit Damage: 11\r\n\t-Fortifies Sneak 35%\r\n\r\n-==Other mods==-\r\nCheck out my mods: \r\nSpell Combos\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23882\r\nEvolving Bound Weapons\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22177\r\nMRECO - Magic Related Enchantments to Clothing Only\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23096\r\nElemental Blade Effects\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23502\r\n\r\n-===Credits===-\r\n-[url=\\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12087\\\"]Urwy for the weapon meshes/textures[/url]\r\n-[url=\\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19462\\\"]jsnider193 for the other weapon meshes/textures[/url]\r\n-I used [url=\\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6365\\\"]Sunnie\\'s Tracer Arrows for the blueswirl.dds[/url]\r\n-Leazer\\'s [url=\\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10197\\\"]Bound Armor mod[/url] for the inspiration (though we\\'ve never really spoken)\r\n-Bethesda for the game",
