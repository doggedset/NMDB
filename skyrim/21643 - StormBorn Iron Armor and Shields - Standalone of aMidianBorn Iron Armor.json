  "descriptionHtml": "Standalone of CaBaL120\\'s beautiful retexture aMidianBorn Iron Armor.  \r\n\r\n[img]http://i1162.photobucket.com/albums/q524/exraycatt/stormborn2.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nUPDATE 8/5/12: added replacer versions of armor and shields if anyone wants to use it as a replacer as well.  For original replacer version go to:\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19340]aMidianBorn Iron and Banded Iron Armor[/url]\r\n\r\nAlso, I would ask that if you like either the standalone or replacer versions of this armor, that you endorse CaBaL120\\'s aMidianBorn Iron Armor set since he deserves the credit\r\n\r\nThis is a standalone set of iron armor including new Iron Shield and Banded Iron Shields.  The set has the protective stats of approximately Orcish Armor.  It can be acquired by smithing it at the forge.  You will need to have the \\\"Advanced Armors\\\" perk in order to forge it.  It can also be improved at the workbench.\r\n\r\nForging StormBorn Iron is a tradition handed down through generations to the sons of Skyrim.  It not only uses iron but also steel and silver in order to get it\\'s more metallic look and sheen.  Due to its unique forging process, it also provides superior protection to regular iron and steel, and has been said to be as or more effective than Orcish armor in battle.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of credit for this mod goes to CaBaL120 who did all the work retexturing the iron armor.  Exray Catt added the shields.  You also need to check out CaBaL\\'s other armor sets including the original:\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19340]aMidianBorn Iron and Banded Iron Armor[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18272]aMidianBorn Steel Armor[/url]\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20792]aMidianBorn Steel Plate Armor[/url]\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\n1) Use NMM\r\nor\r\n2) MANUAL: drop the \\\"data\\\" folder in your Skyrim folder and activate the .esp\r\n\r\nUNINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\n1) Use NMM\r\nor\r\n2) MANUAL: delete the .esp and the \\\"Stormborniron\\\" folders from data\\\\textures\\\\armor and from data\\\\meshes\\\\armor\r\n\r\nKNOWN CONFLICTS:\r\nThere shouldn\\'t be any since this is a standalone but if someone encounters one please let me know.\r\n\r\nKNOWN BUGS:\r\nNone at the moment\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\nCaBaL120 who put an enormous amount of work and beautiful detail into the iron armor set, and all credit goes to him for the work and for allowing me to convert this into a standalone and upload it here on the Nexus\r\n\r\nNexus staff and community\r\nBethesda\r\nPhotoshop\r\nNiftools team\r\nand as always, Bellyache for getting me into Photoshop and modding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
