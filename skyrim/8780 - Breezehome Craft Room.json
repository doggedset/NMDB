  "descriptionHtml": "The Breezehome in Whiterun is pretty good since it\\'s so close to the teleport. As you teleport to Whiterun you\\'re only few steps away from it, so I thought why not add a new extra room that will contain all the crafting tools (smelter, forge etc.) as well as some other stuff such as a bed, chest, possibly even a special merchant. Still a work in progress.\r\n\r\nAn extra Breezehome room that contains all the tools needed for crafting as well as some additional things. Still a work in progress. \r\n\r\nCurrent version = 1.0\r\n\r\nVersion 0.9b brings the Teleportation Scroll! The Merchant in the room sells the scroll. The scroll will teleport you back to the Breezehome Craft Room when used. \r\n\r\nPossible bug: For some reason when I was testing all of this, a bunch of random NPCs appeared in the room through the door, but eventually, they all left and never came back. So make sure to keep a save handy, just in case if they do not leave. Report bugs if you find any please. Still haven\\'t figured out why did they appear.\r\n\r\nAlso available on Steam workshop if anyone wants it there.\r\n\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=9103\r\n\r\nHow to install:\r\n\r\nDownload the files and extract it.\r\nCopy the files to your \\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data folder\r\nStart up Skyrim, click Data and make sure that BreezehomeCraftRoom.esp is checked.\r\n\r\n",
