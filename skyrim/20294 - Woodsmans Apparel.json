  "descriptionHtml": "This will add a \\\\\\\"Woodsman\\\\\\'s Apparel\\\\\\\" set to your game.\r\n\r\nThe Woodman\\\\\\'s Apparel set is a full set of light armor with the same stats as Leather, meant to look as plain hunting clothes. It will work on all races and with all relevant light armor perks, and is fully upgradeable. Male only at present.\r\n\r\nI created this set to use with my Bosmer ranger chacacter, and it is intended to be used with similar characters. It probably won\\\\\\'t look good on a bigger, Two-Handed Master Nord ;)\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION :\r\n\r\nTo install, drop the contents of the archive into your \\\\\\\"Data\\\\\\\" folder and check the .esp under \\\\\\\"Data Files\\\\\\\"  when you launch the game.\r\n\r\nNOTES : \r\n\r\n-This is my very first Mod for Skyrim, so please forgive me for any beginner\\\\\\'s mistakes I might have made.\r\n\r\n-No female version at the moment, and I doubt there\\\\\\'ll ever be one, unless someone comes up with a useable mesh. Do not attempt to wear this set on a female character, weird results may occur as a consequence of my \r\n\r\nfumbling around during development.\r\n\r\nADVICE :\r\n\r\nAnybody venturing into the deep forests of Skyrim to hunt should make sure to have enough weight-carrying gear to bring back all the loot that awaits them. Additionally, all the extra equipment will give them that special \\\\\\\"hunter on the prowl\\\\\\\" look the ladies of Whiterun dig so much. I strongly recommend you head over to http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16438 and get your gear on.\r\n\r\nCREDITS :\r\n\r\nRahman530 - For the hood models\r\nBethesda\r\nCreation kit\r\nNifskope\r\n\r\nCHANGELOG :\r\n\r\n1.0 : Initial release",
