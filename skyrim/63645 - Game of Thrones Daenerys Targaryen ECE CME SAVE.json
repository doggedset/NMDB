  "descriptionHtml": "This is a character I created using enhanced character edit of everyone&#39;s favourite Khaleesi Daenerys Taragaryen. She will take up slot 4 of your CME saves (though this can be changed through renaming).\r<br />\r<br />If you want your Khaleesi to look the exact same as mine you will need:\r<br />SG female texture renewal\r<br />SG hair 200+\r<br />Eyes if Perfection\r<br />UNP\r<br />\r<br />If you want the famous Dany wedding dress you will need a mod called Yes Its a Dress that is not available on the nexus and will require a little bit of searching.\r<br />\r<br />Thank You and Enjoy",
