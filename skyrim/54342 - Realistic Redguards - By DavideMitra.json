  "summary": "Now, most of the vanilla named male Redguards will wear their traditional clothes and, sometimes, also a scimitar. The mod also changes Amren&#39;s Family Sword to an ordinary scimitar. Pratically, more immersion for Redguard NPCs, that, in vanilla, looked the same as the other human races (except for their skin, of course).",

In fact, none of them was wearing Hammerfell traditional clothes and weapons. They did look anything but not Redguards.\r<br />The goal of this mod is to make Redguards proud of their culture and traditions. Most male Redguards will wear traditional clothes and, sometimes, will also carry a scimitar.\r<br />Not every male is covered by this project: for example, Redguard farmers will continue to wear their specific clothes, because the Hammerfell garb doesn&#39;t fit with the peasant work.\r<br />Most women are not covered by this project: that&#39;s because the Hammerfell garb is not female-friendly.[/SIZE][/B][/FONT]\r<br />\r<br />This mod also brings you another small in-game change: Amren&#39;s Family Sword has been replaced with a scimitar. Why should an Hammerfell family have a Nordic family sword instead of an Hammerfell one?&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br /> \r<br />[B][FONT=Comic Sans MS][/FONT][/B]\r<br />[COLOR=#FF0000][FONT=Impact][SIZE=6][B][CENTER]- WARNINGS -[/CENTER][/B][/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR]\r<br />[heading][/heading]\r<br />[*][B][FONT=Comic Sans MS][SIZE=4]I did some testing. It shouldn&#39;t happen. But, should you encounter some naked Redguards, here&#39;s what you have to do: go to a cell where there are no edited Redguard (for instance, inside of your home) and wait several days (30 should be enough). AI will reset and the new clothes will be correctly assigned to the edited NPCs. This procedure might be useful after the installation but also after the uninstallation of my mod.[/SIZE][/FONT][/B][B][FONT=Comic Sans MS][/FONT][/B][line][B][FONT=Comic Sans MS][/FONT][/B]\r<br />[*][B][FONT=Comic Sans MS][SIZE=4]The mod has been already cleaned with TES5Edit: it is 100% safe to use&#33; ;)[/SIZE][/FONT][/B]\r<br />[heading] [/heading]\r<br />[heading] [/heading]\r<br />[heading] [/heading]\r<br />[COLOR=#FF0000][FONT=Impact][SIZE=6][B][CENTER]- IF YOU WANT, CHECK MY OTHER REDGUARD PROJECT -[/CENTER][/B][/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54162/?]\r<br />[CENTER][FONT=Comic Sans MS][B][SIZE=5]HOUSE OF THE REDGUARD[/SIZE][/B][/FONT][/CENTER]\r<br />[/url]\r<br />[CENTER][img]http://static-4.nexusmods.com/15/images/110/2677524-1400573522.jpg[/img][/CENTER]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54162/?]\r<br />[CENTER][FONT=Comic Sans MS][B][SIZE=5]HOUSE OF THE REDGUARD[/SIZE][/B][/FONT][/CENTER]\r<br />[/url]",
