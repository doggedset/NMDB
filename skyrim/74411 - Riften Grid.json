[b]By Riften Grid[/b], Honeyside is ready for you to move in. You still need the key which also will unlock my other mods in Riften. All new houses/homes have new entrances and cells. They will not conflict with any of the vanilla houses or cells.\r<br />The exterior is dressed; [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12861/?]Landscaped_Honeyside[/url] by [b]Ohiogramps[/b]Â  makes the outer area more welcome.\r<br />\r<br />2. [b]Riften Grid[/b] connects [b]Honeyside[/b], [b]The Player&#39;s Lair[/b] and [b]The Player&#39;s Temple[/b].\r<br />You can enter the Grid from the Honeyside basement and enter [b]The Lair[/b] through a sewer.\r<br />\r<br />3. [b]The Player&#39;s Lair[/b] is actually a large place to live for your followers. A cook and two prospective companions are living in there. They visit the market every day during the opening hours and return to The Lair to dine in the evening. \r<br />From The Lair you have 3 exits: \r<br />-[b]Exterior Riften[/b] under the Honeyside Terrace, which is now equipped with a larger dock and a ship and some other naval objects to stay in style with the needs of a Thane.\r<br />-[b]Riften&#39;s lower level docks[/b], beside the Riften Beggar&#39;s Row entrance.\r<br />-[b]Riften Player Temple[/b] with some beds and a longtable for your companions. Exit also to the backyard of Riftweald Manor, Mercer Frey&#39;s House.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda Softworks for creating wonderous games.\r<br />Thanks a lot to my friends on the nexusmods.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/color]",
