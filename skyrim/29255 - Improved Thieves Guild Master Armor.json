  "summary": "Thieves Guild Master armor with improved stats",
  "descriptionHtml": "A few improvements to the Thieves Guild Master armor obtained from restoring the Thieves Guild to its former glory.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cuirass now gives you 100 extra carry instead of 50 and also gives you 100% health regeneration rate.\r\n\r\nThe helmet improves bow damage by 40% and allows breathing underwater.\r\n\r\nThe gloves improve pickpocket by 30% and increase one handed damage by 30%.\r\n\r\nThe boots improve sneaking by 30% and give you 50 points to stamina.\r\n\r\nThe Amulet of Articulation will now always be given as the best model instead of having random stat levels.\r\n\r\nThe armor also has the magic \\'glow\\' effect to it now.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is basically all the best bits of the Nightingale armor, Ancient Shrouded DB armor and Guild Master armor with a few small buffs thrown in.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve also increased armor slightly on all pieces and added a set bonus to make them a bit more feasible to wear until the endgame.\r\n\r\nI like the look of the armor and wanted to keep it, but didn\\'t like the setup on it. Also, it does take a bit of work to get hold of, so it\\'s not really a freebie.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere shouldn\\'t be any compatibility issues with this mod and it will upgrade the armor even if you\\'ve already got it, but you might have to re-equip it if you\\'re wearing it already.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n\r\nAdded v1.1 - slight bugfix (amulet giving wrong value) and added +30 armor matching set bonus.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdded v1.2 - bugfix and altered cuirass to give +health regen instead of +health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
