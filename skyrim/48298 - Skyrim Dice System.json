Enjoy&#33;\r<br />http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/1273237-wanting-a-more-challenging-gameplay-for-skyrim/\r<br />\r<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\r<br />\r<br />Be sure to see the &#39;How it Works&#39; section below\r<br />\r<br />- Introduction:\r<br />\r<br />Have you ever played or heard of adventure games where you had to roll dice to determine your fate? hanging on to the slender thread of hope&#33; Like the Epic closing to Gladiator, where you really want Russel Crowe, but everything in your bones tells you that he is on his way out, welcome to the world of dice&#33; ... but really the point is, dice are unpredictable, besides all your attempts to wish them otherwise&#33; (and yes, they will defy you&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />Well, i am happy to say that this is not nearly as dire as all that, as Skyrim&#39;s faithful dragons will already happily see to your demise, \r<br />This system only aims to hinder you a bit more in your travels, adding some extra obstacles along your chosen path to glory. unpredictable things as they were, which only the dice can decide.\r<br />\r<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\r<br />\r<br />- How it Works: \r<br />\r<br />Please Note: This is in no way a regular mod that you add to Skyrim, this is a dice system, which uses real and actual dice.\r<br />You would have to be honest with yourself and eliminate or restrict things when necessary.\r<br />\r<br />All you need is a six-sided dice to get you started (and preferably a dice cup)\r<br />- Roll the dice when the &#39;Events&#39; occur on the chart\r<br />- Check for results on the given table (Higher numbers yield better results)\r<br />- Make any necessary adjustments & Continue playing Skyrim\r<br />(in some cases the dice numbers are used individually, but all is explained in each &#39;Event&#39;)\r<br />\r<br />There are only five &#39;Events&#39; to that act as triggers, in total, so as to keep it simple and easy\r<br />\r<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\r<br />\r<br />- The System:\r<br />\r<br />-- Lvl up (roll for two separate results)\r<br />1st Roll\r<br />(4-6) &gt;&gt; upgrade any skill tree you choose\r<br />(1-3) &gt;&gt; can only upgrade a lesser skill tree\r<br />\r<br />2nd Roll\r<br />(4-6) &gt;&gt; choose between health, stamina or magic\r<br />(1-3) &gt;&gt; use one with lowest number\r<br />\r<br />-- Leaving City\r<br />(4-6) &gt;&gt; you choose destination\r<br />(1-3) &gt;&gt; re-roll dice\r<br />- This number is the direction to a city you must travel\r<br />- Pick the city furthest away\r<br />(note: use your own discretion for the results)\r<br />1 - NW, 2 - N, 3 - NE, 4 - E, 5 -SE, 6 - SW\r<br />\r<br />-- Selling Items (roll when entering city)\r<br />(4-6) &gt;&gt; Trade as much as you desire\r<br />(1-3) &gt;&gt; Trade with only one merchant\r<br />\r<br />-- Player Death\r<br />(4-6) &gt;&gt; you choose a weapon/armor to discard\r<br />(1-3) &gt;&gt; re-roll dice \r<br />this number is how many items you must discard\r<br />only weapons and armor can be discarded\r<br />and one weapon/armor must be a worn item\r<br />\r<br />PS. After play-testing, i found the Player Death penalty too much\r<br />here is the revised version, \r<br />Please note: i must still update the download files with these changes\r<br />\r<br />-- Player Death\r<br />(4-6) &gt;&gt; you are safe, no penalty\r<br />(1-3) &gt;&gt; re-roll dice \r<br />1-2: discard 1 item, 3-4: discard 2 items, 5-6: discard 3 items\r<br />- Only weapons and armor can be discarded in this manner\r<br />- They may be worn or inventory items\r<br />(note: if you keep on dying during the same combat, you only get penalized once)\r<br />\r<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\r<br />\r<br />- Why i did this:\r<br />\r<br />Just trying to do my small part in giving back to the amazing modding community, which make Skyrim such a fantastic place to be&#33;\r<br />\r<br />You might call me strange if you will, but there is a certain thrill factor behind rolling dice which has always allured me, and the higher the risks, the greater the rewards xD\r<br />\r<br />i was the Dungeon Master for me and my friends D&D group, so i have read and used many sets of rules before. This system is more inclined towards the later adventure books ... does &#39;Fighting Fantasy&#39; ring a bell? (no not &#39;Final&#39; Fantasy ... &#39;Fighting&#39; Fantasy, by Steve Jackson&#33;)\r<br />These had really great and simple rules, yet they really packed a decent punch, and you felt them good each and every time&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The good news is this mod is guaranteed to not harm your computer, \r<br />unless you get a little manic when rolling, and a stray dice ends up cracking your computer monitor xD\r<br />(don&#39;t forget to bill me)\r<br />\r<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\r<br />\r<br />- Final Thoughts: \r<br />\r<br />Of course this system is highly flexible, and these variables can be suited to your personal taste, it can further be extended to magic and thievery systems alike\r<br />\r<br />Let me know what you think, your feedback is welcome :)\r<br />\r<br />(Tip: only one dice is needed, but i recommend using two different color dice if you can. At times only one dice roll is need, at other times a re-roll is needed, which makes 2 dice. But simple fact is that two dice just roll better together ... and don&#39;t forget the dice-cup :)\r<br />\r<br />Many thanks for your downloads and comments&#33;",
