(Stats in image section)\r<br />Everything except arrows/capes is upgradeable.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://media.moddb.com/cache/images/members/1/532/531406/thumb_620x2000/important.png[/img]\r<br />NON ARGONIAN/KHAJIIT (you can wear it on female characters, but the armor won&#39;t fit properly)\r<br />(I&#39;m not looking forward to make it for anyone else)\r<br />\r<br />Helmet is actually a circlet, so the hair is visible.\r<br />Sword is set as a double handed axe, hence the animations fit better the concept.\r<br />\r<br />Requires Dawnguard to craft arrows.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://media.moddb.com/cache/images/members/1/532/531406/thumb_620x2000/credits.png[/img]\r<br />I&#39;m not a good character creator or screenshot maker so if I can beg you, try to make some nice screens and post them here. You&#39;ll of course receive your credits here. \r<br />\r<br />Big thanks to NWaldinger for keeping me motivated&#33;\r<br />I used the ApachiiSkyHair for screens and also RealVisionENB\r<br />Thanks to renthal311 for his awesome shots.",
