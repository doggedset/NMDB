  "descriptionHtml": "Pretty simple. I didn\\'t like that you can\\'t temper / improve the Shield of Ysgramor, unlike some other artifacts. Made it so that as long as you have the Arcane Smithing perk and some ebony, you can improve it. Nothing else was changed. I liked the enchantments, just not the strength.\r\n\r\n____\r\nIncompatibilities: \r\n\r\nProbably anything else that changes the stats of the Shield, but I\\'m not really sure of that.\r\n\r\nIf you do have any issues, let me know and I\\'ll see what I can do to solve them.",
