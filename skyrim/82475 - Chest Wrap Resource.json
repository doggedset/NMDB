  "descriptionHtml": "My brother has finally agreed to play skyrim modded, so I am making a few trans things for him.\r<br />\r<br />This is just a modder&#39;s resource though. It is meant to be used for transmasculine characters but it could also be used in a bandage mod for upper torso injuries.\r<br />\r<br />I added weighting and male/female support so lets see if that works. The mesh uses the vanilla arm bandage texture, so it is compatible with retextures (Rustic Clothing is a good one).\r<br />\r<br />The chest bandage is fit to the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2488/?]Sundracon[/url]/vanilla body and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/44979/]CNHF v2.5[/url] so go download those or risk purple panties&#33;\r<br />I will consider fitting the mesh to different body types but if you suggest something ridiculous like the manga body shape you will be ignored/struck down by Shor (I mean I like boobs as much as the next girl but too much of a good thing aint good)\r<br />\r<br />I would suggest using a mod that lets you use separate meshes for the player character, but can&#39;t really recommend any at the moment...\r<br />\r<br />Big thanks to blender and gimp for not charging me money :P\r<br />Big thanks to the Bodyslide/Outfit Studio team for simplifying the fitting process.\r<br />Also big thanks to the niftools team for being awesome.\r<br />Biggest thanks of all to my baby brother who is so strong and brave ily\r<br />\r<br />Disclaimer: Please please please DONT use bandages to bind there are special binders specifically for that purpose. Bandages can cause difficulty breathing and breast harm. Unfortunately it is highly unlikely that chest binders exist in the TES universe. In our universe, however, chest binders are about &#036;30 but you only need one if you intend to wash it frequently. Feel free to pm me if you have any questions about this.",
