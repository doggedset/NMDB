Check out this mod instead:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37347//?]Customizable Camera by Arindel[/url]\r\nIt provides far greater ease of use than mines![/size][/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHi, I personally don\\'t like the \\\"over the shoulder\\\" camera when playing a non-fps, because it just makes walking around feel odd. I prefer it just right over my character\\'s head, so I made this ini tweak for myself. But I figured some other people would like the changes as well, so I went ahead and uploaded it.\r\n\r\nIt also doesn\\'t change the camera\\'s position when sheathing and unsheathing your weapons, so it becomes much less annoying.\r\n\r\nI also put some easy instructions in the file to show you how to customize the camera for yourself.",
