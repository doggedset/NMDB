  "descriptionHtml": "[u]DISCLAIMER:This mod is a WIP:All the content included in each version is complete as it is.This is not a half-finished mod.It&#39;s a compilation of player housing options.With each new version I will be adding more location for the player to call home.But as version 1 this file il completely playable as it is.\r<br />\r<br />ALL DLCs ARE REQUIRED.\r<br />\r<br />[/u]VERSION 1:This version includes 5 new player houses.The theme they follow is the same.A small farmhouse/cabin.\r<br />This 5 houses are located in each of the following holds:Whiterun(Frostwood Farm),Eastmarch(Northview Farm),Haafingar(Archwind Farm),Rift(Amberleaf Cabin) and The Reach(Juniper Hill Farm).\r<br />Each of this houses contains the following features:\r<br />-Full crafting (Smithing,Alchemy,Enchanting) furnitures\r<br />-An oven\r<br />-A custom butter churn that is actually a crafting station (turn 1 jug of milk into 1 butter)\r<br />-Cooking pot\r<br />-Hearthfire&#39;s planting soils on the outside (The number varies from house to house)\r<br />-Grain mill\r<br />-A mannequin\r<br />-2 a couple of weapon racks (in 4 of the houses i did not include weapon plaques since they didn&#39;t fit the humble mood of the house)\r<br />-2 Beds\r<br />-A bookshelf\r<br />-All the houses are at a short walk from the major cities \r<br />-Full navmesh (inside and outside)\r<br />-Livestock on the outside (wich appears only after you purchase the house)\r<br />EXCEPTIONS:Amberleaf cabin includes a working fish hatchery and boat travel to Riften,Archwind farms has three apiary(ies?) on the back.\r<br />\r<br />HOW TO GET THIS 5 HOUSES? Outside of this five house you&#39;ll find a note (stuck with a dagger near the front door) which will tell you were you need to go in order to purchase the house.Once in the right place(one of the 5 jarl palaces of the above mentioned cities),you will find a deed which you&#39;ll have to sign (activate) in order to purchase the house.(the script comes from Bert&#39;s tutorials and modders resources).\r<br />There is no quest related to the house purchase so you can look at the image section to see the location of each house.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE:This mod was cleaned with tes5edit.\r<br />\r<br />Version 2:will include houses in the remaining holds OR in Solstheim OR will focus on making the various guilds headquarters more useful as player houses.You decide.Vote in  the comment section.",
