  "descriptionHtml": "----------------------------------------------------------\r<br />Heavy Elven Armor\r<br />----------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />If you like the look of Elven armor, but you&#39;d prefer for it to be heavy instead of light, this mod is for you&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Adds Heavy Elven Armor to the Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun, where it is sold by Elrindir.  Depending on which version of the mod you are using, the armor may also be worn by some Thalmor NPCs.\r<br />\r<br />This new armor can be improved with refined moonstone.  The Elven Smithing perk will allow you to improve it more, but the player cannot craft this armor.\r<br />\r<br />The stats (weight, value, and armor) match those of Dwarven armor.\r<br />\r<br />Visual differences: Like Jahga&#39;s retex, the armor looks cleaner and gleams more, and has scale mail in some of the places where the original has leather.  However, the scale has been changed to be darker and more golden, the cloth of the belt has been darkened, and the cloth between the legs (which is scale in the original) has been changed to plate.  The helm and shield are unchanged.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is not a replacer--it will not change the existing elven armor in the game.\r<br />\r<br />----------------------------------------------------------\r<br />Credits\r<br />----------------------------------------------------------\r<br />The texture used in this mod is based off of the gorgeous work by Jahga/Kraxxuz: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10756\r<br />\r<br />The work of editing the textures and all other work to create the mod was done by Deandra aka Merilia.
