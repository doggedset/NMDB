It is just south of Markath. See screenshots. This is a functional WIP since i\\'m still pretty new at the CK. Feedback and ideas on how to proceed is welcome. This also has the ability to function as a player home if desired. It has all forging tools, crafting, alchemy and enchantment table, cooking. Has mannequins and trophy mounts. Also has several vendors for all your buying/ selling needs. And its fully navmeshed for all followers.\r\n   Only conflict should be if someone else edited the same worldspace as me. Should be pretty slim i would think as its pretty off the beaten path.\r\n\r\nPlans:\r\nkey for entrance\r\nmore rooms, ideas?\r\nmore ncps\r\nquest? maybe...",
