  "descriptionHtml": "A port of one of my favourite swords from The Witcher 2, the Arbitrator. Unfortunately although the level of detail in most assets in TW2 is a step above those in Skyrim, the same cannot be said for the weapons, probably due to only being seen from 3rd person view. Still, a number of the weapons have some nice designs that I consider worth porting.\r\n\r\nCHANGELOG:\r\n1.0 to 1.1\r\n- Reduced blinding scabbard specular.\r\n- Tweaked sword sizes to be slightly smaller.\r\n- Changed stats. The swords now weigh the same as their glass equivalents, have the same crit damage as daedric and have base damage in between ebony and daedric. They swing a bit faster than the vanilla weapons and the longsword has a slightly longer reach.\r\n\r\nVISUAL FEATURES:\r\n- Mesh has been subdivided and smoothed (both automatically and by hand) to somewhat alleviate the low-poly look.\r\n- Textures have been enhanced a little bit. Diffuse had its contrast altered and shading deepened, along with the standard resize + sharpening. Mask and normal map alpha channel were altered and the normal map intensified to try and bring out some of the smaller details.\r\n- Scabbards and blood effects.\r\n- A number of recolours for the hand-grip are included. Either change the texture path in Nifskope or rename the dds files to use.\r\n\r\nGAMEPLAY FEATURES:\r\n- Two new craftable, temperable weapons: Arbitrator Longsword (1H) and Arbitrator Greatsword (larger model, 2H).\r\n- Stats roughly equivalent to Deadric sword/greatsword. Classified as silver (yes I know it\\'s a steel sword in TW2).\r\n- Requires Deadric smithing to craft. Type \\\"help arbitrator\\\" (no quotes) into the console to get the IDs for the player.additem command if you don\\'t want to go through this.\r\n\r\nOPTIONAL FILES:\r\n- Two of the optional files will add a second scabbard + silver Witcher\\'s sword as visual decoration when equipped.  Requires Hucifer\\'s \\\"The Witcher 2 - Geralt Light Armor and Witcher Swords\\\" ( skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6006/ ). Install over the main file, note that if you don\\'t use a skeleton that places 1-Handed weapons on the back you may not want to overwrite \\\"Arbitrator 1H.nif\\\" as doing so will put two swords at your hip. It\\'s a matter of personal preference though.\r\n\r\n- Optional files to make either the extra scabbard version or the main file use the textures from \\\"Witcher 2 swords HD\\\" ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13552/ ) by Suhoi72. That mod is highly recommended as the textures look a lot better, though they are performance intensive. I recommend resaving them with DXT compression (1 for diffuse/mask, 5 or 3 for normal map).\r\n\r\nI may be porting some more W2 weapons as time goes on. If someone wants to do a proper HD retexture/remesh be my guest.",
