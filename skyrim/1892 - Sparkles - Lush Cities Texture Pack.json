  "descriptionHtml": "[color=orange](Will be adding these updates to a new section in my mods called \\\"Changelog\\\". Keep an eye out) Update! We\\'re now partnered with the talented [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=3148513]Tytanis[/url], creator of some truly phenominal pre-Creation Kit stuff! Tytanis is most widely known for his great work on the [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1601]Tytanis - The Ultimate Mod - Crafts - Spells - Items - MORE[url] mod.[/color]\r\n\r\n[center][img=]http://img210.imageshack.us/img210/8074/sparkleslogosmall.png[/img]\r\nThis mod can be used alone, but it\\'s best when combined with:\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=521]Sparkles - Lush Environments[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2515]Sparkles - Lush Dungeons[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1088]Sparkles - Lush Creatures[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=845]Sparkles - Better Clutter[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1636]Sparkles - Better Characters and NPCs[/url][/center]\r\n\r\n[u][b][color=#5078D4][size=3]Introduction (i.e Gloating Space)[/size][/color][/b][/u]\r\nLet\\'s face it, the cities in Skyrim are boring and dreary! They look like something out of a Steven King horror film, and in a world such as Skyrim this should not be so.\r\n\r\nThis texture pack will bring new life to the streets you walk, the buildings you visit, and even the inner-plant growths within the walls. It completely reshapes every city, town and camp in Skyrim, effectively bringing in the \\\"Wow\\\" factor.\r\n\r\nThere are versions here for everyone! From realists to fantasy lovers, you should be happy by the end of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b][color=#5078D4][size=3]What does this mod change?[/size][/color][/b][/u]\r\n\r\n[b]A.[/b] Cities, towns and camps.\r\n[b]B.[/b] Buildings and structures.\r\n[b]C.[/b] Plant life in and around cities and towns.\r\n[b]D.[/b] Various decals, banners and signs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b][color=#5078D4][size=3]Which file is for me?[/size][/color][/b][/u]\r\n\r\n[u][b]==25% Contrast==[/b][/u]\r\nDetails in cities will begin to show, making them have greater depth and offering you more immersion. Colors are not changed in this version of the mod. Use if you like the cold, bleak feel of Skyrim, but still want improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]==30% Sat, 25% Con (Recommended version)==[/b][/u]\r\nWith contrast for depth, and saturation for color, this version adds new dimensions to your cities. It will brighten up the colors to a more realistic level while adding the ideal amount of contrast. This is the perfect lush balance and is highly recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]==50% Sat, 25% Con==[/b][/u]\r\nMore depth, colors are super lush and vibrant. For those of you who like fantasy realms.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]==30% Saturation ==[/b][/u]\r\nThis version is as close to realistic color increases as you\\'re going to get. It gives your world a slight color boost that\\'s just noticeable enough to appreciate.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]50% Saturation[/b][/u]\r\nThe same basic concept of 30% Saturation, only it makes the color boost more noticeable.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b][color=#5078D4][size=3]Installation[/size][/color][/b][/u]\r\nThis mod will not replace any default texture files themselves. This pack will not replace any default Skyrim textures. You may visit your local blacksmith a LOT more.\r\n\r\n[b]1.[/b] Unzip this ZIP folder into your Skyrim \\\"Data\\\" directory. If you unzipped this folder into another place, just make sure the \\\"textures\\\" folder gets put into the Skyrim \\\"Data\\\" directory. On Vista, the Data folder is located here: C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\r\n[b]2.[/b] If you are asked to merge folders or overwrite files, press OK or YES.\r\n\r\n[b]3.[/b] Start the game, take a walk through the cities and be sure to buy some yummy cakes.\r\n\r\n[b]4.[/b] If you like it, endorse it. The more people who know, the better it becomes!\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b][color=#5078D4][size=3]Uninstallation[/size][/color][/b][/u]\r\n\r\n[b]2.[/b] Navigate to your Skyrim Data directory, where you installed this pack to.\r\n\r\n[b]3.[/b] Go to \\\"textures\\\", and delete or rename \\\"architecture\\\" to something else. This will uninstall the mod, giving you back your dark city-scapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b][color=#5078D4][size=3]Compatibility[/size][/color][/b][/u]\r\nThis pack should be compatible with all mods except other texture mods that use the \\\"actors\\\" folder. If you\\'re using mods that use the \\\"character\\\" folder, those should work just fine (even though they\\'re in \\\"actors\\\"). Of course, if you know what you\\'re doing, you can mix and match right?\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b][color=#5078D4][size=3]Injectors Vs. Texture Packs[/size][/color][/b][/u]\r\nThere\\'s not much to say on this subject, so I\\'ll just give you something to chew on. Injectors change the actual settings of the game, making it more lush... but at a cost. It can severely impact your system\\'s performance, and is basically the same as turning your graphics up to high (Or more, depending on your injector settings).\r\n\r\nTexture packs do not change any settings in the game, but rather they take advantage of Skyrim\\'s texture system. By default, Skyrim will use a packed .BSA (a high-tech ZIP file) file to retrieve it\\'s textures. However, if you create a folder called \\\"textures\\\" in the Data folder, it will take what textures it finds there and use them instead.\r\n\r\nThe nice thing about this is that Skyrim, like Oblivion, is programmed to use textures it cannot find in your \\\"texture\\\" folder, by accessing the .BSA. So you can basically add 1 new texture if you wanted, and as long as it was correctly named, Skyrim would only change that texture in-game.\r\n\r\nI\\'m not saying injectors are bad, but they\\'re probably not the best for most people.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b][color=#5078D4][size=3]Credits and Copyrights[/size][/color][/b][/u]\r\nFor all the fact that I created this mod, it wasn\\'t as difficult as it looks. It DID take me HOURS though, so if you plan on using the re-textured files that I spent so long improving, it would be nice to see some credit.\r\n\r\nI also accept treats.",
