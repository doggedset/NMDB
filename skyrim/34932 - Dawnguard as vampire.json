  "modName": "Dawnguard as vampire",
  "summary": "Removes the annoying &#34;Get out of here, monster&#34; dialogue and allows you to continue the Dawnguard questline as vampire.",
  "descriptionHtml": "After completing the Chasing Echoes quest I returned to Castle Dawnguard... only to find I was being shunned for being a vampire&#33; While this might make sense to some(with them being vampires and all), Serana is accepted just fine after showing her good intentions. So why shouldn&#39;t this go for the player, too?\r<br />\r<br />This small mod should allow you to do just that. While it has not been tested with the first quest, every quest from then on should work just fine. \r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Clockwordbard for this trick: if you end up getting stuck after the quest &#34;A New Order&#34;, just attack someone and then either A) stealth, B) leave and come back after a few days or C) use a calm spell. Attacking them will break them from their busy state and advance the quest to the point where this mod kicks in and you can talk to them again.",
