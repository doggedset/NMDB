  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i.imgur.com/6DDmbpu.png[/img]\r<br />There was once a book I found which explained the details of how nords first came to settle in Skyrim. It was there I learnt about the fabled ruins in the Velothi mountain range. Little is known about it but some records suggest that it extends into the very depths of the mountain itself. - Wanderer\r<br />\r<br />This mod is going to take a while because the area I am creating is going to be huge, like really BIG. Voltheim is a Huge dungeon mod with a Quest that takes place inside of it, you will gain new followers and new equipment.Â ",
