  "descriptionHtml": "Name: Better Dawnguard Rewards\r\nVersion: 1.2\r\nDate: 08/25/2012\r\nAuthor: LF\r\nRequires:\r\nDawnguard\r\n\r\n1.1\r\nInitial Release\r\n\r\n1.2\r\nESP name change\r\nRecompressed\r\nDecreased armor values of almost everything except auriel shield. \r\n\r\nDetails:\r\nBoost Dawnguard reward items to roughly Daedric quality, add the missing helm, make items upgradeable.\r\nI finished Dawnguard, and in the end none of the items I worked so hard to get were better than items already in my inventory. I feel this is a recurring design issue with Bethesda products which may be intentional. The risk  vs. reward balance is not justifiable. In this case the rewards given to the player to not justify the larger risk taken to acquire them. The aim of this mod is to fix the risk/reward balance issues in Dawnguard. \r\nThere are a few mods on the nexus that already address this issue. These mods were good, but I wanted one mod to fix all of the final reward items for the various quests.  \r\n\r\nArmor affected (updated 1.2): \r\nAuriel shield: Daedric armor value +1\r\nAetherial Crown: Dragon plate-ish armor value(21), upgradeable, Light armor (crown not a full helm = light weight). \r\nAetherial Shield: Daedric Shield armor value(36), Upgradeable, Heavy armor. \r\nDawnguard Rune Shield: Daedric Armor Value -1 (35)\r\nIvory crown: Dragon scale armor value, light armor,  Added to Vyrthur’s inventory (playable!). \r\nIvory Armor (boots, gloves, chest): Matching Dragon Scale armor values.  \r\n\r\nWeapons Affected:\r\nAetherial Staff: Doubled charges. \r\nAuriel Bow: Daedric Bow Damage +1 (20), Speed 1.1 (0.1 Faster than Zephyr), Blood and bless arrows upgraded to Daedric damage. Bow enchantment has infinite charges (same as Better Auriel’s bow mod by popcorn71)\r\nDwarven enhanced crossbow: damage 25 (+3 to the vanilla stat)\r\nHarkon sword: Daedric damage 19\r\nRune Axe: Daedric Axe Damage 18\r\nRune Hammer: Daedric hammer damage 27\r\nZephyr: Daedric Bow Damage -1 (18), Speed unchanged (1.0) \r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n1.\tExtract \\'Dawnguard Rewards.esp\\' into you Skyrim data folder.\r\n2.\tStart the Skyrim Launcher and place a check mark next to \\'Dawnguard Rewards.esp\\'.\r\n3.\tPlay Skyrim.\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\nDelete \\'Dawnguard Rewards.esp\\' from your data folder.\r\n\r\nRecommended Mods: \r\nAuriels Shield Retextured by Ortiz\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22493\r\n\r\nThanks: \r\nI started working on this after using:\r\nBetter Auriels Bow by popcorn71\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22324\r\nand \r\nGZD - Ancient Falmer Crown by GrZDem\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21696\r\n\r\n \r\n",
