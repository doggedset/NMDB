  "modName": "Anshir - Youthful Argonian Follower",
  "summary": "Anshir is an aspiring young argonian adventurer you can have as a follower. He is marriageable, cannot be killed, and will not judge you if you steal, murder, and do all sorts of criminal deeds.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Anshir (pronounced An-sheer) specializes in light armor, archery, one-handed, and restoration. He is quite sneaky as well; he doesn&#39;t trigger pressure plates and he has a few helpful sneak perks such as silent roll. He won&#39;t judge you for your crimes and he&#39;ll even gladly help you perform them. He levels with your character.\r<br />\r<br />Anshir is marriageable and cannot be killed. He doesn&#39;t have the default argonian voice, he has the MaleEvenToned voice instead because I wanted him to seem younger than most of his argonian brethren. His default clothing is his hunter armor, but you can give him whatever armor you want and he&#39;ll equip it.\r<br />\r<br />Anshir can be found near the sawmill in Falkreath. \r<br />\r<br />Anshir&#39;s Inventory:\r<br />-Glass bow\r<br />-500 Glass arrows\r<br />-2 Glass swords\r<br />-1 Enchanted glass dagger\r<br />-3 Restore health potions\r<br />-2 Bottles of skooma\r<br />-1 Potion of cure disease\r<br />-1 Potion of invisibility\r<br />-Some randomly generated loot such as  gems and rings\r<br />-Miscellaneous food items \r<br />\r<br />PLEASE endorse if you like him&#33; It lets me know the mod is working properly&#33; I have tested him and he seems to work perfectly for me, however this is my very first mod so let me know if something is wrong with him and I&#39;ll do my best to fix the problem.\r<br />\r<br />*** I have the Argonian Raptor Feet mod by J Hamilton (artifex0) installed, which shows in the images. I did not make that mod I only use it. I highly recommend it&#33; ***\r<br />",
