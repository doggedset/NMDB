  "descriptionHtml": "Weapon of mass destruction&#33;&#33;&#33;   Never see another enemy, walk peacefully through dungeons collecting treasure and items, help allies without fear of friendly fire&#33;(see note 1)\r<br />Way over powered experiment, mostly just souped up Ebony Mail but kills any hostile within the cell you&#39;re in, painfully (they scream as they die :))\r<br />can be found in the Warden&#39;s chest in Helgen, the potion barrel in Helgen, the chest in your player&#39;s Home, and a few chests around the game, is also craftable at a forge with the Ebony perk.\r<br />Very handy to just keep in your inventory if you use a fast travel from indoors mod for when you get &#34;you cannot fast travel when enemies are near&#34; just put on the Armor of Death and wait for the screams to stop, then put your regular armor back on and travel.\r<br />\r<br />Note 1: for some reason if you join the Stormcloaks and you use it on their quests it kills them and they try to kill you, so it can&#39;t be used during Stormcloak quests.\r<br />\r<br />Try my other Mod - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83890/? \r<br />",
