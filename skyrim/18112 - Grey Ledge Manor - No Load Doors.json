To activate you'll need to either fast-travel in or jump the fence. Go to side door of house and on left side of door you'll see the switch. Click and  all the bars will lower. Click again and they raise up.\n<br />\n<br />The bars for the front gate will only keep enemies out if you stay outside near the gate, if you go back to house, it will unfortunately let them in. This because the cell boundary runs by the little garden and if you leave the cell with the gate, i guess the collision disappears, allowing enemies in (originally I had the bars going all along the upper fence and gate, but testing showed it didn't keep anything out once you retreat to house).  Should keep you safe though from surprise attacks. Thanks and good luck!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]vnqdkuFmNVM[/youtube] \n<br />[youtube]i7y8skifirc[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/24z3gKi][img]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4770/40411650411_98253b1701.jpg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />Heartwood Cottage is available on Nexus Only...\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20561]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20561[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/24v74LW][img]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4622/40367124602_0b72af5c27.jpg[/img]\n<br />[/url]When this mod originally came out the main problem with it was lag, since every thing--visible and invisible had to be loaded at once as well as the surrounding landscape. I made several versions in an attempt to make this house compatible with different levels of computers. Years later though, this  shouldn't be a problem with the newer, faster pc's. I played this mod with only 4GB of RAM at the time, now i have 16. It has made a big difference in the playability of this mod. Therefore, the older versions listed are probably not needed, but i've kept them available just in case. I recommend you download the main file as it has all the features listed and is the only one which I will...maybe...update. Enjoy!\n<br />\n<br />***********************************************************************************************************************************************\n<br />Grey Ledge Manor @ 1:06\n<br />[youtube]nC7rAD5webQ[/youtube] \n<br />\n<br />Recommended Mods--------\n<br />\n<br />To utilize the bookshelves, I encourage you to download Da5id's great mod \"Unlimited Bookshelves,\" if you dont already have it. Its a simple script that changes everything concerning bookshelves and storage in the game. Place just about anything on the bookshelves and other areas that i've designated as \"bookshelves.\" You can download it here:\n<br />[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=13661&amp;searchtext=]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=13661&amp;searchtext=[/url]\n<br />or the nexus version:\n<br />[url=http://]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10891.[/url]\n<br />\n<br />***********************************\n<br />\n<br />Fix for Grey Ledge Manor windows --- by Doesntcareaboutname\n<br />Some texture and unofficial patches may make the windows frosty or opaque.  \"Doesntcareaboutname\" certainly did care about this problem and came up with a fix!  Download his patch here and thank him again for me.\n<br />[color=#f1f1f1][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58833/]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58833/[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[/color]*********\n<br />Mannequins are creepy little buggers, But you can fix their erratic behavior and strange poses with this great mod:\n<br />Vanilla Mannequin Script Fix - [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10652]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10652[/url]\n<br />(may not be as necessary with new Skyrim 1.6 patch)\n<br />\n<br />********\n<br />\n<br />Trying to get your spouse to move onto the side of a cliff can be a tough sell, especially if they've got plenty of high-society friends in Solitude or Windhelm.

My advice is that when a ten ton reptile comes flying above your house...get out! \n<br />Seriously. Fight him outside in the open ground, because if you hide under the bed, he will eventually fly into your house. Dragons have no collision barriers while flying. They'll fly through anything--mountains, trees, and even buildings. All a house maker can do is try to steer them a little. So, if a dragon engages you and you stay inside the house, don’t be surprised if he sticks his head through your bedroom. Do not stay in the house!  You'll be a sitting duck....boom...roasted.\n<br />\n<br />Texture Mods--- I never had any lag while testing this and my computer sucks. However, when i installed a couple of texture packs, i did experience some lag when at a distance from the house. There is a lot of information in those two cells and a large chunk of the original house was scrapped because of this concern (a huge silo that originally housed the alchemy, enchanting room as well as a loft that housed more bookshelves and all the doomstones). This is not an empty shell of a house that ports you somewhere else. It is full of stuff, and time will tell if there is still too much. Your feedback on this would be very constructive and much appreciated. Thank you.\n<br />\n<br />Conflicts---There are no additional scripts added to the game through this mod. So, there should be no reason for it to conflict with any mods other than those that might be built on the same spot. The reason that the place is not spouse-friendly is that the script used to provide that luxury from other mods is a major point of conflict (because every house has to use the same script). \n<br />Conflict Update---- This mod may conflict with the mod:  \"The Secret of Dragonhead\" (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16197). The exit to that dungeon covers some of the Manor's estate--in particular--the outhouse (Ha!)-- However i was able to enter the dungeon with no problems, others have reported CTD's. \n<br />Thanks to Euther on Nexus for the info. \n<br />\n<br />Resource Management--- This mod adds a lot of content to a very small space, be reasonable with your computer's resources. If you are running every freaking texture pack available, ENB, FXAA, and ten zillion other mods that change everything from the color of the grass to the weather, then don't be surprised if you experience some lag with this mod. This is not necessarily the fault of this - or any other mod. It is the COMBINATION of all these things. Many many people, including myself, play this mod without any lag or drop in fps (and on probably a much crappier computer than you have). You may need to tweak your settings, and draw distances, or drop down a notch. Give the mod a chance and remember that the a.i.  is trying to render a lot of objects in a short period of time. There is a reason why every other door to a house in Skyrim takes you to an interior that only looks like the inside of a house. It's all about resources and what your cpu and the games a.i. can process.  Be realistic and patient and you can take advantage of having a house that allows you the freedom and views this one does. \n<br />\n<br />Special Thanks---------\n<br />To Eldiabs for the Modders Resource-Weapon Racks-Bookshelves-Plaques-Mannequins--\n<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11618\n<br />for saving me untold hours with this very handy resource. A modder's dream come true!\n<br />\n<br />To everyone that has downloaded this mod and endorsed it. The response has been nothing short of incredible. The most refreshing thing about this experience has been the responses in the comments section on Nexus. In particular, there have been many people which have gone out of their way to help this idiot make this house so much better. Their help, advice, enthusiasm, and in some cases, detailed walkthroughs, have made Grey Ledge Manor what it is, and it is very very much appreciated.  \n<br />\n<br />Doesntcareaboutname\n<br />vincent7valentine7\n<br />rallshew\n<br />scary666scream\n<br />Zimitry\n<br />Roderick99\n<br />Macree\n<br />Cetacean1\n<br />***Special Thanks to Mujuro and Brendan62 for  the great help on cleaning up this mod as well as suggestions to make it better\n<br />***Special Thanks to Dalter for the gray-face bug fix\n<br /> ***Special Thanks to banddadchase for the labelling suggestions.\n<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n<br />UPDATE++UPDATE++UPDATE++UPDATE\n<br />7/2/12--Version v1 fixes the 'grey-face' bug for the merchant.
