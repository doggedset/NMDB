The hair doesn\\'t clip with the sacrament armor and it doesn\\'t look like there\\'s a sparkly block on the back of her head. I added the pictures for daedric and triss just for aesthetic value. There is still a slight line on the neck, but that\\'s not possible to fix right now without the CK. Hopefully that will be addressed soon. Enjoy her as much as I will. \r\n\r\nJust sell the armor sets for gold if you want a fresh start with her because she has the regular armor and weapons obtained playing up to the start of whiterun.",
