  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/37546-1-1372072553.png[/img]\r<br />[size=4]This MOD is Created By ElPsyCongroo From Arrow and Knee Mod Team, China\r<br />Firstly, sorry for my poor English.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=7]Description[/size]\r<br />[size=4]A multi-bodyshape system providing 9 custom bodyshape slots. Allow you to change among different bodyshapes freely. You can install CBBE, UNP, UNPB, SEVENBASE, ADEC, CHSBHC and so on at the same time and change among them in the game. \r<br />It also provides a &#39;wardrobe&#39; for you to put your favourite armors in, setting the bodyshapes you want to use when wearing them. You bodyshape and textures will change to the one you set for the armor after you have it put on.\r<br />\r<br />[color=Red]This mod is for female player character only. Argonian and Khajiit is also not supported.\r<br />Custom races are possible to use with this mod but I&#39;m not sure.[/color][/size]\r<br />[color=Red]\r<br />[size=5]Please read the following contient carefully and patiently.[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=7]Feature[/size]\r<br />[size=5]1.Bodyshape Custom Slot[/size]\r<br />[size=4]This mod provide 9 new custom slots for you to put your custom bodyshapes and textures in. Adding the original bodyshape, there are totally 10 bodyshape slots to use.\r<br />[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/37546-3-1372072554.jpg[/img]\r<br />After installing the mod, load a save and there should be words like &#39;[color=Red]Original Bodyshape Saved[/color]&#39; and &#39;[color=Red]Bodyshape Loading[/color]&#39; in the corner of the screen.\r<br />\r<br />Open the MCM menu and find the config page of Bodyshape. You can change a slot on the right side and exit the menu, and the bodyshape and textures will change into your selection.\r<br />\r<br />Only one shape can be change into every time you open the MCM menu. If you have chosen a wrong slot, exit the menu and wait for the finish of the change, then choose again.\r<br />\r<br />After changing the sliders of the face with the SHOWRACEMENU, click &#39;[color=Red]Regenerate[/color]&#39; to fix the tone of your face.\r<br />If you want to change the race with the SHOWRACEMENU([color=Red]Strongly not recommended[/color]),  change back to the original shape first, and click &#39;[color=Red]Reset Origin[/color]&#39; after the race change is done.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]2.Wardrobe[/size]\r<br />[size=4]Provide 10 slots for your favourite clothes to put in. You can put the clothes or armor you are wearing in the wardrobe and set the bodyshape slot you want to use when wearing it. \r<br />When the feature is enabled, the bodyshape will change to the one you set for the armor automatically. So you can put on the clothes of UNPB or other bodyshapes else when you&#39;re using the CBBE bodyshape and the textures will not be a mess anymore.\r<br />[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/37546-4-1372072554.jpg[/img]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=5]How To Customize The Slots?[/size]\r<br />[size=4]The directories of the slots are:\r<br />Original\r<br />Meshes:Datameshesactorscharactercharacter assets\r<br />Textures:Datatexturesactorscharacterfemale\r<br />\r<br />CustomSlotX(X=1~9)\r<br />Meshes:DataMeshesBodyChangeCustomSetX\r<br />Textures:DataTexturesBodyChangeCustomSetX\r<br />\r<br />I have already put the meshes of CBBE 3.2 and UNPB in the meshes directories of CustomSet1 and CustomSet2, and SG Female Textures Renewal For CBBE and UNPB in the textures directories of them.\r<br />\r<br />For the other customsets, I have put the meshes of CBBE 3.2 in the meshes directories but I havn&#39;t prepare the textures, considering the size of the files.\r<br />\r<br />What you have to do is:\r<br />1.Prepare the Meshes of Body, hands and feet.\r<br />Prepare the [color=Red]6[/color] mesh files of the bodyshape you want to use, they are:\r<br />\r<br />FemaleBody_0.nif\r<br />FemaleBody_1.nif\r<br />FemaleHands_0.nif\r<br />FemaleHands_1.nif\r<br />FemaleFeet_0.nif\r<br />FemaleFeet_1.nif \r<br />\r<br />If you want to customize CustomSetX, you should put them in DataMeshesBodyChangeCustomSetX\r<br />\r<br />2.Prepare the textures of the bodyshape.\r<br />Prepare the [color=Red]12[/color] texture files of the bodyshape, they are:\r<br />\r<br />FemaleBody_1.dds\r<br />FemaleBody_1_msn.dds\r<br />FemaleBody_1_s.dds\r<br />FemaleBody_1_sk.dds\r<br />FemaleHands_1.dds\r<br />FemaleHands_1_msn.dds\r<br />FemaleHands_1_s.dds\r<br />FemaleHands_1_sk.dds\r<br />FemaleHead.dds\r<br />FemaleHead_msn.dds\r<br />FemaleHead_s.dds\r<br />FemaleHead_sk.dds\r<br />\r<br />TextureSets you have should have the most of them. If some of the _sk and _s is missing, you can use the textures I put in DataTexturesBodyChangeBackup\r<br />Put the 12 .dds files in DataTexturesBodyChangeCustomSetX\r<br />\r<br />3.Edit The Head Mesh\r<br />Head mesh is a specail exception. It must be edit before using in order to match the colour of the body. I have already prepared an edited head mesh in each customset&#39;s mesh folder. If you want to use your own, follow the steps below:\r<br />A.Put the head mesh(femalehead.nif) you want to use in DataMeshesBodyChangeCustomSetX\r<br />\r<br />B.Edit the .nif file as I show you in the picture below with Nifskope.
