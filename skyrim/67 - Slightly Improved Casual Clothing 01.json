  "descriptionHtml": "I made a screenshot with this clothing but after looking at it again I realised how odd the clothing look compared to the rest. My bad I ended up liking to wear casual clothing while in town (crafting, talking, ...) so I tried to improve the texture a little bit.\r\n\r\nActually I never did any texture work before so they are surely not really impressive but I can at least look at the dress now. Maybe someone like it until better things are released.\r\n\r\nTexture size was increased from 512 to 2048 (AlphaMap from 512 to 1024 - did a new one from skretch and merged it with the existing). Also I repainted some parts by hand - but remember I\\'m not really used to it, so \\\"by hand\\\" may sounds better than it actually looks.\r\n\r\nTo install simply drop the textures folder into your skyrim/data folder.\r\n\r\nCredits go to Bethesda for the original textures.
