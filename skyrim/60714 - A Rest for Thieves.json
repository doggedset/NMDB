  "summary": "A small house for new members of the Thieves Guild.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center]This mod adds a new player home to RIften, right next to Honeyside. Infront of it is the Thief Cache, over the door is a stronbox that contains the key. Inside there is some loot, and a small amount of storage (2 Chests, A Wardrobe, A barrel, a Large Sack, a Knapsack, and an End Table). To the left of the door (when you first walk in) you will find Thieves Guild Armor and a chicken  named Dudley. And before anyone asks.. yes.. I did name it after Dudley from the Sweet Life heh.. it doesn't have any special loot but it respawns so there really isn't any harm in killing it. This mod also adds a follower to the game named Hrogar Wolf-Blood who can be found in the Ragged Flaggon. AI Data &amp; Packages are all copied from Dirge and I'm having conflicts with AFT that are effecting followers in general in my game so I'm not sure if it will work for you or not. I don't really have any intention on bug-fixes or updates for this mod as it was meant for a very simple purpose which it is capable of serving. I may however change the Blade of Woe out for another weapon (or rename it and change it's attributes). Regardless of it's simplicity, I hope you enjoy it. \n<br />\n<br />I got the idea from the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28959/?]Riften Assassin Hideout[/url] by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2823671/?]Preykousis[/url].[/center]",
