  "descriptionHtml": "Riverwood Travelers v1.04\r\n\r\nFind 14 new followers in Sleeping Giant Inn of Riverwood.\r\nOptional:\r\nAlso I\\'ve added a new building to \\\"house\\\" them all.\r\nFollowers Hall is just East of Whiterun along the road to the north.  It has all amenities for the followers and you.  A master bedroom, eating hall, kitchen, crafting, shrines, training, stables, storage and bunks.  The house was made by my wife, and you may know her attention to detail.  All storage containers are safe.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nOnly activate one ESP file at a time.\r\nIf you decide to use FOLLOWER - Riverwood Travelers - Followers Hall.esp you may have to strip and fire your current follower.  Their Base ID is the same but their reference is different.\r\n\r\nThe Followers:\r\nAces the Assassin\r\nAnnika the Ranger\r\nBal-rok the Beast\r\nBritney the Battlemage\r\nConnie the Conjurer\r\nEric the Warrior\r\nKatianna the Spellsword (necromancer)\r\nKhajz the Ranger\r\nRolgeir the Barbarian\r\nRose the Rouge\r\nTammy the Valkyrie\r\nVal-rek the Vulture\r\nVanessa the Vigilant\r\nVictor the Soldier\r\n\r\nThey will level with you up to 80 and heal themselves (most of the time)\r\nThey have Lightfoot and many many other perks in relation to their class.\r\nThey have gear and weapons already, which is fully removable.\r\nThey are Essential and should not effect your sneak meter.\r\nThey also should not attack until you do or they get hit first.\r\nTheir names are their general play style and are ready to go as soon as you meet them.\r\nThey should not experience \\\"Grey Face\\\" bug.\r\n\r\nFollowers Hall is only slightly WIP as far as minor tweaks to bring life to it, nothing game breaking.\r\nThings I need some help with:\r\n1. Weapon racks.  Those darn weapons will not \\\"stick\\\" to the racks. I\\'ve copied the settings from other racks but they still just hover there.\r\n2. Instrument Idle markers.  The followers will use them but there is no sound of them playing.\r\n3. Training dummies animation.  I\\'ve copied some settings from other NPC interacting with the dummies, but the Followers will not use any of them.\r\n4. Proper Follower schedules.  Just so they will train, eat, go outside.  I got them to sleep though.\r\n\r\nDepending on your mods they will not look exactly like this, but none of them are \\\"ugly\\\" IMO.\r\n\r\nI use:\r\nBODY - UNP Body v1.51 (by dimon99) http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709\r\nBODY - UNP Face & Body HQ v1.9 (by navetsea) http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6554\r\nFACE -  Ethereal Elven Overhaul v1.0.5 (by nuska) http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24273\r\n",
