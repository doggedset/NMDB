  "summary": "Long distance goal: to create a romance quest with the charming and much underestimated lovely Angi, starting with making her better looking (imho) and marriable.\r\n\r\nUpdate 0.51: Thanks to all the help from the Community I managed to make her Follower by assigning the FemaleNord voice to the DialogueFollower script.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0F5MrLhgZkQ/T_IqCl8DkTI/AAAAAAAADVQ/bBdbh8QUn4c/s935/Angi+Cover4a.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nFrom the first time my Dovahkiin met Angi, this woman living alone in a small hut souteast to Falkreath, I thought that there was soo much potential in this character. So an idea was born to develop a slow romance between this lonely beauty and the Dovahkiin -visit by visit, but since I have at the moment as good as no experience with the creation kit and modding in general, it could take some time, so please be patient. I humbly started by changing her looks and making her essential and a potential spouse.\r\nAs I said this is my first step into modding, so please have mercy on me...;)\r\n\r\nUpdate 0.51: Thanks to all the help from the Community I managed to make her Follower by assigning the FemaleNord voice to the DialogueFollower script. There are still some issues about her voice (she remains silent if you ask her to follow you) but I hope I can fix them in the future. Thanks again to all of you for the help!\r\n\r\n\r\nRequired Mods:\r\nApachiiSkyhair http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\r\n\r\nRecommended (cosmetic) Mods:\r\nBetter Females by Bella  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812\r\nThe Eyes of Beauty http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722\r\nApachiiSkyHair and Beard Retexture (Nord) http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10357\r\n\r\nP.S.: \\\"Reflections For The Winter Of My Soul\\\" is a great story by Karl Edward Wagner featering Kane, Wagner\\'s Fantasy version of the biblical first murderer. I just chose the title becuause I think it suits Angi\\'s melancholic nature and personality\r\n\r\n                                                                   [img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/19650-1-1341160384.jpg[/img]",
