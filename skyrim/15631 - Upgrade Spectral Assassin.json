  "summary": "Upgrades and replaces the current Dark Brotherhood conjure ability Summon Spectral Assassin.\r\n \r\nFor all the assassins who were underwhelmed by the Summon Spectral Assassin ability, this mod is for you.",
  "descriptionHtml": "===================================================\r\n8/3/12 Revision Note:\r\n\r\nVersion 1d and 2d- Fixes unreported issue of Lucien only favoring his dart attacks and would never go into melee combat.  Lucien now balances the use of ranged and melee attacks.  This version also adds a two new techniques for Lucien to be more worthy of his \\\"Legendary\\\" status.  Please be forewarned that this latest revision is intended to be OP to match the strength of my other OP legendary summons; Potema, Ysgramor, Mankar, and Gray Fox.  Please see below for added abilities.  If you prefer a more balanced version, please don\\'t download this revision and keep version 1c or 2c in your data folder.  Version 1d has a 24 hour recast timer, version 2d doesn\\'t.\r\n===================================================\r\n6/16/12 Revision Note:\r\n\r\nVersion 1c - Fixes the issue with Lucien appearing without his hood.  Seems that Skyrim update 1.6 causes issues with named custom armor pieces.  Also fixes the issue with Lucien only using his poison and paralyze darts.  Also fixes the issue with Lucien not going into melee combat when close to his opponents.\r\n\r\nVersion 2c - Same as above, but this version does not have the 24 hour recast timer.\r\n\r\n=================================================\r\n5/9/12 Revision Note:\r\n\r\nVersion 1a - Retains the vanilla 24 hour recast timer to summon, and fixes the overpowered exploding darts of the fist version.  Now also equipped with the additional darts listed in the revised description below.  ALSO! He talks less now.  He\\'ll still say his random dialogue once in a while, but will do it less frequently to none and only makes grunts and comments when in battle like other followers. (I\\'ve lessen the amount of times he makes these noises too).\r\n\r\nVersion 2b - Removes his unnecessary need to talk so much! See 5/7 revision notes for additional changes.\r\n=================================================\r\n5/7/12 Revision Note:\r\n\r\nVersion 2a now available.  Version 2a fixes the OP explosive darts of the first two versions.  This version also removes the paralysis bomb and replaces it with a paralysis dart.  Version 2a also has two new abilities, poision darts and blinding darts.  Will update descriptions below.  This version has the no 24 hour casting limit.  I\\'ll make one with a 24 hour casting limit if I get enough requests for it.\r\n\r\n=================================================\r\n4/29/12 Revision Note:\r\n\r\nVersion 2 now available.  V2 removes the limitation of being able to summon Lucien only once per day.  The player can now summon him multiple times per day.  Keeping V1 available for those who still want to have the 1 day summoning limit.\r\n\r\n=================================================\r\n \r\nFirst, Lucian has been given his proper name instead of being called a spectral assassin.\r\n \r\nNext, I\\'ve provided Lucien with much needed abilities worthy of a legendary assassin.\r\n \r\n1. Equipped with the Blade of the Void: 50 Dmg with the chance of paralyzing an opponent until the next strike.\r\n2. Explosive Throwing Darts: Replaces Lucian\\'s weak bow with explosive darts.\r\n3: Paralysis Throwing Darts: Lucian tosses darts enlaced with poison that paralyzes his target for 3 seconds.\r\n4: Poison Throwing Darts: Lucian tosses poisoned darts that damage the opponent at 2 health per second for 1000 seconds.  Darts also enduce a temporary fear effect that lasts for 5 seconds.\r\n5: Blinding Throwing Darts: Lucian tosses an explosive dart that explodes in a bright flash.  Blinding flash blinds the opponent causing the target to attack wildly.\r\n6: Increased Speed: Lucian moves slightly faster than the average actor. (Not to the point he\\'s overpowered).\r\n7: Actor does not affect the stealth meter.\r\n8: Customized Combat Style that initially attacks with projectiles and then rushes for the kill.\r\n9: Upon getting the ability, Lucian is level 50 and levels up to 81 along with the player.\r\n10: Improved stats in health, magicka, and stamina.\r\n(UPDATED ABILITIES AVAILABLE ONLY ON VERSION 1d and 2d) -\r\n11: Assassin\\'s Counter: Lucien will violently counter any melee attacks aimed at him from the front.  This ability will disarm all foes within range in front of him.  \r\n12: Wrath of Sithis Enchantment: This enchantment replaces the old paralyzing property of the Blade of the Void and provides Lucien the ability to unleash a devastating and bloody combination attack that will literally destroy his opponents.  Lucien will \\\"operate\\\" on his victims and pull random bones from the victims body, and on a critical chance, will remove the victim\\'s heart instantly killing them.  This is very very gruesome when Lucien unleashes a kill move.\r\n \r\nThe spell is obtainable by regular means via finishing the Dark Brotherhood quest Bound Until Death. Lucian is not essential and so he will still disappear once taking too much damage. Other than the added abilities above, he remains similar to his vanilla incarnation.\r\n \r\nThis is my first submitted mod, but I have been working on more summons, spells, and an army of followers. Please let me know if there are any issues with this mod. I don\\'t believe it should have any issues with any mods unless there is another mod that changed the actor data for the Spectral Assassin summon.\r\n\r\n",
