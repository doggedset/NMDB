  "descriptionHtml": "**************************************************\r\n*    Sniper Bow Perks by Puff The Magic Dragon   *\r\n**************************************************\r\n\r\n===========\r\nDescription:\r\n===========\r\nThis mod adds 2 new perk ranks to the \\\"Deadly Aim\\\" perk which do 6x and 12x damage and require skill level 60 and 80 in sneak respectively.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0a has the same skill requirements, but is slightly more balanced, reducing the damage multiplier to 5x and 8x respectively.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0b simply rebalances the multipliers again to 6x and 9x.\r\n\r\nPick the damage multipliers you like best :)\r\n\r\n\r\n================\r\nSpecial Features\r\n================\r\nThese two new perk ranks modify the sneak attack multiplier for bows. I wanted to be an uber sniper and pick off lowly foresworn from a \r\n\r\ndistance with my precise headshots and I was sorely disappointed that a sneak attack dagger could do 15x damage while a bow only got 3x. Yes, \r\n\r\nI know the archery perk tree has some bonuses, but nothing substantial compared to the 15x sneak attack bonus, stacked with all the 1 handed \r\n\r\nbonuses. This can make sniping worthwhile in Skyrim :)\r\n\r\n\r\n============\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\nRecommended NMM:\r\nClick and run!\r\n\r\nManual:\r\nExtract the file directly into your <game folder>\\\\Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n=============\r\nCompatibility\r\n=============\r\nThis mod adds 2 new perks which won\\'t affect anything. However the original Deadly Aim perk is modified to point to the new perks, and any \r\n\r\nmod that changes the Deadly Aim perk will likely conflict with this mod.\r\n\r\n\r\n=====\r\nNotes\r\n=====\r\nMy first published mod for Skyrim!\r\n\r\n\r\n===============\r\nVersion History\r\n===============\r\nVersion 1.0 - Version 1, adds 2 new perk ranks to Deadly Aim, 6x60 & 12x80. \r\nVersion 1.0a - More balanced Version 1, sets multipliers to 5x and 8x.\r\n- I uploaded a small bugfix in 1.0a, it was still saying you got \\\"twelve times\\\" damage in the perk description. Now it reads correctly. If anyone downloaded 1.0a and has that bug, just redownload the file again.\r\nVersion 1.0b - Rebalanced at 6x and 9x.\r\n===============\r\nCredits goes to:\r\n===============\r\nAll the users on the TES forums who helped me figure out some of this junk, the CS Wiki for all the tutorials and reference, the users who \r\n\r\nupdate and contribute to the wiki, for Blender and all the users who\\'ve written wonderful tutorials for it, and for NifTools and the NifTools \r\n\r\nteam and all the hard work they put into making such wonderful tools available. I know I didn\\'t use half these tools for this mod, but they \r\n\r\nstill get credit cause they\\'re awesome.\r\n\r\nAnd many thanks to Bethesda for making such an awesome game and for making the construction set that lets people like me with way too much \r\n\r\nfree time modify the game.\r\n\r\nThanks to God for creating us all!",
