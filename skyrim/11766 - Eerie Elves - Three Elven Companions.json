  "descriptionHtml": " ~ Eerie Elves ~ \r\n\r\nAdds 3 companions: \r\n\r\nArtemis (the Wild)\r\n - Wood Elf\r\n - Ranger\r\n\r\nHel (the Shadow)\r\n - Dark Elf\r\n - Assassin\r\n\r\nSiren (the Demoniac)\r\n - High Elf\r\n - Mage\r\n\r\nYou can find them in Whiterun (I believe it\\'s called the Cloud District). \r\n\r\nI\\'ve briefly tested them, and the mod seems to be working. They should hopefully work just like any other normal follower. Siren may be a bit overpowered, she has a vampire Drain spell, just a heads up. \r\n\r\nThis was an attempt at a simple first mod for me, and I decided to share it. Hope you find it useful/enjoyable! It was made with \\\"Better Females by Bella\\\" in mind, and will go well with \\\"Killer Keos Skimpy CBBE V2 Armor Set\\\", for example.  To have several companions simultaneously, use Multiple Followers (http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1345602-wiprel-multiple-followers)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to Blackie for his tutorial. ",
