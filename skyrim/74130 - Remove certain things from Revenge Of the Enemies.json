  "summary": "If you use revenge of the enemies and like it, but think there are a few things you could be without, then this might be for you.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I use revenge of the enemies and am now dependent on it, but still I need near perfection to my taste in my game. What started me on revenge of the enemies was the Headless Knights which I though was just not in place in the game at all, so I decided to make an esp to remove them from the game. I figured I would share it, and perhaps expand into a library if I would continue to make edits to revenge of the enemies. Therefor the file name for the mod page is &#34;Remove certain things from Revenge Of the Enemies&#34;, since I might come to expand with more files. The files are very simple esp extensions that just make some very minor changes to the main mod, either by removing things or swapping things around.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to MyEvergreenHometown for making revenge of the enemies.",
