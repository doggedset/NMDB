All others are fine. Groovtama has a compatibility patch in the works. Download it [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38129]here[/url] as part of his [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38129]Word Wall Learning More Glorious[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33740]Sound Propagation Overhaul[/url][/color] is incompatible with DSAMG&#39;s music. It introduces pitch and speed variation, throwing off the timing/sync of the sequence.\r<br />A compatibility patch is available under the [color=crimson]miscellaneous[/color] section.\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i649.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Jonojediknight/Updates.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />Contrary to what is portrayed in Skyrim trailers and demos, in game dragon killing is pretty anti-climactic due to an unsatisfying, unemotional dragon soul absorb process. This mod&#39;s goal is to infuse some glory into dragon soul absorbing through [color=cadetblue]simple sound[/color] and [color=cadetblue]script[/color] edits. \r<br />\r<br />There are [color=cadetblue]eleven[/color] versions of glorious [b]MUSIC[/b] to choose from, all heavily modified snippets from the original soundtrack. Choose [color=cadetblue]one[/color] to install. \r<br />\r<br />The [color=violet]E3 demo version[/color] is unique in that it features a male dovahkiin victory cry. If you like one of the other musical versions (versions 2 - 5) but also want the victory cry, you can download a [b]VICTORY CRY[/b] add-on in the optionals section. For now there is only [color=cadetblue]one[/color] option, which is male. You can also just install the victory cry by itself, without any music.\r<br />\r<br />There are also [color=cadetblue]six[/color] [b]SCRIPTS[/b] to choose from. Number six (sound sources only) is very simple and changes the sound source to prevent distortion of the music as you move about. Install this if you just want music, no animation. The other five make the player perform an animation while absorbing the dragon soul. These include i) Master destruction spell (ritual spell), ii) Greybeard meditation, iii) Ritual skull animation, iv) Ascension animation, and v) Ascension version 2. Choose [color=cadetblue]one[/color] to install. As noted above, if you own Dragonborn, you should download compatibility versions [color=crimson][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35762/]here[/url][/color] instead of the ones in the updates section.\r<br />\r<br />There are also [color=cadetblue]two[/color] [b]PATCHES[/b] at the moment. One makes the music/victory cry more compatible with/won&#39;t play during the Greybeards&#39; Way of the Voice Quest. It includes a sound fx, a script, and an .esp which you must enable. The other patch makes the music in DSAMG compatible with the popular Sound Propagation Overhaul mod, version beta 0.95.\r<br />\r<br />Disclaimer: any script has the potential to cause unwanted glitches, crashes, and/or bugs. Please report them in the comments section.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks very much and happy dragon killing&#33;\r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i649.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Jonojediknight/Updates2.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />[IMG]http://i649.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Jonojediknight/mjoll.png[/IMG]\r<br />[color=cadetblue]May 24th[/color] - Uploaded E3 demo female victory cry, with words version.\r<br />\r<br />[color=cadetblue]May 24th[/color] - Uploaded E3 demo female victory cry, wordless version.\r<br />\r<br />[color=cadetblue]May 7th[/color] - Moved dragonborn patches to a new file to keep things less cluttered.

KEVKAS&#39; EDITS OF ORCHESTRAL VERSION 1[/color]\r<br />\r<br />- Custom version by community member kevkas that is basically the same as orchestral version 1, but there are gentler transitions between segments.\r<br />- The [u]victory melody[/u] is also delayed a bit and the [u]female vocals[/u] are quieter.\r<br />- Like orchestral version 1, this will affect the Greybeard Quest, but will not change word wall sounds (see patch).\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]5G0hOxwYskc[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[color=PeachPuff]3b. ORCHESTRAL V1 NO OUT-TRO[/color]\r<br />\r<br />- By request, this version is the same as [color=lime]Orchestral V1[/color] without the [u]female vocals[/u] and [u]victory melody[/u] out-tro\r<br />- The wind sound is edited to include the [u]Skyrim theme[/u]. \r<br />- This is followed by the normal barbarian choir/word of power sounds.\r<br />- This will affect the Greybeard Quest, but will not change word wall sounds (see patch).\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange]4.

CHANTING[/color]\r<br />\r<br />- The wind sound is edited to include [u]rhythmic chanting[/u] that you would hear faintly as you approach a word wall. \r<br />- This is a very subtle change, as it was my very first version and I wanted to start conservatively. \r<br />- Personally, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it given the newer, more ambitious versions available.\r<br />- This will affect the Greybeard Quest, but will not change word wall sounds (see patch).\r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i649.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Jonojediknight/Scripts.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Jonojediknight/aela2.png[/IMG]\r<br />These are optional. Any mod that alters [color=cadetblue]MQKillDragonScript[/color] is incompatible. Choose [u]one[/u] to install.\r<br />\r<br />I. RITUAL SPELL ANIMATION SCRIPT\r<br />\r<br />-  [color=cadetblue]MQKillDragonScript[/color] is edited to have the player automatically perform the master destruction spell (ritual spell) animation.\r<br />- The player will not have control during the animation, but will be invulnerable to damage.\r<br />- Made specifically for [color=violet]E3 demo version[/color], but compatible with [u]all versions[/u]. See demo video under [color=violet]E3 demo version[/color] description.\r<br />- [color=cadetblue]Version 1.2[/color] - animation ends with player returning to default stance rather than casting a spell down at the ground. Wind and explosion sound sources changed back to the dragon to fix volume issues.\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i649.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Jonojediknight/Ritualanimation.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />II. GREYBEARD MEDITATION ANIMATION SCRIPT\r<br />\r<br />-  [color=cadetblue]MQKillDragonScript[/color] is edited to have the player automatically perform the Greybeard meditation idle animation. \r<br />- Upper limb position will randomly alternate between hands on hips, palms up, or hands folded in front (see screenshots).\r<br />- The player will not have control during the animation, but will be invulnerable to damage.\r<br />- Made specifically for [color=aqua]trailer version[/color], but compatible with [u]all versions[/u]. See demo video under [color=aqua]trailer version[/color] description.\r<br />- [color=cadetblue]Version 1.2[/color] - meditation is followed by the bracing animation (braced pain). Wind and explosion sound sources changed back to the dragon to fix volume issues.\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i649.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Jonojediknight/Greybeardmeditateanimation.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />III. RITUAL SKULL ANIMATION SCRIPT\r<br />\r<br />-  [color=cadetblue]MQKillDragonScript[/color] is edited to have the player automatically perform the ritual skull idle animation (see image below for sequence).\r<br />- The player will not have control during the animation, but will be invulnerable to damage.\r<br />- The wind sound and explosion sound source are changed from the dragon to the player so that turning or moving will not distort the sounds.\r<br />- Made specifically for [color=aqua]trailer version[/color], but compatible with [u]all versions[/u]. \r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i649.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Jonojediknight/ritualskull.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />IV. ASCENSION ANIMATION SCRIPT\r<br />\r<br />-  [color=cadetblue]MQKillDragonScript[/color] is edited to have the player automatically perform the ascension animation (T02ascendfemale).\r<br />- The player will not have control during the animation, but will be invulnerable to damage.\r<br />- The wind sound and explosion sound source are changed from the dragon to the player so that turning or moving will not distort the sounds.\r<br />- Compatible with [u]all versions[/u]. See demo video under [color=lime]orchestral version 1[/color] description.\r<br />\r<br />V. ASCENSION VERSION 2 SCRIPT\r<br />\r<br />-  [color=cadetblue]MQKillDragonScript[/color] is edited to have the player automatically perform the ascension animation (T02ascendfemale).\r<br />- The player then descends and kneels for several seconds (blessingkneel) before arising.\r<br />- The player will not have control during the animation, but will be invulnerable to damage.\r<br />- Wind and explosion sound sources changed back to the dragon to fix volume issues.\r<br />- Compatible with [u]all versions[/u].\r<br />- See demo video under [color=skyblue]E3 demo version no victory cry[/color] description.\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i649.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Jonojediknight/ascension.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />VI. SOUND SOURCES ONLY SCRIPT\r<br />\r<br />- [color=cadetblue]MQKillDragonScript[/color] is edited to have the player as the source of the wind sound and explosion sounds, and not the dragon, so that turning or moving away from the dragon does not distort the music. Does not add any animation.\r<br />- Compatible with [u]all versions[/u]. Use if you want music/victory cry without any animation.\r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i649.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Jonojediknight/victorycry.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />[IMG]http://i649.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Jonojediknight/cicero.png[/IMG]\r<br />The male dovahkiin victory cry is part of the [color=violet]E3 demo version[/color]. However, if you like the victory cry but not the E3 demo version you can download a stand-alone victory cry sound file, which may be combined with any one of the other choices of music that edit the wind sound. These include: [color=aqua]trailer[/color], [color=lime]orchestral version 1[/color], [color=yellow]kevkas&#39; edits[/color], [color=orange]orchestral version 2[/color], or [color=crimson]chanting versions[/color]. You can also have the victory cry without any music. The choice is yours&#33;\r<br />\r<br />A. MALE VICTORY CRY (BETHESDA)\r<br />\r<br />- The dragon heartbeat/explosion sound includes a recording of the male dovahkiin victory cry seen at the end of the [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt7IeycKJKQ]E3 demo video #3 with Todd Howard[/url]. \r<br />- Unfortunately Bethesda decided not to include the original sound file, so this is a recording that has been heavily edited to remove as much background noise as possible.\r<br />\r<br />B.  FEMALE VICTORY CRY (VOICE ACTED) - CANCELLED\r<br />\r<br />- Unfortunately the voice actress who I had been collaborating with was too busy for the project. Please pm me if you are interested in recording a female victory cry.\r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i649.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Jonojediknight/patchy.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />[IMG]http://i649.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Jonojediknight/uthgerd3.png[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />i. GREYBEARD QUEST - WAY OF THE VOICE\r<br />\r<br />- During the main quest the Greybeards impart their knowledge of the Thuum to you. These sequences use the same sounds as used in the dragon soul absorb process. Hence, they are altered by all of the musical versions in this mod. Some may not care too much, but personally I find that the music is not appropriate for the scene. \r<br />- I have put together a &#34;patch&#34; that fixes much of the Greybeard sequence. It includes the two original sound files [color=cadetblue]NPCDragonDeathSequenceWind[/color] and [color=cadetblue]NPCDragonDeathSequenceExplosion[/color] with slightly altered names and a revised script, [color=cadetblue]MQGreyBeardAbsorbScript[/color] that draws on these sounds instead. Naturally, every sound requires a Sound Descriptor and Sound Marker, so there is a an [u].esp[/u] file as well that must be activated in the [u]Launcher[/u].\r<br />\r<br />- This patch will totally fix the Greybeard sequence for [color=lime]orchestral V1[/color], [color=yellow]kevkas&#39; edits[/color], [color=orange]orchestral v2[/color], and [color=crimson]chanting[/color].\r<br />- It will fix the intro for [color=violet]E3 demo version +/- victory cry[/color] and [color=aqua]trailer version[/color] but you will still hear whatever sound replaces the word of power. That has not been fixed. However, imo the sounds that replace the word of power in the [color=violet]E3 demo version[/color] fit very well and may even be preferable to the original sounds. \r<br />- You will find the patch under the misc section.\r<br />\r<br />ii. SOUND PROPAGATION OVERHAUL\r<br />\r<br />- This awesome mod changes certain variables to enhance the realism of transmitted sounds all across Skyrim.\r<br />- Unfortunately, changes made to [color=cadetblue]NPCDragonDeathSequenceWind[/color] and [color=cadetblue]NPCDragonDeathSequenceExplosion[/color] alter the speed and pitch of those sounds, causing the music in this mod not to be in sync or to be out of tune.\r<br />- I have provided a replacement .esp for Sound Propagation Overhaul version 0.95 beta that changes certain values for these sounds back to normal. \r<br />\r<br />For all future versions of SPPO, this is what you need to do to make the compatibility patch.\r<br />\r<br /> [URL=http://smg.photobucket.com/user/Jonojediknight/media/Untitleddd.jpg.html][IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Jonojediknight/Untitleddd.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r<br />1.

In that case, either try downloading a bit later when the servers are less busy or install manually.\r<br />- Play testing - easiest way is to spawn a dragon using the console:\r<br />\r<br />Push ~ (tilde key), then type\r<br />player.placeatme EAFB4 1\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i649.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Jonojediknight/Uninstallation.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />- Manual - delete the sound files in [color=cadetblue]data/sound/fx/npc/dragon/deathsequence[/color] and the three files in [color=cadetblue]data/music/special that end in wordofpower_01, wordofpower_02, and wordofpower_03[/color]. Also delete the file in data/scripts entitled [color=cadetblue]MQKillDragonScript.pex[/color], if you installed that.\r<br />- NMM - click the uninstall button.\r<br />\r<br />Note - if you are encountering bugs, please provide the following information:\r<br />              * What the bug is, when it occurs, what seems to make it go away, etc.\r<br />              * What version of music you are using\r<br />              * What version of script you are using\r<br />              * Any other dragon-related mods you have installed\r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i649.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Jonojediknight/faq.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />[color=skyblue]My animation is not playing. I can&#39;t absorb souls at all. Help&#33;&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[i]Do you have the Dragonborn DLC installed? If so, you need to download the scripts from the DSAMG Dragonborn compatibility module. It is found in a separate file (see top of page). If that doesn&#39;t solve the problem, make sure that you have the Unofficial Skyrim Patch and Unofficial Dragonborn Patch installed. Dragonborn patch must be AFTER the Skyrim patch in your load order.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[color=skyblue]Am I a sitting duck during the animation? Will I get eaten by other dragons?[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[i]No&#33; During the animation the command ToggleGodMode (tgm) is turned on. It&#39;s the one you use to cheat, which makes you totally immune to damage and have infinite magicka and stamina. It is turned off immediately after the animation ceases. Therefore, you will not get killed during the animation. That said, if you are surrounded by enemies and suddenly TGM is toggled off, you will likely get spam killed after it&#39;s finished.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[color=skyblue]Is this mod compatible with Deadly Dragons?[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[i]Technically yes. Deadly Dragons does not edit the same script that DSAMG does, so it should be compatible. Music will be 100% compatible because it does not rely on scripts. Animations should be compatible also. The one caveat to that is Deadly Dragons tends to add encounters with multiple dragons. If you are fighting more than one dragon simultaneously, there may be asynchrony in the absorb process, meaning disruptions to the music, music not lining up with animations, and a delay in the message &#34;Dragon Soul Absorbed&#34; appearing. This is due to the sheer number of scripts running at the same time and also depends on your hardware capabilities.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[color=skyblue]Why is there a pause between the wind sound and the &#34;Dragon Soul Absorbed&#34;?[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[i]If you experience pauses or delays between the music and/or animation and things seemed not synchronized, likely you have too many scripts running that are overwhelming your system. The mod was designed so that transitions would be totally smooth, not even noticeable at all, but having too many scripts or other mods that are resource taxing will mean that my script, [color=cadetblue]MQKillDragonScript[/color], runs slower. Try uninstalling one or two resource intensive mods to see if that corrects the asynchrony.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[color=skyblue]Why does the music get louder/softer all of a sudden?[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[i]The sound files were put together with the assumption that music and sound effects would be played at the same volume. If you have your music and sound effects at different volumes, there may be a noticeable difference in volume between parts of the absorb music. It&#39;s a simple fix - merely open up the game options in the in-game menu and make those levels the same.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[color=skyblue]Why are the pitch and timing of the sounds off? They were perfect before...[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[i]Players with DSAMG music installed who use the mod Sound Propagation Overhaul can expect to have the music sound off. SPO changed several parameters, such as pitch variability, volume, and distortion in order to make sounds more realistic. I have uploaded a compatibility patch, which you can find in the miscellaneous section. Replace SPO&#39;s .esp with the one provided. This works for SPO version 0.95 beta. For future versions of the mod, I may/may not release a patch. It&#39;s really simple to patch yourself, as long as you have CK. There&#39;s a tutorial in one of the patch section.[/i]\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i649.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Jonojediknight/FuturePlans.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />[IMG]http://i649.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Jonojediknight/brelyna.png[/IMG]\r<br />- Making a female version of victory cry (cancelled, open recruitment).\r<br />- All-in-one installer (in progress).\r<br />- Absorb animation for vampire lords and werewolves (????).\r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i649.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Jonojediknight/Credits.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />[IMG]http://i649.photobucket.com/albums/v63/Jonojediknight/sven.png[/IMG]\r<br />- gloomfrost for the original idea.\r<br />- BsA Unpacker program.\r<br />- Audacity sound editing software.\r<br />- kevkas for contributing alternate version.\r<br />- Groovtama for help with scripting.\r<br />- Jeremy Soule and Bethesda, for making an amazing, enthralling game worthy of epic mods.\r<br />\r<br />Feel free to submit suggestions and requests in the comments section. \r<br />\r<br />The mod is intended for personal use only - please do not re-upload it to other sites or include it any of your own uploaded mods without explicit permission.
