  "modName": "Retaliation",
  "summary": "Just a quick mod to add retaliation to enemies, very simular to the flame cloak spell...\r<br />This mod adds Flaming, Frost, and Shock cloaks as enchantments for armors/robes.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Range is meant to be melee ranged, but spreads out quite well, and makes for a wonderful slow burn AOE... In the same locations are a Frost and Shock version as well.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy your skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />Check out the Video, it shows all you need to know on where to get it, and how to enchant your other items once you have it... No spell needed, just an enchantment, I tried to make fair and balanced for leveling.\r<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC4SsLMfmMU\r<br />\r<br />Does NOT hurt those who are not enemies. No idea why that lizard guy decided to jump into the fray, in a quest, he ends up dead anyway... LOL",
