  "descriptionHtml": "[b]AL&#39;S REVAKZOOR - [i]Requires Dawnguard and Dragonborn DLC[/i][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Are you one of those gamers who is constantly seeking a greater challenge from Skyrim? You&#39;ve dominated [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3829/]Deadly Dragons[/url] and obliterated [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21256/]Oblivion Gates[/url], and still hunger for more?\r<br />\r<br />This mod is for you.\r<br />\r<br />The ruins of an ancient Nordic dwelling known as Revakzoor lie on a cliff overlooking the Northshore Landing, behind Castle Karstaag, on the island of Solstheim. Six - you heard me, [i]six[/i] - Mythic Dragons haunt this remote location. Mythic dragons are a step up - a BIG step up - from Legendary Dragons (which were added by the [i]Dawnguard[/i] DLC).\r<br />\r<br />But, should you survive, there is great treasure waiting for you within Revakzoor. And the dragons themselves are richly laden with five times the amount of loot other dragons drop. Go forth, Dovahkiin, and prove yourself the greatest of all dragons - if you can.\r<br />\r<br />[b]FAQ[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[i][b]Q:[/b] Just what are Mythic Dragons?[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[b]A:[/b] There are a type of dragon upgraded from Legendary, created by myself for this mod. They are 1.3x the player&#39;s level, with a minimum level of 99, with a +2800 health offset. They have the same Drain Vitality and Fire/Frost Breath shouts as a Legendary dragon, as well as the Unrelenting Force shout all dragons possess. In addition, they have a perk that does extra damage, above and beyond the similar perk Legendary Dragons have. They possess 50% resistance vs. each type of elemental damage (fire, frost, and shock).\r<br />\r<br />Most importantly, there are [b]six[/b] of them.\r<br />\r<br />[i][b]Q:[/b] This mod is too hard&#33;[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[b]A:[/b] The title of the mod includes the words &#34;Unfairly Difficult&#34;. If you download this mod despite that ominous moniker, don&#39;t complain. ;)\r<br />\r<br />[i][b]Q:[/b] Have YOU beaten this without cheating?[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Haven&#39;t tried. I prefer to design difficult challenges than to undertake them. :dance:\r<br />\r<br />[i][b]Q:[/b] The game freezes when I go to loot a dead Mythic Dragon&#33;[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Nope, it just takes a few seconds for the game to generate 5 times the leveled Death loot other dragons have. Be patient, shouldn&#39;t take more than a few seconds.\r<br />\r<br />[i][b]Q:[/b] I beat this mod&#33; :woot: [/i]\r<br />\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Without cheating?\r<br />\r<br />[i][b]Q:[/b] Yup&#33;[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[b]A:[/b] In that case, congratulations&#33; Do post a comment sharing your victory&#33; Screenshots also welcome.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]OTHER MODS BY ME[/u]:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Al&#39;s Completionist Series:\r<br />    1.
