  "descriptionHtml": "This is a colored version for both male and female Iron Armor. Male is red, female is green. \r\nI modified the color of the chest to give it a \\\"raw\\\" appereance and added a \\\"nordic symbol\\\" on the back.\r\nIt also affects the NPGs that wear Iron Armor.\r\nThis is my first and non professional mod.\r\nIt\\'s not an HD texture. \r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nINSTALL:\r\nExtract the \\\"textures\\\" folder, into your Skirim\\\\Data folder. Merge if asked to.\r\n\r\nUNINSTALL:\r\nDelete the folder named \\\"Iron\\\" from the \\\"Skirim\\\\Data\\\\Textures\\\\Armor\\\" folder.\r\nor\r\nDelete the files named \\\"curiassplate.dds\\\" from the \\\"Skirim\\\\Data\\\\Textures\\\\Armor\\\\Iron\\\\f\\\" folder AND from the \\\"Skirim\\\\Data\\\\Textures\\\\Armor\\\\Iron\\\\m\\\" folder.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nBethesda for the original texture.\r\nMyself for Photoshop modifications.\r\n",
