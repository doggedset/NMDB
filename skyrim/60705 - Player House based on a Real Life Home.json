  "descriptionHtml": "Title  says it all, this is a player house based on a real life home, my apartment basically.\r<br />\r<br />HOWEVER, this is not even near 100% what the real life one is.\r<br />(I would say it&#39;s 80% similar at least)\r<br />\r<br />This house is a little bigger and has less furnitures than the real thing (no eletronics for example, with the exception of a imitation of my TV lol).\r<br />\r<br />The toilets are awful too (I suck at housing mods, didn&#39;t think of a cool way of creating a bathroom).\r<br />\r<br />This is just a house based on my apartment, none of the levers do anything (I wanted to make them do stuff but couldn&#39;t progress with them).\r<br />\r<br />This player home is really just for you to stay and store your stuff, not one of these huge exploring homes.\r<br />\r<br />Oh and of course this mod is nothing compared to the good house mods.\r<br />This is just a crappy one hehe.\r<br />\r<br />If you need permission for anything just pm me.\r<br />\r<br />Requires:\r<br />\r<br />The Nexus Mod Manager.\r<br />The latest Skyrim version.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE 1.1 DETAILS:\r<br />- I changed the location of the house (see in the images if you need to).\r<br />\r<br />- If you saved your game inside the house or made it the home of any followers then I suggest you:\r<br />   -Leave the house and get your items.\r<br />   -Remove any relation any of your followers have with the house.\r<br />   -If you can&#39;t do any of the above your game will freeze in the loading screen if you get this update I think.\r<br />   -If you don&#39;t want to do any of the above then just don&#39;t download it, it&#39;s just location change after all :)\r<br />\r<br />- For some the reason the new version has 136kb instead of 56kbs even though all I did was change the location :(  Not sure what was my mistake.\r<br />\r<br />By the way if something appears asking about replacing a file with the same name just say yes.",
