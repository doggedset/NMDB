  "descriptionHtml": "Name: A Saints Tale - Rebirth\r\nVersion: 1.0\r\nDate: 2/4/2013\r\nCategory: Quests and Adventures\r\nAuthor(s): Scythe and Biulding3015\r\nSource: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7645\r\nForum: http://www.forums-dragoncaptions.com/a-saints-tale-rebirth-t741.html\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\n\\\"We Shall Rise again. From the ashes, we shall rise. Just like the Phoenix we shall rise again!\\\" \r\nThe Third and Final installment of the A Saints Tale project. The first two installments for for oblivion. Eagles Pass and Legend of San Kor. Those mod are not required to be able to play and enjoy this mod however.  The events in Oblivion happened two hundred years ago.  The story is being retold and concluded this time around.  The champion of Cyrodiil helped stem the tide of the Blood-Prophecy, however they were unable to stop the ultimate end.  Evil still lives on, even after the events in AST I & II.  \r\n\r\nAlthough it is weakened, Now is the chance to strike back against those who have lived in the shadows so long.  Reform the Order, and carry out the task the Champion of Cyrodiil could not complete.\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n========\r\nHead southwest from Falkreath. there is a road that leads south down through a mountain pass towards Cyrodiil. The village will be down there.\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\nIn Version one, the mod only includes the actual village of Eagles Pass.  There are not quests at this point in time.  however, more will be added later on.  The village has a handful of Npcs with their own unique schedules.  The quest line will make use of the Eagles Pass Village.   \r\n\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n1. Extract the files to a(install folder)\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\\r\n2. Start Skyrim Launcher, click \\'Data Files\\', place a checkmark beside the .esp file(s).\r\n\r\nUpgrade\r\n=======\r\nThis is the first version, so no need to upgrade. In the future however, just install the new esp over the old one, or simply install the new resource packs as they become available. \r\n\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nAnything that vastly changes the mountain pass south of Falkreath might cause a conflict.  This mod does its best not to edit any of the actual land or default objects in the area (this was not entirely possible.)  It does make an attempt to modify the navmesh so be advised if you use a conflicting mod. \r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nAI bugs where npcs will randomly disappear and reaper later on in the day.  I am assuming this has something to do with Navmesh issues.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n1.0 Village of Eagles Pass Added, Npcs have basic AI\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nBiulding3015 on nexus and Beths forums\r\nScythe on DC Forums\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nDragon Captions Team 2013\r\n\r\nTools Used\r\n==========\r\nReadme Generator - http://HammondsLegacy.com/obmm/tools_readme_generator1.asp\r\n\r\nLicensing/Legal\r\n===============\r\nYou can do whatever you want with this mod but all I ask in return is that \r\nyou give me credit if you distribute any part of this mod. I would also like\r\nto know what mods are including my work.",
