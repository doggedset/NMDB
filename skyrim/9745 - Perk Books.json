THERE ARE [u]NO[/u] EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE.[/size][/b][/center]\r\n\r\nThis plugin will add perk books to the general goods merchants at each of the five major cities in Skyrim.\r\n\r\nEach skill has an associated perk book for it. When you read a perk book for a particular skill, it will give you a perk available to you for that skill, then disappear after you close your inventory. If there aren't any perks available to you for that skill, e.g. your level is too low or you already have every perk for that skill, reading the book will have no effect. In the former case, you can try to read the book again once you have enough skill.\r\n\r\nNote that due to the way Skyrim handles multiple copies of the same item in your inventory, you shouldn't read multiple copies of the same skill book from your inventory at once. Doing so may cause every copy of that book in your inventory to be marked 'read' and you won't be able to get any perks from them. If you want to read many copies of the same book, place them on the ground or on a bookshelf first.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nPlace the contents of the archive in your Skyrim/Data directory. Works with Nexus Mod Manager.",
