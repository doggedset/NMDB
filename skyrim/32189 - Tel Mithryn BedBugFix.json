  "summary": "Neloth promised you a bed and chest, yet you get neither. Adds a player-owned bed, chest and more to a room in Tel Mithryn",
  "descriptionHtml": "Upon finishing the quest Old Friends, Neloth invites you to be a member of House Telvanni. If you ask him what that means exactly, he replies: \\\"\\\"For now, not much. But in a few decades when I return to Vardenfell, you would be seen as Morrowind nobility. In the mean time, [i]we would keep a bed and chest here for you.[/i]\\\"\r\nOnce you finish the quest, what looks like a storage room originally, will be transformed into your room. Grants access to a bed, chest, knapsack, satchel, bookcase and mannequin. (and a weapon plaque/rack but read known issues below)\r\n\r\n[u][size=5]Requirements:[/size][/u]\r\nDragonborn DLC\r\n\r\n[u][size=5]Changelog:[/size][/u]\r\n- v0.1 Initial Release\r\n\r\n[u][size=5]Known Issues[/size][/u]\r\n- If the script updates while you\\'re inside the tower the mannequin will be moving, simply exit/re-enter the tower and it\\'ll be fixed.\r\n- Equipment placed on weapon rack and plaque above certain value will be flagged as no longer your property and taking them will be considered stealing. (not sure yet how to fix)\r\n- If installing mod prior to finishing the quest, it will take up to 10 minutes before the room gets enabled after finishing the quest. Go outside, kill some stuff, return, voila!",
