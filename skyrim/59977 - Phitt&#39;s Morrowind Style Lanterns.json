When I tested them in game I found it annoying that you can bump into them and bounce back or get stuck - by paper lanterns&#33; So I decided to make these paper lanterns movable for more realism. \r<br />\r<br />To make them available for a broader spectrum of modders I separated these modified lanterns - movable and statics - for a standalone upload. \r<br />I added two static glass lanterns and some lantern-hangings as well. \r<br />\r<br />=========================\r<br />\r<br />Important: \r<br />\r<br />Add the lanterns in the folder &#34;Lanterns Movable Static&#34; as Movable Statics in the CK.\r<br />The lanterns in the folder &#34;Lanterns Static&#34; should be added as Statics. \r<br />\r<br />Known issues with the movable lanterns: The ragdoll physics on these is a little devil. They may not always behave like expected in the game. If you experience weird behavior, try to move them a little bit on their hanging, or try a different lantern model or a different hanging. Don&#39;t place them too close to a wall or another object. If nothing else helps to make them behave properly, use the statics instead. \r<br />\r<br />=========================\r<br />\r<br />Have a look at my friend Antiscamp&#39;s WIP mod &#34;Azura&#39;s Watch&#34; where he used many of these models already and made excellent use of them:\r<br />\r<br />http://frontierskyrim.wordpress.com/\r<br />http://frontierskyrim.wordpress.com/2014/10/14/the-third-tribe/\r<br />\r<br />=========================\r<br />Tools Used:\r<br />=========================\r<br />\r<br />Nifskope\r<br />NifUtils by Skyfox\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Permissions:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />This is a modders resource.You may use the files for your own mods as long as you give credit to the authors and you do not charge money for it.\r<br />Please link back to this resource when you use it in your mod.\r<br />\r<br />You may use this resource in Skyrim Special Edition too.
