  "summary": "!No longer works as of the patch that added horse combat, I\\'ll keep it uploaded in case its usable again sometime in the future, but that probably wont happen!",
  "descriptionHtml": "!Currently Broken, but I\\'ll keep it available in case someone can use the camera values for something else.!\r\n\r\nOnce again i was bothered by the vanilla camera angles, so much so that I avoided horses altogether. Part of the issue, was that the vanilla camera\\'s focal point seemed to be the horses rear, which made it feel unnatural to look at your surroundings, always had to look at stuff with the corners or sides of the screen. Also, maybe its just me, but with my camera angle, the horse looks less mis-proportioned, the horses of skyrim are a bit on the stumpy side.\r\n\r\nThe file is a text file, just follow the instructions included.\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re dissatisfied with the third person combat camera as well, then check out my CAMBAT camera, its not optimized for archers, but its simple to adjust it to your own liking.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8035",
