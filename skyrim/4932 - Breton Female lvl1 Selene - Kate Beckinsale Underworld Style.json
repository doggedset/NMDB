  "descriptionHtml": "I am actually a big fan of Kate Beckinsale, so I decided to recreate one of the characters played by her - Selene from Underworld.\r\nWas the attempt succesful? Judge for yourself. Too bad I am limited to only in-game editing tools, which lack flexibility and options selection. Hope CK will be released soon.\r\nThere was a mod already on Nexus with the same purpose (http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2976) by remymartin1986, but I find all this \\\"glamazon\\\" textures a little out of place. Check it out too, if you\\'re an admirer of Kate.\r\n\r\nP.S. Character DOES NOT have Nightingale Armor (or any other \\\"uncommon\\\") in her inventory, it was only used for taking screenshots.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n1) Just copy the file from archive to your Save folder (most commonly c:\\\\Users\\\\YourProfile\\\\Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Saves\\\\)\r\n2) Dowload and install one of the face texture mods listed below, especially marked as recommended. Otherwise this character may look very different from the results on screenshots.\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting:\r\nMaybe the game says something like \\\"content not avalible\\\" on loading the save - disregard that, I do not use any global mods that can ruin your game if you continue to play without them.\r\n\r\nFiles you might find useful (recommended for the best looks):\r\n\r\n1) [b][url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1329]Beauty Faces[/url][/b] by necKros - I currently use this face texture replacer, it is on screenshots. Recommended.\r\n2) [b][url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=124]Female Press Out The Wrinkles and Forehead v3[/url][/b] - by Windsong. [u]You will really need normal maps from this mod, or something similiar: Breton wrinkles spoil the whole idea of my little mod, so you need to replace them with more smooth normal map[/u]! Recommended.\r\n3) [b][url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3589]Natural Eyes Mod[/url][/b] - awesome mod by nevenbridge81.\r\n4) [b][url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2356]XCE Mod[/url][/b] - great work by Xenius\r\n5) [b][url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812]Better Females by Bella[/url][/b] - by BellaGail. Will do too, have tested. But IMO result is somewhat worse than Beauty Faces. At least note, that character will require some additional CC tweaks, if you prefer Bella\\'s textures.\r\nFeel free to experiment with different face textures and normal maps (especially normal maps, for more smooth or more natural skin look), there are so many of them here on Nexus.",
