  "summary": "Adds potions from the witcher series in skyrim. Has several custom effects plus a toxicity system. Also has a custom crafting system.",
  "descriptionHtml": "You like the witcher? Like skyrim? Wish skyrim was more like the witcher? Well this is the place for you. It adds almost all the potions from witcher 3 into skyrim. Mirrored the effects as closely as possible.\n<br />\n<br />What this mod does in depth:\n<br />Adds all witcher 3 potions except a few, a few with custom effects. It also has a toxicity system.  \n<br />The toxicity system is very easy to understand, each potion you drink adds 25 toxicity. Once you reach 100 it stops working. Once you drink one potion a countdown starts. Every 60 real life seconds, toxicity is reduced by 25. \n<br />\n<br />One thing to note about the toxicity system:\n<br />Due to skyrim's limitations, you can still drink potions after 100 toxicity, however no effects will apply. \n<br />Also the effects were altered some. Specifically Killer Whale, White Honey, and Golden Oriole.\n<br />\n<br />Killer Whale acts like the waterbreathing potion plus adds the same effect Cat does. Night vision. I added the Cat effect so you could see better underwater. Sadly its active at all times. Can't do anything about that.\n<br />\n<br />White Honey just resets toxicity. I tried adding it where it would remove potion effects too, but I couldn't get it to work. the dispel function seems to be broken.\n<br />\n<br />Golden Oriole, specifically Superior, due to skyrim's limitations, the poison health regen remains after poison ends. It SHOULD only work when you get poisoned. I didn't test all the different types of poisons.\n<br />\n<br />There are some potions that aren't here either because I couldn't get them working or because there's no way to have the same effect. \n<br />The ones that are NOT here are:\n<br />Blizzard\n<br />Blackblood\n<br />Drowner Pheremones\n<br />Maribor Forest\n<br />Petri's Philter\n<br />Wolven hour\n<br />Potion of clearance\n<br />Potion of restoration\n<br />\n<br />There's also a custom crafting system as well as a custom category. A note about the category, if you use SkyUI it doesn't work. Potions appear under food. I don't know how to fix that.\n<br />\n<br />How to get the potions:\n<br />You have to craft them. The recipes are in a leveled list. \n<br />10 is normal\n<br />25 is enhanced\n<br />50 is superior\n<br />\n<br />I added them to a lot of the leveled containers. Not all though.\n<br />\n<br />The crafting stations are located in every alchemy shop. Its identical to the vanilla alchemy lab, the correct one is labelled \"Witcher Alchemy Lab\"\n<br />Future Plans:\n<br />I plan on redoing the toxicity script eventually to be more like the witcher\n<br />I also plan on adding oils and maybe decoctions.\n<br />\n<br />Mods used in screenshots:\n<br />Customizable UI Replacer\n<br />SkyUI\n<br />Skykids\n<br />JRC's witcher swords\n<br />JRC's grandmaster ursine\n<br />\n<br />Requirements:\n<br />None. \n<br />\n<br />Compatability:\n<br />There can be a potential conflict if you have a mod that adds new crafting categories.\n<br />Also there could be a conflict if you have a mod that changes the interiors of the alchemy shops.\n<br />Other than those two, should be fine.\n<br />I don't know if this works in SE. If it doesn't, feel free to make a conversion. I don't play SE so I won't be making one.\n<br />\n<br />Permissions:\n<br />You're free to make a translation.\n<br />No uploading to any other site. Nexus only.\n<br />If you want to change some things and want to release them ask me first.\n<br />If you want to use the scripts for something ask me for permission. However, if you want to fix any mistakes in the scripts then go for it. But send me a copy of it.\n<br />\n<br />Credits:\n<br />Bethesda for creating the creation kit and skyrim\n<br />CD Projekt Red for creating the witcher games\n<br />Andrzej Sapkowski for being the genius behind the witcher books\n<br />Arron Dominion for his video guides on papyrus\n<br />IsharaMeradin for being so awesome in helping me with the toxicity script.\n<br />\n<br />A few final notes:\n<br />You can find the same recipe twice. I don't know how to change that. If someone knows please tell me.\n<br />\n<br />I did my best to root out the bugs, but I may have missed some.\n<br />\n<br />I deleted a few objects in the alchemy shops to make room for the crafting station. It shouldn't cause any problems though.\n<br />\n<br />If you wanna test the potions out before hunting them down or just wanna  cheat and get them without hunting open the console and type \"coc alchemytestingcell\" without quotes. There's a chest called \"Alchemy \n<br />testing chest\" \n<br />Has all the potions and recipes in there. No ingredients though.\n<br />\n<br />THIS IS IMPORTANT:\n<br />The effects can stack. Like Thunderbolt would stack with Enhanced Thunderbolt. This can lead to you being ridiculously OP. Same with Full Moon. So be careful unless you want to one hit everything. Thunderbolt is already pretty OP. There's no way to make it do a percentage of your weapon power that I know of. If there is a way someone please tell me.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />That about covers everything. If you enjoy the mod be sure to leave an endorsement. If you find any bugs be sure to report them.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Note about upgrading to 1.1:\n<br />Be sure to completely uninstall the mod before updating. I removed a script. Save will be fine. It was a very light weight script. Might be wise to do a clean save regardless. I always do one when updating mods.\n<br />If haven't downloaded and installed 1.0 then disregard this.",
