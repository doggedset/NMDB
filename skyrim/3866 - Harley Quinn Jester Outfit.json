  "summary": "Replaces the Female Jester Outfit for a lore friendly Harley Quinn (Joker\\'s Girlfriend) costume. This mod is intended to inspire more skilled modders to create a batman esque questline that fits the skyrim lore. \r\n\r\nBATMAN :D",
  "descriptionHtml": "My second mod ever.\r\n\r\nI replaced the female jester textures to a harley quinn suit. \r\n\r\nI should also note, this jester suit is 2X bigger then the original. So make sure you have the right memory to use bigger textures.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I had to retexture the male hat aswell because that is the version that is appearing on my female characters head.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nExtract texture folder into common/skyrim/data folder. When prompted, say yes to merging files.\r\n\r\nPermissions: You are free to use this mod without my permission if you intend to make either:\r\n\r\na) a batman quest mod\r\nb) a batman texture pack (that is lore friendly - as in, it\\'s as if batman storyline came organically out of skyrim).\r\nc) you want to make this outfit seperate from the jesters outfit (i have no idea how to do this).\r\n\r\nand you are not:\r\n\r\nEditing it, or compiling it with any mod which makes female or male outfits deliberately revealing. \r\n\r\nI am happy to even give editing access to this mod page etc. Just give me a little credit if you do use this texture :D\r\n\r\nI intended to make this texture mod under fair use, it is a fan production and Batman and its subsidiary properties are not owned by my but by their respective property owners. \r\n\r\nSee the full list of my mods: [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=697950] here[/url]",
