  "summary": "Just a mod which adds some fairly square armor to the game :D",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds some armor to the game which is fairly [B]cubic[/B]. (Have a look at the pics)\r\n\r\nThere is the CubeMan version of the armor which is just grey, but there is also an EnderMan Version which is black with pink/purple eyes.\r\n\r\nBoth armor stats are 80 and are both weightless. You can either make a perilous journey to the mysterious dragonsreach and seek Cubic, who holds the armors. Just let him follow you and the armor is yours.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nYou can use the console and get them that way.\r\nJust type - [B] help CubeMan [/B] and - [B] help EnderMan [/B]\r\n\r\nTo install:\r\n\r\nUnpack the \\\"CubeMan--EnderMan Armor\\\"\r\nPut the contents of the file in your Skyrim----Data Folder\r\nThen start Skyrim, make sure the mod \\\"CubeMan\\\" is checked and play!!\r\n\r\nQuite a short description but I think that is everything. If you have any questions or want me to help with something just ask away!!\r\n\r\nOne more thing. In case you didn\\'t realise this mod is NOT lore friendly.\r\n\r\n============================================================================================\r\n============================================================================================\r\n\r\nUPDATE: You can now play as StickMan (black armour) or PersonMan (red armour and by request)\r\n\r\nThe legs of the armour don\\'t bend but I tihnk I know how to fix this. But unfortunately due to exams I won\\'t be able to fix this or add more stuff until after next week. \r\n\r\nThere is also another armour called HoltzMan. This isn\\'t working as it should and is incomplete anyway, but I left it in for fun.\r\n\r\nAll the armours are found on the follower mentioned somewhere above. Installing is the same. If you are asked to replace the files just click yes to all and it should be fine.\r\n\r\nI think thats everything. ",
