  "descriptionHtml": "Update changes are at the bottom\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n============\r\nThis mod add a flea market with bunch of rich merchant NPCs in Skyrim. Flea market is not in the city but on free, mostly flat central part of Skyrim.\r\n\r\nA VERY SPECIAL THANKS TO THE -= samv96UK =-\r\n\r\n[youtube]ZfDB7Ih3lx4[/youtube][youtube]v2RDsiBOfoY[/youtube]\r\n\r\nWHY?\r\n=====\r\nEvery time I played game over and over, I ended up having problems to sell my stuff. No matter if I was dragging loads of items from dungeons, made loads of expensive alchemy ingredients, or did banish enchanting - all merchants had too few coins to buy my items even with all speech perks and investments made in stores. So, there are 2 solutions: increase money of present merchants or add new. I decided to add new merchants outside of cities in a flea market fashion so it doesn\\'t break immersion and doesn\\'t force player to use their services.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps you too. If it does, please endorse.\r\n\r\nHELP!\r\n=====\r\nThis is my second mod I ever made and I need help with few things. I need your help for:\r\n- I need help to add 2-3 bards in open space there at the market\r\n- make all (or most) NPCs talk like that Khajiit merchant\r\n- ideas for Forbiden Goods (please no Psyjic order items, only things that would be immersive as she is a thief)\r\n- general feedback\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\r\n==============\r\nIt should be only Skyrim.esm and Update.esp. I do have Dawnguard and Dragonborn but I think they are not needed. I believe only v1.8 of the game\r\nSince this is in the open world, it might be taxing on your PC but I doubt. I have many mods regarding better textures, lighting, Skyrim Flora Overhaul, weather... and it still work fine no FPS loss on highest settings. My PC is:\r\nPentium Dual core 2.9GHz\r\n3,37 GB RAM - my motherboard is stupid, I run Win7 x64 with 4GB RAM!\r\nnVidia 550Ti 1GB\r\nSo I assume most players will run this without problems but I really expect everybody can run this. \r\nNOTE: I do not use ENB! Enhanced Lights and FX + Realistic lighting overhaul only (and I highly recommend these mods)!\r\n [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27043 ]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27043[/url]\r\n [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30450] http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30450[/url]\r\n \r\nFor more how these mods look look at pics here:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/articles/856/] http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/articles/856/[/url]\r\n \r\nEXTRA INFO\r\n===========\r\nSince this mod do not require anything more than basic Skyrim and it\\'s update, only basic Skyrim goods can be found at these merchants. I really was tempting to add items from other mods (cloaks) but then, it could be requirement so I didn\\'t do that. Maybe will make separate version of mod.\r\n\r\nPLANS\r\n======\r\n- add optional files for users of Cloaks mod and /moderate priority/\r\n- add few quests /moderate priority/\r\n- replace peddlers with dedicated merchants /moderate priority/\r\n- reorder goods on stalls and add maybe more /moderate priority/\r\n- make bards sing - need help on this /moderate priority/\r\n- make merchants advertise goods (examples like Madesi in Riften says \\\"Fine jewelry here!\\\" or others say \\\"Fresh fish!\\\" and so on - any tips how to achieve this?) /moderate priority/\r\n- add carriage /low priority/\r\n- add some elements like rocks etc to fix lighting at night /low priority/\r\n- separate version with lights casting shadows /low priority/\r\n- fix mannequin (why it moves? only when player tries to \\\"talk\\\" with it it freezes - he is evil!) /low priority/\r\n\r\nCHANGE LOG\r\n============\r\n0.9\r\n- fixed bug with falling NPCs into ground - 2 words - MANUAL NAVMESH \r\n- removed partial wandering of some NPCs, or make it standard \r\n- fixed faces of blacksmith and cloth vendor - thanks to samv96UK the for advices\r\n- replaced flee with flea - sorry, not native english",
