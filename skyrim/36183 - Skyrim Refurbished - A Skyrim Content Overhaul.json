Updating \r\n10. compatibility\r\n11. changelog  \r\n============================================================================================\r\n1. \r\nSkyrim Refurbished is aimed at overhauling the games vanilla world. This includes adding 10-15 new fallout style random NPCs to all the main cities in Skyrim. \r\n============================================================================================\r\n2. NPCS: \r\nLike in Fallout, these NPCs are simply name \r\n\\\"(insertcitynamehere) Citizen\\\" they follow schedules that involve: browsing at the local market, wandering the city, and eating at the local inn. It also adds other NPCs like vigilants of stendarr that travel between cities and bands of adventures searching for treasure.   \r\n============================================================================================\r\n3. FLORA: \r\nSkyrim Refurbished also adds many plants to cities that have the space for them. These cities manly  \r\ninclude Whiterun and Solitude. I have done my best to not go crazy with the flora in order to conserve frame rates. \r\n============================================================================================\r\n4. OBJECTS: \r\nThis mod also adds many objects to the world as well. This includes barrels, crates, furniture, containers, blacksmiths, balistas and so and so on. I have done my best to tweak the navmesh to suit these features but don\\'t be surprised if you get any NPCs walking into crates or something. \r\n============================================================================================\r\n5. BATTLEFIELDS: \r\nThere are now random battles around Skyrim. In the current version there are not that many at all but you can expect some more soon.  \r\n============================================================================================\r\n6. IMPORTANT NOTE: \r\nThis mod is still very much in development. All the major cities now have added random NPCs and objects. However there are still man more updates to come. (see change log) \r\n============================================================================================\r\n7. INSTALLATION: \r\nTo install simply extract the downloaded folder into your Skyrim data folder. Easy. \r\n============================================================================================\r\n8. UNINSTALLING: \r\nTo Uninstall, uncheck \\\"Skyrim Refurbished\\\" in Skyrim Launcher/Data Files then delete from your data folder. Again, easy. \r\n============================================================================================\r\n9. UPDATING: \r\nHere is what I found the safest way to update.\r\n1. Save your game and exit.\r\n2. Uncheck \\\"Skyrim Refurbished\\\". \r\n3. Run your game again and hit continue (ignore warnings) then save and exit again.\r\n4. Delete old file and replace with old one.  \r\n============================================================================================\r\n10. COMPATIBILITY: \r\nAny mod that drastically changes cities is most likely in-compatible with Skyrim Refurbished. I have not tested with open cities or crowded cities but they are most likely incompatible as well. \r\n============================================================================================    \r\n11. CHANGELOG:\r\nVersion 2 20/05/13 \r\n- Added NPCs to Windhelm and Markarth \r\n- Fix a vigilant of stendaar not doing any thing \r\n- In Markarth, thugs roam the docks at night \r\n- Added battlefields outside Markarth and Whiterun \r\n- Fixed some idle markers \r\n- Added a blacksmith apprentice to Riften and Solitude \r\n- A familiar character from oblivion can now be found behind the Bannered Mere \r\n\r\nVersion 3 22/05/13\r\nThe list of things I added would be to long to put in here so here are the major changes. \r\n- Added more NPC presets for random generation \r\n- Fixed the random NPC\\'s voices\r\n- added many more barrels, crates, etc around the world \r\n- added a few more battlefields (mainly around solitude) \r\nDon\\'t forget to update properly and endorse!   \r\n============================================================================================\r\nCOMING SOON: \r\nAdding more warzones \r\nAdding more NPCs (adventures, thugs etc) \r\nImproving remote villages \r\nAdding new remote villages \r\nPossibly adding a new faction  \r\n============================================================================================\r\nIf you have ANY suggestions for the mod please share, also please report any bugs. Finally don\\'t forget to share and endorse as it encourages me to update!   \r\n\r\nHope you enjoy the mod.  \r\n============================================================================================\r\nPS: Anyone who is willing to help out with some scripting please message me.  \r\n    ",
