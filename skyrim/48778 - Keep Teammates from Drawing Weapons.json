  "descriptionHtml": "Extremely tiny mod that does nothing more than keep your teammates (followers) from drawing weapons when you do. They will still draw when they enter combat as normal.\r<br />\r<br />Added by request.\r<br />\r<br />This mod should be placed somewhere near the bottom of the load order, but it really doesn&#39;t matter, because it doesn&#39;t affect any records and only changes a single game setting.\r<br />\r<br />The game setting it changes, for those interested, is fAIDistanceTeammateDrawWeapon from the default of 2000 to 0. This is the same edit UFO, EFF, and Convenient Horses makes to keep followers from drawing when you do, so if it shows up as a conflict line when cleaning, that&#39;s why. That said, if you use UFO, EFF, or CH you do NOT need this file.\r<br />\r<br />",
