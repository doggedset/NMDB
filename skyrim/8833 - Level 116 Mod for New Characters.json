  "descriptionHtml": "This is only a simple batch file that uses the advskill command to boost all skills to 100.  You can use it to simply max all stats OR, at the start of a new game BEFORE you pick your race, run it.  Then run it again afterwards.  Once you get to the Helgen Keep you will be able to distribute stats and perk points, and your level will be 116!  This is a pretty major cheat and will take a lot of the fun out of the game possibly, I\\'m uploading it because it allows you to break the cap and I thought that was interesting :)\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n\r\nJust copy the text file to your main skyrim folder and run \\\"bat max\\\" in the console (without the \\\"\\\").",
