  "descriptionHtml": "To all the people using this mod. I am sorry that there has been no updating yet and I do not think there will be. I am still working on this mod however it just will not come under this mod. When I do finish it I will post a link to the new mod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have just working on this so this is a work in progress. In the end it will feature a couple hour long quest line, a massive player home, hopefully a realm of oblivion that you can rule and many changes to the vampire and werewolf races. \r\n\r\nversion 0.1.0 Beta\r\nYou can only start the game out as a Hybrid Nord by opening the race menu or starting a new game. I am going a head a posting this so people can tell me how overpowered it is or not. I will be really overpowered now because the mod is not done so you will not have to start fighting hybrid npc yet but you will soon, hopefully. ",
