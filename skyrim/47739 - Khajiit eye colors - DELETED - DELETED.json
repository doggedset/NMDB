  "descriptionHtml": "I didn't like the eye color choices for khajiits. most of them seemed to dull to me. I also didn't want super high definition eyes or anything, I just wanted something that would fit in with vanilla. So I made these with more color choices and brightness. They should mostly fit in except maybe pink and red.\r\n\r\nThis adds five new colors and their narrow versions. I added brown, forest green, lighter green, pink and red. I might add more colors if this ends up working correctly and if there are colors people are interested in.\r\n\r\n",
