  "descriptionHtml": "[youtube]AWDKGGDJkME[/youtube]\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n=========\r\nThis mod changes Lydia\\'s appearence by changing her hair and removing most of her makeup. The armor is a custom set made from Ancient Hero armor. It has the same stats as her default steel armor. The custom Ancient Hero set was chosen because it is Nord themed as well as unique to Whiterun as it can only be crafted at the Skyforge. To complete the set I have placed her helmet next to her dresser. It is the only piece that you can add/remove from her inventory. It also adds an Imperial Bow to her inventory.\r\n\r\nWhy I made this mod....\r\n===================\r\nI felt that Housecarls lacked character with their very basic gear and appearence. I think that this makeover adds to the character in a way that makes her more desireable as a companion without making her overpowered in anyway.\r\n\r\nI do intend to release another version of this mod as a seperate download that adds her set of armor with higher armor rating and removable from her inventory so it can be enchanted or improved with blacksmithing. It will also make her essential so she will not die. I am also considering adding a few perks to her as a \\'Combat Veteran\\' pack for those who want to use her all the way through the game. This will be done for all Housecarls. I will post a link to the mods here once released.\r\n\r\nThis mod is also on...\r\nSteam - [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=87087227]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=87087227[/url]\r\n\r\nAlso check out my most recent mod Breezehome Basement - Single Cell...\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21247]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21247[/url]\r\n\r\nIf any of the future projects interests you then check me out at...\r\n\r\nMy website - [url=http://www.demorus.com]www.demorus.com[/url]\r\nYouTube - [url=http://www.youtube.com/user/DemoTheKeySmasher]DemoTheKeySmasher[/url]\r\nTwitter - [url=http://www.twitter.com/DemoTKS]DemoTKS[/url]\r\n\r\nShow your support!
