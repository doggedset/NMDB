  "descriptionHtml": "I've been in [b]NexusMods[/b] for a while, and I think my journey here won't be complete without contributing something. \n<br />So here he is, my first custom follower ever! He's my early attempt in modding since Sims 3(which I'm bad at).\n<br />\n<br />He's been with me journeying through draugr-infested tomb, lost for days in dwarven ruins, and slaying those horrifying Frostbite Spiders. \n<br />So far he never disappoints me, well except that one time he killed Anska and failed my quest([url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/A_Scroll_For_Anska]Scroll For Anska[/url]) #CompletelyAccident\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]\n<br />[i][size=2]Before you download, I must tell you that he is a very basic follower. So no custom dialogue, no custom anything.[/size][/i][/b][size=2]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Install:[/b]\n<br />Let the NexusMod Manager do the do or drop both .esp and .bsa file to [ .../Skyrim/Data ]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Location:[/b] He can be found at Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood, drinking ales.\n<br />\n<br />[b]General:[/b]\n<br />I set him at minimum level of 5 to maximum 150, also I set him to level up 2x player's level.\n<br />His combat style is ForswornBerserkerLow. So  basically he will shoot arrows at distance and melee when enemy is too close.\n<br />He is marriage candidate, in case you wanna marry him.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Equipment: [/b]\n<br />Steel Armor (You can change it using UFO or straight up edit it in Creation Kit)\n<br />NordHero Greatsword\n<br />NordHero Bow+Arrow(200)\n<br />\n<br />[b]Spells:[/b]\n<br />Candlelight (I'm not too keen with torches)\n<br />Waterbreathing (not sure it's needed or not for custom follower)\n<br />HealingHands\n<br />GrandHealingLeftHand\n<br />IncinerateRightHand\n<br />FastHealingLeftHand (yep, I die a lot in Skyrim, so I made him a healer)\n<br />EbonyFleshLeftHand\n<br />NordBattleCry\n<br />\n<br />[b]Perks:[/b]\n<br />NOTHING (sorry!)\n<br />\n<br />Feel free to modify him to your heart's content, that's why he's a simple follower. Add spells! Give Weapons! Tons of gold! So you can rob him later! \n<br />Do whatever you want,  just be nice to him and if you include him in your mod, please credit.\n<br />\n<br />To make him looks like in screenshot, I use:\n<br />[i][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2488/?]Younger faces merged with Men by Geonox[/url] [/b][/i]\n<br />[i][b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26145/?]Smooth Male Body - textures for Better Males - SOS Schlongs of Skyrim by urshi [/url][/b][/i]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Noob Question: [/b]\n<br />I want to upload my improved version of him, but unfortunately he has the grey face bug. So I upload this basic version\n<br />If anyone know how to fix it, it will be greatly appreciated!\n<br />\n<br />                        \n<br />Thanks for reading!",
