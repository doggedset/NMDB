  "descriptionHtml": "This mod replaces the gold coins and coin purses to rupees from the Legend of Zelda series. This is also my first mod I&#39;ve completed so it&#39;s not perfect, but I think it&#39;s a good start. Feedback is always appreciated&#33;\r<br />\r<br />WHAT IT FEATURES:\r<br />Includes complete independency from the game. You will now be able to switch between the mod being on or off and the gold coins and coin purses will not be overwritten when the mod is off.\r<br />\r<br />Gold Coin replacement with a green rupee (worth 1).\r<br />Small Coin Purse mesh remains the same. The values, however, have been modified. When you pick it up, you will have a value between 10 and 50.\r<br />Medium Coin Purse mesh remains the same. The values, however, have been modified. When you pick it up, you will have a value between 50 and 200.\r<br />Large Coin Purse mesh remains the same. The values, however, have been modified. When you pick it up, you will have a value between 300 and 500.\r<br />\r<br />The pickup noise has also been replaced with the sound effect from the game, &#34;Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker&#34;, found here: http://noproblo.dayjo.org/ZeldaSounds/\r<br />\r<br />BUGS:\r<br />Up to my knowledge, there are no longer any bugs. However, there will be conflicts with mods that edit the currency in any way.\r<br />\r<br />On a seperate note, I was asked about having the rupees being a secondary currency similar to Fallout: New Vegas, however, I&#39;m unsure how to start adding it in game. I would hypothesize it is straightforward and copy the values, edit some CK values, etc., however, the problem I forsee is getting the currency accepted/used in-game by vendors. I will keep this idea in mind, however, I am not making any promises.",
