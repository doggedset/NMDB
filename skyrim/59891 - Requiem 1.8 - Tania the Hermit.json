  "descriptionHtml": "[size=2][size=3][size=4]This is a simple patch to make [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58670/?]Tania the Hermit[/url] (by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5742279/?]Kasprutz[/url]) follower mods to fit better with Requiem 1.8.1(.1).\r<br />\r<br />The changes I have made, both improve requiem&#39;s compatibility and requiem&#39;s lore.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[u][size=4]Changelog :\r<br />[/size][/u]\r<br />Version 1.2 :\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]Added few news records brought with 3.5 to my patch and updated some old records that were updated by the version 3.5 of the mod.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />The version 1.1 :\r<br />\r<br />[size=2][size=3][u]Changes on Tania : [/u][/size][/size]\r<br />[size=2]\r<br />I&#39;ve edited the Hermit race, to match other races in requiem, I think the hermit race was based on woodelf so I&#39;ve added most requiem&#39;s woodelf characteristics. But not all it has to be unique.\r<br />Most noticeably her carry weight goes from a base of 300 to 85.\r<br />I&#39;ve also edited the vampire version of Hermit Race, to fits requiem vampire race, as a vampire her carryweigh is now of 145 (instead of 300).\r<br />I&#39;ve also increased a little her base health/magicka/stamina since it suits better with her race new characteristics. But nothing overpowered, not at all&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />The version 1.0 contains :\r<br />\r<br />[u]Changes on Tania : [/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Her creator says : &#34;She is weak and fragile so, you need to take care of her in combat.&#34;[/size][size=2]\r<br />I took it into account and in my opinion, she needed to have some of her skills lowered to fit better with requiem&#39;s mechanics. But I did not lowered them too much though.\r<br />I&#39;ve also added her two requiem&#39;s required perks.\r<br />She no longer have infinite arrows, she has only 40 arrows and it will decrease accordingly to her fight and non recovered arrows.\r<br />[/size][size=2]\r<br />[u][size=3]Changes on her gear :[/size][/u]\r<br />\r<br />Dagger :\r<br />In order to requiemify h[/size][size=2]er dagger, I had to lower its base damage. It was even more deadly than Daedric/dragonbone daggers.\r<br />(but remenber, requiem add it&#39;s own multiplier damage so it&#39;s still increadly deadlier than vanilla.) Now it has the same base damage than Glass daggers.\r<br />Its critical damage was also lowered a little bit but on the other hand I have lowered the weight of the dagger.\r<br />But it is still a very powerful dagger&#33; And considering its very high base damage and it is a unique dagger, its price was considerably raised, its new value is now set to 825 septims. (275 default).\r<br /> \r<br />[/size][size=2]Bow : \r<br />The bow is now much more powerful, like requiem&#39;s bow, it&#39;s a light bow though I gave it similar stats than elven bow, but slightly less. It now has a base damage of 25 (default was 7 and elven bow is 26). Its weight felt just about right.\r<br /> However it has a main advantage over the standard elven bow, it is efficient against undeads since it is made of silver.\r<br />Just like other requiem&#39;s bow its animation speed was lowered by 2.5 times but it&#39;s still a fast bow among according to requiem.\r<br />Bow value was again considerably increase, it is now worth 940 septims (I think a princess uses expensive tools ? And many items in Requiem are much more expensive) because it is rare and powerful at the same time.\r<br />I&#39;ve also added a requiem keyword to the bow.\r<br />\r<br />Arrows:\r<br />Added missing requiem&#39;s keyword\r<br />They are now nearly 4 times more powerfull, nearly like the elven arrow, just slightly less since they are more effective agaisnt undead.\r<br />Their values was raised to 20 septim instead of 5.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][size=4]Load order : [/size][/u]\r<br />\r<br />...\r<br />...\r<br />Hermit.esp\r<br />...\r<br />...\r<br />...\r<br />Requiem.esp    &lt;------------------------------------- Requiem.esp should be quite low in your load order, do not trust LOOT or BOSS.\r<br />[/size]...                                                                    If you put something after requiem.esp it is because you know what you do.\r<br />Requiem 1.8 - Tania the Hermit 3.0.1.esp\r<br />...\r<br />\r<br />If you don&#39;t know what can go after and what has to be before requiem you can check my load order :\r<br />[url=http://pastebin.com/v2quGUKY]http://pastebin.com/v2quGUKY[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Thanks and Credits\r<br />Kasprutz, Magnificat and Aryes Grace for Tania the Hermit\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58670/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58670/[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Xarrian and Ogerboos for Requiem - The Roleplaying Overhaul\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281/?[/url][/size]",
