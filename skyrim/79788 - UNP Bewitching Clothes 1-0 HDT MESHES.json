Sorry for the inconvenience.\r<br />\r<br />Meshes to enable BBP for the UNP Bewitching Clothes. Contains BBP enabled clothes and hair meshes (Amber Lights only for now... if anyone wants something different I can take a whack at it but no promises) and adjustments to the boot and hat meshes to minimize clipping. This is my poor attempt to contribute something. It works fine on my set up, but not being an expert (or even remotely proficient) with this stuff I really have no idea whether it will work for anyone else. All I can say is try it and see. \r<br />\r<br />Just install it over the original mod by zzjay here... \r<br />\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79740/?",
