The installed version is, the new version is.\",\n<br />and it asks you \"Would you like to upgrade?\", also it says you \"Selecting NO it will the new Mod normally\", you should click NO and not YES, it will keep the main file and will replace the update files over the main file.\n<br />\n<br />Its not hard to do it so! oo[/color]\n<br />\n<br />Author: haldir307\n<br />Required DLC: Dawnguard\n<br />\n<br />Description:\n<br />I got inspired from the Draconic gear of Lineage 2, so i duplicated the\n<br />Dragonscale cuirass/gloves/boots, the Dragonplate Helmet\n<br />and Dragonbone Greatsword, also its standalone and craftable.\n<br />\n<br />Installation:\n<br />Extract \"Draconic_Armor_and_Weapon\" and copy the folder \"Data\" to Program FilesSteamSteamAppscommonskyrim\n<br />\n<br />Run SkyrimLauncher, click to Data Files and checkmark the empty box of the DraconicArmorAndWeapon.esp,\n<br />checkmark the empty box of Load Loose Files and click OK.\n<br />Attention please, if the Data Files section is grey and isn't working, go to this directory:\n<br />C:Users****DocumentsMy GamesSkyrim\n<br />and open SkyrimPrefs.ini, find the [Launcher] and type under of the last line,\n<br />those two lines exactly like they are:\n<br />bEnableFileSelection=1\n<br />bLoadLooseFiles=1\n<br />Save and close it, go back to SkyrimLauncher and enable the checkmarks i told before,\n<br />you are ready to enjoy the Draconic gear.\n<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />Draconic Armor And Weapon - Only for Males - Darker version\n<br />\n<br />Main file of the mod is required!\n<br />\n<br />Description:\n<br />Replaces the red textures of the Draconic gear with darker red textures.\n<br />\n<br />Installation:\n<br />First you have to install the main file of the mod and then the Darker version!\n<br />Copy the folder \"textures\" to Program FilesSteamSteamAppscommonskyrimData\n<br />and replace all files.\n<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />Permissions:\n<br />1) Users/Modders are not allowed to upload my files to other sites!\n<br />2) Users/Modders are not allowed to convert my file so that it works on similar games!\n<br />3) Users/Modders are not allowed to modify my file including releasing bug fixes or improving on the features my file adds to the game and upload it as a seperate file!\n<br />4) Users/Modders are not allowed to use assets contained in my files in their own files!\n<br />[b][i]5) Translations are allowed, no need to ask me.Â [/i][/b]\n<br />[b][i][u]6) Users/Modders are not allowed to upload my mods on Steam Workshop as their own to obtain money and it means the same for Permissions 2/3/4, my mods will always stay on nexus for free![/u][/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Credits:\n<br />Made by haldir307.",
