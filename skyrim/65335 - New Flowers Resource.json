The models are rather high poly, so don&#39;t use too many of them in one place.\r<br />Â \r<br />\r<br />[u]Potentilla[/u] (Finger shrub)\r<br />made from this free resource:\r<br />http://archive3d.net/?a=download&id=642d9727 by Sonia Ray \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]Blossom Ivy 01 and 02[/u]:\r<br />are retextures of the vanilla ivy with blossom textures from CG Textures\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]Vinca[/u] (Periwinkle)\r<br />is a retexture of the vanilla clover with a blossom texture from CG Textures. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The Vinca should be added as a tree to make the movement visible, I recommend to edit the vanilla clover for this.\r<br />\r<br />The flower bushes, Potentilla and Blossom Ivy are statics.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />=======================\r<br />\r<br />Ilona from archive3d.net for the Flower bush model\r<br />Sonia Ray from archive3d.net for the Potentilla model\r<br />CG Textures\r<br />The Niftools team for giving us Nifskope\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Permission:\r<br />===========\r<br />\r<br />You may use these resources in your mods as long as you give credit and you do not charge money for it. \r<br />You have to give credit to the authors of the original resources too as mentioned above if you use them in your mod.\r<br />\r<br />You may use this resource in Skyrim Special Edition too.
