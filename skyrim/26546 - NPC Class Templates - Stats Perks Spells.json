  "descriptionHtml": "[color=red]***********************************************************\r<br />I AM NOT ACTIVELY MODDING SKYRIM AT THE MOMENT.\r<br />\r<br />Anything I created is free for use and derivitive work. None of mods were complete and I apologize that some of them were never finished. If someone wants to pick up where I left off, they are welcome to use my work by either uploading their own mod or I can give them access to that mod&#39;s page. \r<br />\r<br />My custom work will continue as planned.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks everyone for your support and hopefully I will come back soon. But alas, I have a seasonal job and until April 15th, I don&#39;t know how much time I will have, or when I do have time, if I&#39;ll want to return to skyrim modding.\r<br />*********************************************************** [/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][b]Important: If you load this .esp in skyrim, it will do absolutely nothing. The NPCs have no ingame presence, nor do they change anything in game. This is a modder&#39;s resource.[/b][/color] \r<br />\r<br />[color=white]I got really tired of adding perks and spells by hand for every one of my followers, so I made this.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=white][size=3]What this is:[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[color=white]An .esp that adds 20 NPCs to the top of your actors list, each representing a different combat class available under the stats tab.\r<br /> \r<br />- Each NPC is given all perks for the 4-6 skills that are increaded by the class\r<br />- Each NPC is given all spells for any school of magic they are skilled in\r<br />- Each NPC has it&#39;s respective class already selected under the &#39;stats&#39; tab. [/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=white][b]They will be enormously overpowered if you leave them as is[/b], as I&#39;ve added [b]all[/b] perks for the 4-6 skills that receive bonuses for, for each class. For instance, the Assassin NPC has assassin stats, but also has all the perks for One-Handed, Archery, Light Armor, Sneak, and Alteration. He&#39;ll also have [b]all the alteration spells[/b]. To me, it&#39;s a lot easier to go through and click &#39;delete&#39; a few times than it is to add all the ones you want. [/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=white][size=3]Instructions:[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[color=white]What it&#39;s designed to be used for is loading in the CK with your own mods, and using the 20 NPCs I&#39;ve added as Actor Bases for your own NPCs. The only thing I&#39;ve changed on each of them is their stats, perks, and spells. [/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=white]1. Drop the incuded .esp in your Data folder\r<br />2. Load your mod and this one in the CK, marking your mod as active.\r<br />3. Create or open your NPC, Select one of the template actors under &#34;Actor Base&#34; on the left hand side.\r<br />4. Check &#39;stats&#39; and &#39;spell list&#39;\r<br />5. Uncheck &#39;stats&#39; and &#39;spell list&#39;\r<br />6. Set the Actor Base to &#39;NONE&#39; again\r<br />7. Navigate to the Spell List tab and delete whatever you want, or leave it as it is for one super overpowered NPC.\r<br />8. When you upload your mod, use the &#39;best skills&#39; document to make describing your NPC easier. (And totally give a shoutout to natilde cause u know u luff me)[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=white]Hopefully this will save you guys some time&#33; Let me know where I&#39;ve made mistakes. Would love to see someone get more creative with this than I have and make some specialized classes, or add combat styles&#33;[/color]",
