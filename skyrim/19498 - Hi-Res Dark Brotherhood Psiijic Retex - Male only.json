  "descriptionHtml": "This is a re-tex of Gyo\\'s DB Psiijic robes, found [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1854]here[/url]. Credit goes to him for the original textures. His mod is required to use this one.\r\n\r\nHowever, this re-tex is based on Art of Magicka\\'s version found [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1040]here[/url]. It is not required if you use Gyo\\'s version. In any event, I have included replacers for both. This is my first re-tex, so it\\'s far from perfect. Currently, this re-tex is for male bodies only, and will probably stay that way unless I get really really good at this overnight. \r\n\r\nI would also recommend [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10680]Psiijic Master Outfits[/url] by Apethnatos if you wish to make these robes craftable. Install Gyo\\'s mod first, then Psiijic Master Outfits, and then mine.\r\n\r\nTo install, use 7zip or WinRAR to extract the files to your Skyrim\\\\Data folder. Overwrite everything.\r\n\r\nAs for the robe, basically I wanted more black and red out of it, and I was very keen on the idea of a unique belt buckle, which neither Gyo\\'s nor AOM\\'s robe had. For my part, I have modified AOM\\'s version of the robe in the following ways:\r\n\r\na) Re-colored white trim on the shoulders and back to black.\r\nb) Re-colored white trim on robe and hood to red.\r\nc) Re-colored the piece behind the belt to a deep scarlet red.\r\nd) Re-colored pendant to red.\r\ne) Darkened belt face and added a bit of grit to it.\r\nf) Added a unique Dark Brotherhood seal in place of the original belt buckle.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest of the outfit, I swapped Gyo\\'s DB Psiijic boots with his Daedric Psiijic boots, for the simple fact they don\\'t have blood all over them. I also clothified them a bit more and slightly darkened them. I swapped out the eyes on the gloves with the same seal used on the belt, but it\\'s hardly noticeable and was more experimental than anything else.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind these are hi-res textures (4096x4096) and may not run smoothly on all setups, although mine isn\\'t the greatest and I have no problem handling them. Also, there is a bit of a sheen behind the textures in certain lighting that I really have no idea how to get rid of. I\\'ve tried darkening the rim but to be honest I haven\\'t really noticed the difference. Anyway, hope you enjoy it, and thanks to the awesome modders that inspired it. Without them, I couldn\\'t have done this, literally. ;] Please endorse this file if you use it!\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nzackdip @ [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1854]Psiijic Re-Skin several versions by Gyo[/url] for the original textures.\r\nZonzai & Kalell @ [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1040]The Art of Magicka[/url] for the version mine is based on.",
