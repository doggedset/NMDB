  "descriptionHtml": "----------------------------\r\nWindhelm Housecarl Calder\r\n(the Lusty Redheaded Nord Man)\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nMy first run through of Skyrim and getting my thanedom from Ulfric, I never adventured with Calder. However, when \r\n\r\nI did my second run through, I decided to give Farkas a break and test out my housecarl of Hjerim. He is a very \r\n\r\ncapable fighter, which I was surprised and funny. Take him to the tavern and just listen to him try to pick up \r\n\r\nthe ladies. :D\r\n\r\nMy version of Calder is not much different from Vanilla but I did a few little tweaks to him in order to look \r\n\r\nlike a \\'proper\\' fighter and not so pansy looking.\r\n \r\n\t1. I aged him to be around 40.\r\n\t2. I put a little bit of weight and height to Calder. So, ladies, you actually LOOK up to him.\r\n\t3. Changed his beard. Sorry, I don\\'t like mutton chops and it looked silly on Calder!\r\n\r\nTo make Calder look like the man in my promo images you will need these mods:\r\n\r\n\t1. Better Males Project by Chris57 and FavoredSoul \r\n\t   http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2488\r\n\t\r\n\t2. Seltkirk Armor from the Witcher 2 Models by LordOfWar\r\n\t   http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5588\r\n\r\nEnjoy! This is the first modified NPC for me and I am working on others as I envision them for my game.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------\r\nINSTALL\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nCopy the files into your /Data folder of your Skyrim game. It should then take precedence over the default load \r\n\r\nof Calder when you start your game up. \r\n\r\nContained Files:\r\n\t/meshes/actors/character/facegendata/facegeom/skyrim.esm/000a2c90\r\n\tHousecarlWindhelm.esp\r\n\tREADME.txt",
