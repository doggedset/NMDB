(Except some navmesh changes.DO NOT CLEAN THEM&#33;)\r<br />- Fixed a weaponplaque that did&#39;nt work properly.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Update 2.2:\r<br />\r<br />- Fixed the dagger rack in the bedroom\r<br />- Fixed 2 weapon plaques beeing out of place\r<br />- fixed a bookshellf right next to the alchemy table (left hand side)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I made a slim version of this mod for you who want a smaller version of this house, you can find it [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12522]here[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=&#34;5&#34;][b]Added:[/b][/size]\r<br />- New npcs, a totall of 5 excluding Drelas himself, all these are set to &#34;Very hard&#34; and they are hostile.\r<br />- Your Very own decorating stone, which will change banners in the house on a whim.\r<br />- Toggle your 2 fireplaces on or off, you can choose this yourself. ( they are induvidual, so you can turn the basement fireplace on and the livingroom one off for example.)\r<br />- Mannequins, weaponracks, weapon plaques.\r<br />- Dynamic lighting, all lights placed in the exterior and most lights in the interior is controlled by the time of day. (This function was in vanilla skyrim, i just added more lights to this home and added the emittance)\r<br />- A basement, with a bar, bookshelves and a new enchantment table.\r<br />- bookshelves also added to other parts of the house.\r<br />- A secret treasure room\r<br />- A short quest.\r<br />- A new bedroom and a smaller guestroom.\r<br />- A shack outside the house for blacksmiths ( i added no smelter because it did not look good and there is no mine anywhere close to the house.)\r<br />- A small shooting range outside..just for the fun of it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=&#34;5&#34;][b]Quest:[/b][/size]\r<br />A small quest needs to be completed before you can take ownership of this house, it still requires you to kill drelas, but the difficulty of this quest has been added, not recommended for low level characters, i did this because i don&#39;t think it&#39;s right that a level 5 should get a free house, nothing should come free. \r<br />[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange][size=&#34;5&#34;][b]Note&#33;[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />If you encounter a shieldbug, use these commands in the console and the shields should disable: (this should be fixed on all accounts now, but i leave it here just incase some of you manage to bug the shields again.)\r<br />\r<br />xx083f33.disable this will disable the shield inside\r<br />xx0854b2.disable to disable shields outside the house.\r<br />\r<br />* xx = where the plugin is in your load order, if it&#39;s number one, the number would start with 01.\r<br />\r<br />[b]&#33;&#33;&#33;If you are already using this house, please rememeber to empty any storage devices before you use this mod, the house has been changed completely&#33;&#33;&#33;[/b]\r<br />[/color]\r<br />\r<br />hope you enjoi the house.\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][size=&#34;5&#34;][b]Install:[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Put the fjollheimr.esp and fjollheimr.bsa into your datafolder\r<br />usually skyrim detects this and automaticly enables it, but it&#39;s good practice to always check the &#34;data files&#34; tab before you start the game to make sure it is enabled.\r<br />and done, enjoi&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=&#34;5&#34;][b]Uninstall:[/b][/size]\r<br />make sure you have emptied any storage device in the house, taken down weapons and armors from mannequins etc\r<br />Remove the fjollheimr.esp and fjollheimr.bsa\r<br />and done.\r<br />[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Want lanterns and fires to be hour controlled?
