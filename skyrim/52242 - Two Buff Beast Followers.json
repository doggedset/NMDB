  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]\r<br />[center][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65163/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/QtD7v94.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />I was kind of bored this morning, and figured it would be fun to try and make some buff and burly beast followers that my character could pal around with. I had some trouble while working and was [i]this[/i] close to just scrap the whole mod, but I persevered. So here we are&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The file has been cleaned with TES5EDIT, does not require any DLC, and has no scripts, so it should be safe for everybody to use. Still, you should always make a backup save before installing ANY mod, in case something goes wrong.\r<br />\r<br />Both can be hired just by talking to them, are in the marriage faction, and use their race&#39;s usual voices. I know Argonians can be married, but Khajiits can&#39;t in the vanilla game. You could try your luck with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36913/?]this[/url] mod, or use the alternative file I uploaded that changes the Khajiit&#39;s voice to MaleBrute ([url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Stenvar]Stenvar[/url]&#39;s voice) to ensure eligibility. \r<br />\r<br />They spend their time meditating or lounging around in a camp with two hay piles and a campfire North-northwest of The Apprentice Stone, which is abandoned in the original game. There is a map marker, &#34;Meditating Camp&#34;, which is visible but not enabled, so you&#39;ll need to visit before you can fast travel. Both followers will level with the player and prefer two-handed weapons and heavy armor.\r<br />\r<br />It does not show in the picture, but the Khajiit is wearing an amulet, and the lighing shows the Argonian to be kind of grey, but his skin is green in-game. All their apparel is unplayable, so it cannot be removed from their inventory. As all pieces of the mod are standalone, there shouldn&#39;t be many compatibility issues, unless you may have a mod that edits the cell [i]POITundra25[/i]. Since the mod was made with the vanilla Follower system, it should be compatible with any follower mod, such as the ever-popular [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14037/?]Ultimate Follower Overhaul[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15524/?]Amazing Follower Tweaks[/url].\r<br />\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use the Mod Manager to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I made this mod with modder&#39;s resources and items that were free to use, except for the bandanas, for which I got express permission to use.
