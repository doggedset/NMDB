  "descriptionHtml": "This file adds a Necklace of Waterbreathing to Brand-Shei\\'s strongbox in Riften. If you complete the side quest Distant Memories, then he will give you the key, or you can pickpocket it from him during the main quest.\r\n\r\nWaterbreathing items are pretty rare and I knew early on that I wanted to edit one into the game. It made sense to me that a Dunmer raised by Argonians would probably have a thusly enchanted item and making it a quest reward means that it doesn\\'t feel like a cheat.\r\n",
