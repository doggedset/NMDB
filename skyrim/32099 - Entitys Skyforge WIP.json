  "descriptionHtml": "Updates:\r\nThis mod is now available to those who use Open Cities mod\r\nLink: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8058\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nSkyforge. Legendary, Ancient, Mysterious, and Simple.\r\nSkyforge may have its amazing rep with most of Tamriel but, as most blacksmith\\'s have realized, Skyforge is missing key elements that help Blacksmiths create more than just armors and weapons. \r\nA Tanning Rack for making leathers and strips for fittings.\r\nA Workbench to improve your armors and shields.\r\nA Smelter to break down those useless ores and make ingots to forge your most powerful arsenal.\r\n\r\nSkyforge the way it should have been.\r\n\r\nAlright enough of the silly banter, This is actually a WIP. I\\'ve added the necessities and some other things that give this place a more supplied and stocked forge. Although as of now the added items do belong to Eorlund Greymane so none are for the taking (for those non thieving types).\r\n\r\nI also added in a joke item, guess what it is and where it came from? XD\r\nAnd for those who find this added item offensive. \\\"....I\\'m not apologizing\\\"\r\n\r\n!!!!Warnings!!!!\r\nAs this IS a work in progress I have not tested this with the famous scene in the companions line at the end. I will be testing that soon and fixing all problems, though if any are found period letting me know will make this go smoother in the long run.",
