  "descriptionHtml": "Hi guys&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This is my very first mod and I know I&#39;m late to the show (by about 4 years) but I just wanted to make a mod for fun. It&#39;s my first attempt at editing something in the game and I hope that if you download it you will enjoy whatever minimal content it has. This simply gives names to the automations that can be recruited as pets in the dwemer ruin of Kagrumez. It also makes these pets essential so they cannot die.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />-TheIceTurtleGod",
