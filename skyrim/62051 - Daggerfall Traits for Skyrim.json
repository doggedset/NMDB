Unfortunately like any good(?) nostalgia mod, that&#39;s not really possible; or at least far beyond my capabalities as a modder.[/size] Still, it actually works surprisingly well despite its limitations.\r<br />[center][b][u][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=6]\r<br />Requirements[/size][/font][/u][/b][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]- Skyrim\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863/?]Latest version of SkyUI[/url]\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19/?]Unofficial Skyrim Patch[/url] (technically optional but highly recommended)[/size]\r<br />[center][b][u][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=6]\r<br />Installation[/size][/font][/u][/b][/center][size=3]\r<br />\r<br />Place &#39;SkyrimTraits.esp&#39; and the folder &#39;scripts&#39; into Skyrim&#39;s Data folder (typically located in *&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;)[/size]. Alternatively, if you have Dawnguard installed you can use that version of the file instead. They&#39;re nearly identical except the Dawnguard version adds compatibility with Dragonbone weapons.\r<br />\r<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=6][u][b][center]\r<br />Uninstalling[/center][/b][/u][/size][/font]\r<br />[size=3]Run &#39;Uninstall&#39; from the Mod Configuration Menu in Skyrim, then save your game. Then delete &#39;SkyrimTraits.esp&#39; and in the scripts folder delete &#39;z_TraitManager.pex&#39;, &#39;z_StartupManager.pex&#39;, &#39;z_SkyrimTraitMCM.pex&#39;, and &#39;z_DamageOverTime.pex&#39;.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][u][b][size=6][center]\r<br />Using the Mod[/center][/size][/b][/u][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]When you first load a save you&#39;ll receive a note titled &#39;Medical History&#39;. Select it from your inventory to begin selecting your traits, or if you want you can select &#34;Play without traits&#34;. Positive traits cost points to select, and negative traits will provide you with more points. When balanced mode is enabled your point total must be greater than or equal to zero when you&#39;re finished selecting your traits, otherwise you will not be allowed to continue. Benefits and detriments that alter the same value or counter each other cannot be selected, for instance you cannot be immune and weak to the same element.\r<br />\r<br />Balanced mode can be disabled at any time from the mod configuration menu if you want, but keep in mind this setting will only work BEFORE you select your traits. Also, from the mod configuration menu you can choose to manually add the note to your inventory if for some reason you didn&#39;t receive one initially. The uninstall option will remove all of your selected traits and reset all of the settings to default, while I don&#39;t think it&#39;s strictly necessary to run this before uninstalling it certainly can&#39;t hurt, it can also be used to re-select your traits if for some reason they prevent you from progressing (or you&#39;re a filthy cheater).\r<br />\r<br />Traits will not show up on your active effects list, but rest assured they are doing their job. Effects dependent on the light level are not based on the time of day, but rather your exposure (or lack thereof) to light.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[center][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=6][u][b]\r<br />Traits[/b][/u][/size][/font][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]\r<br />Benefits:\r<br />\r<br />Adrenaline Rush - Gain a bonus to your attack damage and damage resistance while low on health.\r<br />Athletecism - +100 stamina.\r<br />Bonus against - Gain bonus damage against animals, humanoids, daedra, or the undead.\r<br />Expertise - Cause more damage with this weapon type.\r<br />Immunity - Gain total immunity to this element.\r<br />Rapid Healing - The rate at which you regenerate health is increased greatly.\r<br />Resist - Gain 50% resistance to this element.\r<br />Spell Absorb - Able to absorb hostile spells when not at full magicka, spells that fail to absorb cause massive damage.\r<br />Wisdom - Gain +50, +100, or +200 magicka.\r<br />\r<br />Detriments:\r<br />\r<br />Damage - Receive damage when in strong light or when inside temples and inside halls of the dead.\r<br />Dark Magic - Magical ability reduced or nullified entirely when not in darkness.\r<br />Forbidden - You cannot cause damage with this weapon type.\r<br />Light Magic - Magical ability reduced or nullified entirely when not in light.\r<br />Low Tolerance - Gain 50% weakness to this element.\r<br />Phobia - Cause reduced damage to and receive extra damage from animals, humanoids, daedra, or the undead.\r<br />Stunted Magicka - Cannot regenerate spell points normally\r<br />Weakness - Gain 100% weakness to this element.\r<br />Forbidden Material - Weapons and armor made of this material are useless when worn by you.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=6][u][b]\r<br />Troubleshooting[/b][/u][/size][/font][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]There are bound to be bugs or inconsistencies while playing, if you find something isn&#39;t working quite right or is prone to breaking let me know. This mod alters exactly one game setting so it&#39;s almost impossible for this mod to conflict with another, however some traits may undermine what other mods set out to accomplish so use at your own discretion.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=6][u][b]FAQ&#39;s[/b][/u][/size][/font][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]- HELP&#33; YOUR MOD BROKE MY SPELLS&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Aaaaa&#33; That&#39;s not my fault&#33; You probably chose the spell absorption trait and are absorbing your own summons, unfortunately this is a vanilla behavior associated with spell absorption. The Unofficial Skyrim Patch (mostly) addresses this, so if you haven&#39;t installed it yet I suggest you do so. It&#39;s also possible that someone edited or added a new spell and forgot to set their flags, so I suggest you let them know so they can possibly address this in future updates. Or you can keep bugging me until I make a patch, but keep in mind I&#39;m very lazy and probably won&#39;t.\r<br />\r<br />- MY WEAPON ISN&#39;T CAUSING DAMAGE&#33;\r<br />\r<br />You picked the &#34;Forbidden weapon&#34; trait, in Daggerfall you&#39;d simply be unable to equip that weapon, with my mod it makes it so that said weapon just doesn&#39;t cause damage.\r<br />\r<br />- BUT I PICKED &#34;SWORDS FORBIDDEN&#34; AND MY AXE ISN&#39;T CAUSING DAMAGE\r<br />\r<br />Also probably not my fault, somebody must have mis-labeled a weapon with the wrong keyword (or forgotten the keyword entirely).[/size]\r<br />[size=3]\r<br />- WHY DO I HAVE TO USE SKYUI?\r<br />\r<br />Well technically you don&#39;t [i]have[/i] to, I did add a config section to the note that shows up if SkyUI isn&#39;t installed, but to be perfectly honest I haven&#39;t thoroughly tested to see if it actually works. You&#39;re much better off just installing SkyUI, I promise you&#39;ll love it.[/size]\r<br />[size=3]\r<br />- &#34;X&#34; Trait was in Daggerfall, why don&#39;t I see it here?\r<br />\r<br />Because I couldn&#39;t implement everything properly. It might be possible if my mod existed in a vacuum, but the only implementations for some of these I can think of would have a solid chance at breaking things from other mods.[/size]",
