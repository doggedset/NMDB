  "descriptionHtml": "--------------\r\nSedethul\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Description:[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nAdds both one- and two-handed versions of Kit Rae\\'s Sedethul sword to Skyrim. Both can be crafted and improved. Black/silver and gold/brown variations are available.\r\n\r\nMeshes are to-scale replicas and use high-resolution textures taken from images of the actual swords.\r\n\r\nThis mod has two options: STANDARD and LARGER TWO-HANDER. As the name says, the second option includes a larger two-handed version of the sword that may not be realistic, but is closer in size to the vanilla two-handed weapons.\r\n\r\nSwords have Daedric damage numbers. The standard two-handed version has a reduced reach to compensate for its size, but the attack speed is faster than standard greatswords. The larger version has standard speed with a longer reach, but is heavier.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this small mod, or if you have any constructive criticism, please feel free to leave a comment and I\\'ll follow up as soon as I am able.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]How to get them:[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nVisit any forge. Both one- and two-handed swords will show up under the \\\"STEEL\\\" menu. Crafting info can be found in the images section.\r\n\r\nAlternately, you can add them via the console using the IDs below:\r\n- xx000D63 - One-Handed (Silver)\r\n- xx001829 - Two-Handed (Silver)\r\n- xx002858 - One-Handed (Gold)\r\n- xx002859 - Two-Handed (Gold)\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Installation:[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n- DOWNLOAD ONLY ONE VERSION\r\n- The easiest way is by downloading with the Nexus Mod Manager.\r\n- Alternately, unzip the .7z archive and copy all files/directories into your \\\"...\\\\Skyrim\\\\data\\\\\\\" folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Uninstallation:[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n- Delete said files. See above.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Updates:[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n08/10/2012\r\n- Released v1.02\r\n- Gold/brown version is now available.\r\n- Swords are now included under the \\\"STEEL\\\" category when smithing and improving. Steel smithing requirements and bonuses apply.\r\n- Released an alternate \\\"LARGER TWO-HANDER\\\" version for those who prefer larger two-handed weapons. The \\\"STANDARD\\\" version still uses a near-real-world scale.\r\n- Larger versions have vanilla reach and speed. Standard two-handed versions have reduced reach, but increased attack speed.\r\n- Some texture modifications and remapping.\r\n\r\n08/08/2012\r\n- All right, I took advantage of the server downtime to implement some fixes to mesh smoothing and blood maps. Uploaded v1.01 instead of a hotfix - they would\\'ve been similar in size anyway.\r\n- I\\'ve noticed a few \\\"minor\\\" issues that could stand to be fixed. Nothing too noticeable, but I\\'d still like to have them resolved. I always catch bugs right after I post a file *sigh* Anyway, I might post a hotfix or I might just wait until I\\'m done making some modifications I have planned for the next version. Depends on what time permits. \r\n\r\n08/08/2012\r\n- Released version 1.0\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Known issues:[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n- The grip on this sword is a bit short. When using the two-handed version, you may notice that the character holds the sword with one hand close to the pommel.\r\n\r\n- Blood maps are especially bloody. This was done intentionally.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Future Plans:[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n- Scabbards\r\n- Gold/brown version\r\n- Mesh optimizations",
