  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Fixed Followers Lite - By mangue[/b]\r\n\r\nThs is the ultimate follower fixer mod!\r\n\r\nFixes to bugs without changing intended stuff, keeping the game as the original developers wanted. It really only fixes bugs. 90% of the fixes will work with old savegames and new savegames.\r\n\r\n-== Currently in English, Russian, Spanish, German. (see misc files) ==-\r\n\r\n[b]=== FIXES TO ALL FOLLOWERS ===[/b]\r\n\r\nEvery follower in the game got these two fixes:\r\n\r\n1 - Fixed Hunting bow bug. You can just trade with them, remove their crap hunting bow and give them a nice improved bow. They\\'ll use it and never going to respawn this hunting bow again.\r\n2 - Changed level cap to 81. It varies but followers were capped on level 30, 40, 50. The only follower that would level with you past level 50 was J\\'zargo. Now all followers will level with you.\r\n\r\n[i]NOTE1: 81 is the maximum level a player can reach.\r\nNOTE2: These two fixes work regardles of your save beeing new or preexisted.\r\nNOTE3: Because there\\'s nothing \\\"mystical\\\" about the invisible bow anymore, followers will start using real ammo. They still have an unlimited invisible stock of iron arrows but will use only if they run out of good arrows.[/i]\r\n\r\n[i]Some followers have other problems that are also fixed. For example Lydia is now marriageable. You can know aditional fixes reading bellow:[/i]\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]HOUSECARLS - The bodyguards of nobleman[/b]\r\n[*]Argis the Bulwark\r\n[*]Calder\r\n[*]Iona \r\n[*]Jordis the Sword-Maiden\r\n[*]Lydia ( You can now marry Lydia. Works for new games or games that have never seen Lydia. Fixed walking and standing like a man. )\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]HIRELINGS - They follow you for gold and sometimes for glory[/b]\r\n[*]Belrand \r\n[*]Erik the Slayer\r\n[*]Jenassa - Fixed walking and standing like a man.\r\n[*]Marcurio\r\n[*]Stenvar\r\n[*]Vorstag\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[b][*]COLLEGE OF WINTERHOLD STUDENTS - They wish to master the arcane arts[/b]\r\n[*]Brelyna Maryon\r\n[*]J\\'zargo\r\n[*]Onmund\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]COMPANIONS - Skyrim finest join the Fighters Guild[/b]\r\n[*]Aela the Huntress\r\n[*]Athis (Skilled with heavy armor but was geared with light armor. Changed default outfit to heavy armor so the player doesn\\'t get confused and keep gearing him with light armor.)\r\n[*]Ria (Same as Athis)\r\n[*]Torvar (Same as Athis and Ria)\r\n[*]Farkas ( Altought a master heavy armor trainer, he sucked at it. He had wrong internal class blacksmith. He is now a two handed warrior with high heavy armor skill and decent sword / board skill as it was meant to be. )\r\n[*]Vilkas\r\n[*]Njada Stonearm\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[b][*]DARK BROTHERHOOD - We know...[/b]\r\n[*]Cicero\r\n[*]Dark Brotherhood initiate (Both male and female. Fixed a nasty bug which made all their items reset to default when you released them and went to the sanctuary to hire them again. Making you lose the items.)\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[b][*]DUNGEON FOLLOWERS - When you meet someone at the right time[/b]\r\n[*]Erandur ( The level cap is removed. Still there\\'s a bug on his quest. Check this link for details on how to avoid the bug http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Erandur )\r\n[*]Goldir\r\n[*]Illia ( She rocks but she can\\'t be rehired if dismissed. Check this link for details on how to try to rehire her http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Illia )\r\n[*]Note: Dungeon Followers are kinda buggy. Best to avoid them since there\\'s so much other good followers.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]MISCELLANEOUS FOLLOWERS - Nice people that will help you if you help them[/b]\r\n[*]Adelaisa Vendicci\r\n[*]Ahtar\r\n[*]Annekke Crag-Jumper ( She is a MILF. You can marry her daughter, Sylgja. Which can make her your follower and mother-in-law. =)\r\n[*]Aranea Ienith\r\n[*]Benor\r\n[*]Borgakh the Steel Heart\r\n[*]Cosnach ( Fixed using light armor instead of heavy armor since he\\'s a heavy armor warrior. )\r\n[*]Derkeethus\r\n[*]Eola\r\n[*]Faendal\r\n[*]Ghorbash the Iron Hand ( Fixed ranger using heavy armor. )\r\n[*]Kharjo\r\n[*]Lob\r\n[*]Mjoll the Lioness ( Fixed default invisible ring stuck to her. GAMES WHERE SHE WASN\\'T SEEN YET. Fixed walking and standing like a man.)\r\n[*]Ogol\r\n[*]Roggi Knot-Beard\r\n[*]Sven\r\n[*]Ugor ( Fixed ranger using heavy armor )\r\n[*]Uthgerd the Unbroken\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]=== IMPORTANT! ===[/b]\r\nI did this all in an unintrusive way. No code at all. Only configuration/editing so there\\'s no chance of breakage.\r\n\r\nI\\'m also not changing vanilla stuff without reason. The purpose of this mod is fixing annoying bugs while keeping the defaults.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== FAQ ===\r\n-Will you add X perk to a follower?\r\n If it\\'s not a bug, no. Like giving lightfoot to heavy armored warriors.\r\n\r\n-My beloved follower keeps reverting to his/her default outfit when I release him/her. Does your mod solve this?\r\n Not yet. I\\'ll fix it if I\\'m able to.\r\n\r\n-I\\'m having problem with marriage.\r\n Read this http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Marriage\r\n\r\n-My game is in the situation described that Lydia isn\\'t marriageable.\r\n There\\'s hope! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIpzzAvx52s&hd=1\r\n\r\n-Will you make all followers immortal?\r\n Sorry, no. This isn\\'t a bug. Some are really supposed to die and it gives the game more realism.\r\n\r\n-Can I use this mod with other mods that change followers?\r\n Pobably not safe. If you want to try, backup your saves.\r\n\r\n- OMG This mod sucks, it grew a mustache on Aela, made all NPCs fly, corrupted my save and killed my dog!\r\n Impossibru! Try unchecking some mods, restart the game, make sure it is really loaded.\r\n\r\n-Explain better followers level up.\r\n This mod sets their level cap to 81. About the stats, this is kind of a mistery. Most of the time stats remain the same between level ups. Some people, reported seen stat changes sometimes, as ou can see in this talk http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim_talk:Followers#Do_followers_level_with_you.3F\r\n\r\nThe creation kit and the official documentation is pretty straightforward, but the game doesn\\'t seem to obey the stat scaling, at least not for followers. Still it\\'s better than the original low level cap because if it really changes sometimes, there\\'s a greater range now. \r\n\r\n-What sites can I find this mod at?\r\nSteam http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=10203\r\nSkyrim Nexus http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9842\r\n\r\n\r\n=== TODO LIST ===\r\nMake the followers not go back to their default outfit when they are dismissed and go home.\r\nFix dungeon followers problems.\r\nFix followers using real ammo.\r\nFix level up not updating stats every time. (btw this happens in vanilla as well.)\r\n\r\n=== UPDATE HISTORY ===\r\n1.0 First release. Removed level cap and lots of other fixes described above. ( Not avaliable here in Nexus )\r\n1.1 Changed from no level cap to level 81 cap.\r\n1.2 Fixed female followers walking like men (Mjoll, Jenassa and the female housecarls) . Fixed Illia\\'s level problem (missed her in first release)\r\n\r\n=== OTHER STUFF ===\r\nIf you find any bugs or have suggestions just let me know.\r\n\r\nI will gladly answer everyone but If you ask something already answered in the description you get no response.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your support and feedback!",
