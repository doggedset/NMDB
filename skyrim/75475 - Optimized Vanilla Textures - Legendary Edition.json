It&#39;s what I&#39;ve been using for months and reduces the disk space needed for all of the game&#39;s textures.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6][color=#f1c232][b][font=Tahoma]Optimized Vanilla Textures - Legendary Edition[/font][/b][/color]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=4]There were three things that still annoyed me about [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57353/?]Optimized Vanilla Textures[/url].[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][size=4]Due to the various DLC everyone owned, multiple downloads and installer files were needed.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=4]Many textures were downloaded multiple times, both in standard definition and upscaled resolutions.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=4]No one seemed to know what to do with the load order and unofficial patches.[/size]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Well, the version of the mod that I&#39;ve been personally using solves all three of those issues. I&#39;m just going to assume that you have all three DLC and USLEEP. This makes a single download possible. And when you have a single download, you can get rid of all of the redundant textures. I also removed textures that were fixed in USLEEP but weren&#39;t also available in high-res forms. This means that USLEEP is the only place outside of Skyrim - Textures.bsa in which these textures exist. That being said, if you have USLEEP installed, you can delete Skyrim - Textures.bsa to save disk space. All textures are included between the two of them. Textures that are covered by USLEEP but also have high-res versions available are included, so this mod should be loaded after USLEEP. As always, you do not need the High Res DLC or the Unofficial High Res Patch if using this mod.\r<br />\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[b][color=#f1c232][size=5]Requirements:[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][size=4][url=http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/211720/]Dawnguard[/url], [url=http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/220760/]Hearthfire[/url], and [url=http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/226880/]Dragonborn[/url].[/size]\r<br />[*][size=4][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71214/?]USLEEP[/url] if you plan on deleting Skyrim - Textures.bsa after installation.[/size]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[b][color=#f1c232][size=5]Installation:[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][size=4]Download and install, overwriting USLEEP and nothing else.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=4]If you have USLEEP installed, you can delete Skyrim - Textures.bsa from your Data folder.[/size]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[b][color=#f1c232][size=5]Un-installation:[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][size=4]If you deleted your Skyrim - Textures.bsa file, have Steam run a game cache integrity check on Skyrim to re-download it.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=4]Uninstall via your mod manager.[/size]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#f1c232][size=5]Compatibility:[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]The textures here are &#34;loose.&#34; This means that any mod that tries to override them using a .bsa file will fail to do so.[/size]",
