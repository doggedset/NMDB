  "descriptionHtml": "Irish Gold version 4 for Skyrim by Joseph Melia\r\n28 nov 2011\r\n\r\nBecause in the current economy,It\\'s always good to make a bit of coin.\r\n\r\nI Was looking at the Euro coins by Skyrim Tutorials and decided to make a coin texture based on the old Irish coins,so I downloaded that texture to use as a template,as I can\\'t unpack BSA\\'s at the moment.Also I downloaded a couple of photographs of the old Irish 2 pence coin and got to work with paint.net for the texture and crazybump demo for the normals..I\\'m quite pleased with the result and I feel that they suit the setting as I\\'ve removed the date and Eire lettering to better fit the lore.. \r\n\r\nSo thanks to Skyrim Tutorials for the idea.\r\n\r\nRavenscar has made many useful suggestions about the coin which I tried to incorporate into it.\r\nxirishx has asked me to make it less bright,I have tried to do this and also balance out overall color.\r\nMabswear said it looked like copper,so I tried to shift the hue toward a more golden one.\r\nthe coin looks more rugged and worn now.\r\n\r\nEnclosed are a couple of in game screens of the finished product...\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\nPlace the Data folder into The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim main directory and choose yes to overwrite.(If you have a coin mod already installed,it will be overwritten,so you may want to create a backup first.\r\n\r\nIrish Gold v4 by Joseph Melia.\r\nYou may use or edit this texture as you see fit,but I would appreciate a quick mention if you use it as part of a mod.\r\n\r\nfeel free to comment or offer constructive criticism.\r\n\r\nenjoy.",
