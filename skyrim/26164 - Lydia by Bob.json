  "summary": "Just a fairly small tweak to Lydia - changed her face and made her smaller.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I know there are a million Lydia replacements out there but they either didn\\'t work or I didn\\'t like them so did this one just for me.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve tried to keep the sternness, and perhaps ruggedness, of features I might expect given her original appearance while making her somewhat cuter.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve also made her smaller (I like my women on the petite side), about 1.6m by my reckoning.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s just a minor tweak to the original, vanilla character so it shouldn\\'t cause any conflicts. This is, however, my first ever mod, so if it doesn\\'t work, please let me know!\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nJust put the \\\"LydiaByBob.esp\\\" file in the \\\"steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\" directory.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecommended mod:\r\n\r\nLydia lips fix by ziher (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11610)",
