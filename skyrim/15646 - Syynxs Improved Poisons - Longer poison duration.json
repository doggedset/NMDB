  "descriptionHtml": "This simple mod extends the duration of all poisons by 3-10 minutes and makes poisons unstackable.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n1: Getting hit by poisons or eating poisons was *no big deal*, since when in rpgs ever is getting poisoned so incredibly easy to shrug off? Now Cure Poison potions are much more important, be sure to keep one on at all times.\r\n\r\n2: Poisoning in vanilla is... aggrivating. Poison weapon, hit person, poison weapon, hit person. Ugh, now just poison someone once and you\\'re set, poisoning them again will only \\'refresh\\' the poison, it won\\'t stack to deal double damage.\r\n\r\nI recommend using this mod with my other mod \\\"Perky\\\", which adds many new perks to the game, a couple of which allow you to apply even more poison attacks per poison vial, and since the poisons no longer stack you can apply a poison, attack everyone once, then watch them die slowly >:3\r\n\r\nThis effect works on npc poisons, already existing poisons, all poison ingredients (eating a deathbell for example will poison you for a few minutes), dungeon trap poisons, and every other poison out there! (Some poisons don\\'t have an increased duration, Paralyze poisons for example would be overpowered and annoying if it did)\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re worried about 5 minute poisons dealing 50 damage per hit, don\\'t worry, the poisons will have their initial damage, then go into \\'afterpoison\\', where they deal less damage over a long period of time. There may be a poison or two I\\'ll need to nerf and when I find them I\\'ll patch it immediately.\r\n\r\nPerky: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12862",
