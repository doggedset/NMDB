Some of these are really epic, I recommend downloading this and looking through it yourself to pick out your favourites and use them. There is a total of 366 wallpaper image files (resolution 1440x900) included in this pack. Please endorse! :)\r\n\r\nUPDATE: After looking through all of these again, I noticed around four or five hiccups. I\\'m sorry for these stupid mistakes, but considering the fact that the 360 remaining pictures are completely usable, I wouldn\\'t worry about it. :P In addition, the example images are up! :D",
