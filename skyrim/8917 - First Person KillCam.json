  "descriptionHtml": "Description:\r\n\r\nThis mod forces the camera to be in First Person during Kill Moves.\r\n\r\nWhat it does:\r\n\r\nIt simply changes the chance of having the First Person camera to 100%. Nothing critical for the game itself was touched.\r\n\r\nAdvancement:\r\n\r\nThis plugin is still in Beta phase, so if you have feedback or encouter some weird camera behavior, don\\'t hesitate to comment, everything that will help improve the plugin is welcome ;)\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n\r\n- some kill moves don\\'t have a 1st person camera, so it may be possible to still see some kills in 3rd person (dragons, for example)\r\n\r\nPlanned for the future:\r\n\r\n- Use the player\\'s PoV to activate the correct cameras (1st person cams in 1st person view, 3rd person camera in 3rd person view)\r\n\r\nEnjoy !",
