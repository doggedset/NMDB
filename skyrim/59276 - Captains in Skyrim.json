  "summary": "This is a very simple mod adding 4 new Tribunes into the Castle Dour and 4 new Captains into Palace of Kings for immersive reasons.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Anyone ever felt it was wierd that the headquarters of the factions had no Captains stationed? \r<br />If you thought it broke a immersive wall between the reality of the Civil War and how it wanted to be portrait, then this little and very simple mod might help a bit.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve used Heavy imperial Armor on the Tribunes and the Stormcloak Commander on the Stormcloak Captians. Any mod that alters the look of the armor will work.\r<br />\r<br />The 4 Captains WILL fight you in the Civil War questline end. If not something is entirely wrong, please contact me if any issues arises.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Mod used to get the Imperial Heavy Armor reskin: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33772/?\r<br />Mod used to get the Stormcloak Captains armor reskin: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40216/?\r<br />\r<br />Recommended mods to build a immersive bridge: \r<br />New Legion Armor - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33772/?\r<br />Immersive Patrols - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33772/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Version history:\r<br />1) added 4 new Tribunes to Castle Dour\r<br />\r<br />1.1) Added 4 new Stormcloak captains to Palace of the Kings\r<br />\r<br />1.2) cleaned up strange voices for the Tribunes, everything should work as expected now.",
