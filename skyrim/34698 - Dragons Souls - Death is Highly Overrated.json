Script sources are included in the BSA and can be extracted with any suitable tool.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />When a mortal being dies under ordinary circumstances, their soul spills forth and leaks from Nirn into the dreamsleeve of Aetherius, where it will remain until a vessel needs filled. Here it will bask in a paradise of infinite raw magicka, not to see Mundus again until all former memories and experiences and traces of the previous holder have long since been scrubbed away. \r<br />\r<br />Not so for you, Dovahkiin, for within the fragile mortal vessel that keeps you bound to the earth rests the soul of an ever-lasting Dragon. \r<br />\r<br />Like the Dovah of old who are now awakening after all these years, you are an immortal child of Akatosh and can never truly die no matter how many times you are killed. Your soul can seek out a vessel on its own. \r<br />\r<br />Being a progeny of Akatosh whose birth was foretold of in the Elder Scrolls, you are bound by an implicit pact with the Divines. Visit any shrine of the Nine Divines, and they will grant you a refuge where your soul may gather when it loses its way. \r<br />\r<br />Be wary, however. Your soul can reach far across Skyrim in search of a new vessel, but your old vessel and its worldly belongings cannot. One who has journeyed far from home and temple halls would be wise to carry an Amulet of Arkay with them, for his domain is that of life and death, and his blessings will protect you accordingly. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Check the contained Readme for more details.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />No, seriously, check it.  I&#39;ll know if you didn&#39;t.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This mod is also available on Steam Workshop:\r<br />http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=138500606",
