  "descriptionHtml": "Hey guys, this is the first mod i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve uploaded, but i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve made many mods, this house took me acouple weeks to finish, I got a little sloppy at the end, but not too bad. It adds a massive dwemer themed house, which is slightly overgrown from the years, It includes a seperate room for each craft, a magic room, a combat room, library/grand hall, king sized bedroom, thieve room, assassin room, and a small cave to chill in! It is located at Evergreen Grove, i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll share a pic of where it is, well that pretty much it! I really hope you enjoy this mod, feel free to comment or anything else! If you have any questions or want to report a bug just send me a message, thanks!  ",
