Thanks! [/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[center][u]Story[/u][/center]\r\n[center]The Atheron family and Ambarys Rendar, being the richest Dark Elves in Windhelm,\r\nmanaged to buy large amounts of building materials from questionable sources in\r\nRiften, and relocated all the Dunmer out of Windhelm. Other Dunmer from around \r\nSkyrim joined them, and now the village is fully self-sufficient. (In the New \r\nAtheron Residence, there is a book written by Suvaris Atheron which contains an \r\naccount of the creation of the village - by the enchanting table)[/center]\r\n\r\n[center][u]Buildings[/u]\r\n*New Atheron Residence: The Atherons live here, along with the Thalmor Advisor.\r\nEnchanting Table and Alchemy Lab available, as well as an Enchanting Skill book.\r\n*The Burnt Dunmer Cornerclub: Ambarys Rendar\\'s new inn. Rentable room, as well as food/\r\ndrink - and a special room...\r\n*The Glimmering Moonstone: The village blacksmith. Crafting equipment: Forge,\r\nTanning Rack, Workbench and Grindstone. There is plenty of loot inside the house,\r\nmainly elven weapons and armor.\r\n*Sadri\\'s Magnificent Wares: Revyn Sadri\\'s new shop. Same services as before, but\r\nin a new building. There is also a Shrine to Zenithar\r\n*Hlaalu Farm: Belyn Hlaalu has given his old farm to Adisla, and has set up his\r\nnew farm in the Gray Village. As befits his family name, he has been given a great\r\nElven Sword, and is highly respected by other Dunmer.\r\n*Shrine to Azura: No Dunmer village would be complete without a tribute to Azura. \r\nThe Dunmer have recreated the Statue of Azura, and a priest has settled there.\r\n*Hunters Camp: A short walk away from the village lies a small camp, with a chest\r\nfilled with hunting loot.\r\n\r\n[u]New NPCS[/u]\r\n*Alanyis Atheron: Aval\\'s wife, she was living in a cave with her daughter after the \r\nWindhelm authorities took a dislike to her. She has now joined Aval once again.\r\n(Vendor - Spells)\r\n*Duthyl Atheron: Has been raised by her mother, but now serves as the Chief of the\r\nDunmer guards, and protects her father, Aval Atheron. However, she longs for the\r\ndays when she roamed Skyrim, and may be able to be persuaded to follow a worthy\r\nadventurer. (Follower)\r\n*Thanyir Atheron: Duthyl\\'s husband, and the village blacksmith. He took Duthyl\\'s \r\nname because, being an illigitimate child, he had no family name. \r\n(Vendor - Blacksmith)\r\n*Azyl Hlaalu: The priestess of Azura and mother of Thanyir, she came to visit her \r\nson\\'s wife, but decided to stay as she liked the village. She has also taken a bit \r\nof a fancy towards Belyn Hlaalu...and so decided to marry him!\r\n*Sanila Sadri: Revyn\\'s vampire sister was on the run from prejudiced Nords, but was\r\noffered shelter in the village. She aids Revyn with the shop - just don\\'t pick a\r\nfight with her! (Vendor - Misc)\r\n*Dunmer Refugees: These Dunmer are staying at the inn until they can afford to \r\nreturn to Morrowind. \r\n*Anunil (Thalmor Advisor): After Elenwen heard of the Dunmer\\'s rejection of the Nords,\r\nshe felt compelled to help her fellow Mer. At least that\\'s what she says - this \r\nadvisor is here to try to convince the Atherons to join the Dominion and oppose the\r\nEmpire.\r\n*Dunmer Guards: These Dark Elves used to be in the Dark Elf Army, but have fled\r\nafter the Argonian invasion. Now their military training is in use once again, as\r\nAval Atheron has employed them to protect the village from threats.\r\n*Thalmor Guards: Anunil has brought two additional troops to the village, who have\r\njoined the guard, and help to protect the village.\r\n*Hunters: A short walk from the village will bring you to a small hunter camp,\r\nwhere three hunters (2 Bosmer, 1 Dunmer) kill game to feed the Gray Village.\r\n(Vendors - Hunter)\r\n*Vorka Ork-Kin: Hireling/Potential Spouse in the Burnt Dunmer Cornerclub (Version 1.1)\r\n\r\n[color=blue][b]MORE TO BE ADDED LATER![/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[u]Installation:[/u]\r\n-Use [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/content/modmanager]Nexus Mod Manager[/url]\r\nor\r\n-Using [url=http://www.7-zip.org]7zip[/url] or a similar program, extract contents of 7z file into a temporary location, and then copy GrayVillage.esp into your data folder\r\n-Make sure that it is enabled in your Data Files section in the Launcher.\r\n\r\n[u]Bugs[/u]\r\n*Revyn Sadri may not enter dialogue with you, making it impossible for you to trade\r\nwith him - however, Sanila can be traded with, so you do not miss out upon general\r\ngoods trading.\r\n*Same applies with Alanyis Atheron.\r\n*Blacksmith may spawn underneath his house.\r\n*Followers cannot follow you into any new buildings.\r\n*Some of the packages may not work properly, I believe that this is a Creation Kit\r\nbug - this mainly applies to Ambarys Rendar and Aval Atheron (They seem to wander \r\nin the wrong places a bit).\r\n*Please report any if you find any!\r\n\r\nNOTE: I don\\'t know what is causing the listed bugs, and I do not know how to fix\r\nthem! If you have any ideas, please let me know, either by private message or by\r\nposting in the comments. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[u]Incompatibilities[/u]\r\n*Will not be compatible with any mods that edit the area, or mods that edit\r\nthese NPCs: Aval Atheron, Faryl Atheron, Suvaris Atheron, Malthyr Enthil, Ambarys\r\nRendar, Belyn Hlaalu, Revyn Sadri or Adisla. I Haven\\'t heard of any mods that do \r\nthis, but is probably wise to check!\r\n\r\n[u]FAQ[/u]\r\nPlease ask questions in the comments section, and I will answer them, and add any\r\nthat are asked a lot here!\r\n\r\n[u]Changelog[/u]\r\nVersion 1.0\r\n*The first version!\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n*Fixed the grey face bug\r\n*New NPC (See NPC list)\r\n*Renamed Burnt Dunmer for lore purposes\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2\r\n*Move Burnt Dunmer so that Dawnguard Quest \\\"The Bloodstone Chalice\\\" is not broken (NOTE: DOES NOT REQUIRE DAWNGUARD, IS JUST COMPATIBLE)\r\n\r\n[u]Future Updates[/u]\r\n*Fix Bugs\r\n*New NPCs\r\n*New Buildings\r\n*Possible Market\r\n*A Couple of Miscellaneous quests.\r\n\r\n[u]Permissions[/u]\r\nIf you want to do anything with this mod, please ask me, and I will tell you what\r\nyou can and can\\'t do.
