Non of this is included in this mod so I\\'m not sure what she will look like with your game, but as for her outfit, she will use whatever version of \\\"Tavern Wench\\\" that you currently have in your game, will need feedback on this from people who use other body/cosmetic mods, don\\'t be afraid to post pictures.\r\n\r\nI have reduced the original values for all the accessories and piercings, because they became insanely expensive when they turned into merchant items, so in order to reduce the prices considerably I needed to have high haggling perk which I don\\'t have, so I lowered their base values to half of the original.\r\n\r\nI have also removed the armor rating they had (piercings shouldn\\'t provide protection :P), changed their category from being lightarmor to be like regular Jewelry, all the items should be enchantable like regular jewelry as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=3pt]::::::::: Future Plans ::::::::[/size][/b]\r\nI will try to give her a daily routine like regular npc merchants (goes to other places, do other stuff during the day).\r\n\r\nThe current accessories and piercings are for the CBBEv3 body and some for bettermales body, if accessories for other bodies were made I will make a shop for them in this mod as well after I get the permission to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=3pt]::::::: Installation Instructions :::::::[/size][/b]\r\n[b]REQUIRED[/b]\r\n1- Download and install SED7 Accessoire Piercingset for CBBE3 and bettermales by Shazhar\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20655]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20655[/url]\r\n(Download the file named SED7-Allin1 Piercingset v1.4)\r\n\r\n2- Download my mod\r\n3- Either apply it manually, unpack it, copy the all contents from my archive and place it at game\\'s Data directory which is at steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\data and overwrite when asked.\r\nOr download my mod with NMM, install it through it, if it asks do you want to upgrade say NO and when it asks to overwrite say yes.\r\n4- Play the game, go to the BanneredMare inn, find Scheherazade and buy some piercings!\r\n\r\n[b]Note[/b]:\r\n1- You MUST install Shazhar original mod version 1.4 ALLin1 single esp before mine, without it, my mod is useless.\r\n2- My mod replaces Shazhar\\'s .esp file, if you no longer want my mod but want the original mod, follow the uninstall instructions then reinstall Shazhar\\'s original .esp\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=3pt]:::::::: Uninstallation Instructions ::::::::[/size][/b]\r\n0- If you bought a lot of piercings then you may want to sell them before uninstalling in order to get some of the gold you\\'ve spent back\r\n1- Get out of the BanneredMare inn, go somewhere else (some other cell preferably)\r\n2- Save\r\n3- Exit the game\r\n4- Uncheck SED7-CBBE3-BM_ALLin1-EDITION.esp\r\n5- Start the game and load the save you made last, click yes on the warning\r\n6- Make a new save in a new slot and exit the game\r\n7- Deactivate with NMM\r\n\r\nOR if you want to do it manually\r\nGo to Skyrim\\\\Data, delete SED7-CBBE3-BM_ALLin1-EDITION.esp\r\nGo to Data\\\\meshes\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\FaceGenData\\\\FaceGeom\\\\ then delete a folder named \\\"SED7-CBBE3-BM_ALLin1-EDITION.esp\\\"\r\nGo to Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\FaceGenData\\\\FaceTint and delete a folder named \\\"SED7-CBBE3-BM_ALLin1-EDITION.esp\\\"\r\n10- Done\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=3pt]::::::::: Incompatible With ::::::::::[/size][/b]\r\nNon that I know of..\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=3pt]:::::::: Permission :::::::::[/size][/b]\r\n[size=4pt][b]I got permission from [color=yellow]Shazhar[/color] to publish this little mod.
