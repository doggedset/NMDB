To disable this regeneration permanently you should use .modav instead of .setav. But .modav cammand works a bit differently. You also should use a negative value there.\r\n\r\nSo this is what you need to type in the console:\r\nplayer.modav healrate -0.7\r\n\r\nJust save after this and say goodbye to regeneration. \r\n\r\n;)",
