  "descriptionHtml": "Erandur is a pretty nice fellow to have around. He is a healer, but his shabby looks, and aversion to soap made him not so popular among the other members of my party. So we decided he had to get a little makeover.\r\n\r\nThe new Erandur is still pretty rugged, but in a manly way. :)\r\n\r\nHe now, in my opinion, looks more like the experienced mage and healer he ought to be.\r\n\r\nRequires Apachii hair.\r\n\r\n",
