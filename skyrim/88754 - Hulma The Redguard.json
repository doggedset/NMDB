  "descriptionHtml": "[center][font=Comic Sans MS][size=6]Hulma Sword-Singer Racemenu Preset[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/font][/center]   ﻿   ﻿[size=3]Hulma Sword-Singer, a sweet redguard lass. Her parents raised her in skyrim though she has always wanted to see hammerfell. She worked on her family's farm for several years until a skeever bit her father and he died of a disease. shortly after her mother ate herself into a permanent food coma caused by sweet rolls, and died. Hulma sold her family's farm and began wandering skyrim, homing her combat skills clearing ruins of undead, hunting down vampires, finding an odd attraction to Arkay she finds comfort in him and fights for him. Discovering the Dawnguard was a blessing for her she joined their ranks quickly and rose through the ranks to being one of their top Vampire Hunters and shes good at her job. After years of fighting honing her skills she began practicing the art of sword singing, creating a sword out of the essence of her own soul. she did this for a long time and mastered it fighting with power unmatched against the undead scourge of skyrim eradicating them from existence.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]As I said this is my first upload so please leave a comment if you like it I hope that somebody finds some enjoyment out of this.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][size=3]Required Mods --\n<br />The Eyes of Beauty: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722/?\n<br />KS Hairdos: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70363/? and https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68311/?\n<br />\n<br />Recommended mods for the same look --\n<br />CBBE: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666/?
