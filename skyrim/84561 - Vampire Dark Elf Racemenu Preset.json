  "descriptionHtml": "This is my own product. Its race is Vampire Dark Elf. I used [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25373/?][color=#ff0000][size=4]Original Vampire Races[/size][/color]\r<br />[/url] by [color=#ff00ff]Loshirai14[/color]. This is the requirement to have Vampire Dark Elf Race. Thanks for his work&#33;\r<br />\r<br /> We all know that it is difficult to create a beautiful dark elf face. I spent one week to finish my character face preset, 90 percent of work is done with sculpt button of Racemenu. I really thanks [color=#ff00ff]expired6978[/color] for his uploading [color=#ff0000][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?][size=4]RaceMenu[/size][/url][/color]. And i did not use any eyebrow, eyeball or any other parts of face mods. These parts i all choose default option provided by the original game.  Another mod i selected is [color=#ff0000][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/42049/?][size=4]Porcelain Pale Vampire Skin For Females[/size][/url][/color] by [color=#ff00ff]MissShazira[/color]. Thanks for his hard work. But you can still choose your own favorite skin texture. I used this mod [color=#ff0000][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57179/?][size=4]Female Hairstyles with Physics[/size][/url][/color] by [color=#ff00ff]Fuse00[/color]. I highly recommend this hairstyle for all of you. Its such an excellent mod by his hard working. Any body parts size if you don&#39;t like, you can choose body scale in racemenu to change. The armor and panty i wear is from [url=http://skyrimmodshighlights.blogspot.co.uk/2017/03/karlstein-cbbe-bodyslide.html]Karlstein full CBBE HDT[/url][size=4] [/size][size=2]and i am sorry that i cannot find author&#39;s name of this armor[/size]. And scarf and boots belong to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59202/?#][size=4]Sotteta Necromancer Outfit UNP[/size][/url]\r<br /> by [color=#ff00ff]nsk13[/color]. Thanks both of them for their high quality armors.\r<br />\r<br />I took photos at different times of a day, such as dusk, night and daytime and also in racemenu interface just to show the different effect of sun lights.",
