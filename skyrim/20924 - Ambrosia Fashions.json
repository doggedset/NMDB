  "descriptionHtml": "===DESCRIPTION===\r<br />\r<br />Various rextured outfits for the vanilla body. All items have a male and a female equivalent.\r<br />\r<br />A good variety of clothes here, from simple to fancy with some wild cards in there too - perhaps for the aspiring Sheogorath worshipper?\r<br />\r<br />The camp can be found just across the river from Riverwood, viewable from the saw mill. It has a safe storage chest and a few little extras so you can use it as a good starting base if you wish.\r<br />\r<br />===MAIN FILE===\r<br />Welcome to Ambrosia Fashions&#33;\r<br />In the main file you will find a small camp with safe storage as described as above and of course - the clothes. They are free to take in the main version.\r<br />\r<br />===NEW===\r<br />==MERCHANT EDITION==\r<br />&#33;&#33;&#33;PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE UPGRADING&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />New from Allison W, a modified .esp to reverse the fatal bee keeping accident so the Clothier is alive and kicking and ready to sell you her clothes&#33;\r<br />\r<br />****If you already have stored items in the safe storage chest please REMOVE your items from the safe chest BEFORE loading this mod&#33;****\r<br />(I also suggest making a clean save with Ambrosia Fashions unloaded before loading this version, but that&#39;s up to you&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />Changes in Merchant Edition: (for full changes, please see the ReadMe section.)\r<br />- The Clothier is now alive and has typical merchant gold etc\r<br />- She sells from 8am to 8pm\r<br />- Apiary (Bee Keeping) area clutter removed (since she&#39;s now alive)\r<br />- Enchanting table and equipment removed\r<br />- Potion chest removed\r<br />- SAFE CHEST FUNCTIONALITY REMOVED (this chest is now the Clothiers personal storage chest - she now has some possessions stored in here.)\r<br />-  Clothes values adjusted to more fitting values\r<br />\r<br />What This Mod Doesn&#39;t Do:\r<br />- The Clothier does not sell bee keeping items due to her vendor type. Bee keeping is more her hobby anyway...\r<br />\r<br />===USAGE===\r<br />***This is an .esp ONLY. You will ALSO need the original file for the textures etc***\r<br />- To use the Merchant Edition, uncheck the original AmbrosiaFashions.esp and tick AmbrosiaFashionsMerchantEdition.esp (use only one .esp&#33;)\r<br />- Full credit for the Merchant Edition goes to Allison W - who made all of the adjustments.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />===SE===\r<br />There is a non-merchant version especially for SE here:\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9206/?
