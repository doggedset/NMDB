  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Quieter Bears - by EliteKhajiit[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This mod lowers the volume of most bear sounds by 5 decibels.  There is an optional version to not have the loud bear idle sound at all(see video below).  I&#39;d suggest that for anyone with a pet bear.  \r<br />\r<br />I made this because there is only one other mod on the Nexus that does this, and it is incomplete.  Skyrim&#39;s default bear sounds are way too loud, and especially obnoxious if you have a pet bear. This mod DOES NOT lower the bear sounds so much that they sound weak.  They will still be loud and scary, but not excessively so. \r<br />\r<br />[b]This is what the No Idle Sound version does[/b]\r<br />[youtube]hP0XteQRDME[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />-----------------------------\r<br />\r<br />[i]Installation[/i]\r<br />\r<br />For Mod Organizer, simply install the mod and make sure it&#39;s activated.  \r<br />\r<br />For Nexus Mod Manager, it should install the same way, but I don&#39;t use it so I&#39;m not entirely certain. \r<br />\r<br />For manual install, extract contents into [i]skyrim&#92;data[/i].\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[i]To uninstall[/i]\r<br />\r<br />If you use the non-bsa version, delete the [i]bear[/i] folder at [i]skyrim&#92;data&#92;sound&#92;fx&#92;npc&#92;[/i], or let your mod manager do that for you. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]------&gt;Non-bsa version users should delete the folder before any upgrade, or if changing to the bsa version &lt;------[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[i]Compatibility[/i]\r<br /> \r<br />Should be compatible with all mod, as long as they don&#39;t change the bear sounds. Make sure the esp is placed after any mods that alter the bear sounds in your load order and you should be fine.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />All files were extracted from the skyrim [i]sounds.bsa[/i], are in wav format, and at 16-bit 44100hz.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-----------------------------\r<br />\r<br />[i]Update notes[/i]\r<br />\r<br />-v1.1(formally v0.2) \r<br />[i]*Removed several attack sounds that were made too quiet.  non-bsa users delete all files for a proper upgrade.[/i][b]  I changed the version number from 0.2 to 1.1.  If your mod managers says have 0.2, then you are up to date.  Sorry for the inconvenience.  If you have version 1.0, then you need to update.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-----------------------------\r<br />\r<br />[i]My other mods[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56985/?]Convenient Horses - Only Short Whistles[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56491/?]Dwemer Clutter into Dwarven Ingots[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56550/?]Collars into Ebony Ingots[/url]",
