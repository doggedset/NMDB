  "modName": "Craft Lunar Weapons",
  "summary": "Lets you craft Lunar weapons at the Lunar forge.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I must say that the Silent Moon effect is one of my most favored enchantments in Skyrim, as they  are supposed to do more damage at night. Firstly, this mod alters the text of the book &#34;Notes on the Lunar Forge&#34; (found at the workbench in Silent Moons Camp) more or less. The main purpose of this mod is that you can now craft Lunar weapons, but only at the Lunar forge between 9 pm and 5 am. From onehanded iron weapons to onehanded dragonbone weapons. Like their unenchanted forms, they require the same materials plus a filled Grand Soul Gem.\r<br />\r<br />This mod also includes a plugin that fixes the Lunar enchantment so it actually deals damage and sets the victim on bright fire.\r<br />\r<br />What&#39;s new in 3.7? The spell you get from the spelltome &#34;Lunar Weapon Crafting&#34; is no longer required, but you still get the Fortify Smithing bonus from it. It&#39;s been hidden at the place where you first have to climp atop the walls then jump in.\r<br />I&#39;ve also placed several ingots and a few other materials within the camp that are needed to craft some of the weapons. I thought it would make a nice start.\r<br />\r<br />Requires Dawnguard.\r<br />\r<br />Incompatibility:\r<br />-Any mod that alters the forge at Silent Moons Camp such as &#34;BadGremlins Items of the Moons&#34;.\r<br />-Mods that change the magic effect &#34;dunSilentMoonsEnchFFContact&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />Future plans:\r<br />-Will fix further bugs if there is any.\r<br />-Will add the rest of the basic weapons (twohanded, bows, etc..)",
