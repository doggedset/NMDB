  "descriptionHtml": "[color=orange][size=3]Riverwood Mercenary Guild 1.2[/size] (by Volek)[/color]\r\n\r\nThe Mercenary Guild is a new building in Riverwood. \r\nThere are 7 different mercenaries of different classes, each with class specific equipment, perks and spells.\r\nThe following mercs are available: Eladrel (Storm Mage), Tama (Ranger), Darmok (Berserker), Jalad (Monk), Shantil (Rogue), Dathon (Warrior), Tanagra (Conjurer).\r\nYou can hire all mercs at the same time, they don\\'t add to the normal follower count.\r\nOnce hired, they will follow you and help in battle. You can give the following orders:\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Wait at the current position\r\n[*] Wait at the targeted location \r\n[*] Follow (if waiting)\r\n[*] Attack an enemy target\r\n[*] Trade (optional sharing script available)\r\n[*] Set home base to current location (works for each merc individually)\r\n[*] Dismiss to the previously marked home\r\n[*] Push (useful in narrow spaces)\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nNoFear88 created a variation of this mod: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22060]Akaviri Warriors Guild[/url]. It\\'s basically the same mod, but in a different location and with different characters, so you might wanna check it out if you aren\\'t too fond of my characters. Both mods are compatible.\r\n\r\nHere\\'s a FAQ that should answer most questions that might come up, please read it before posting in the comments section.\r\n\r\n[color=orange]My preferred mod manager won\\'t install it correctly, what can I do?[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]Open the zip file, extract the Data folder from the archive to your Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\ folder.\r\n   Start the Skyrim Launcher, click Data Files and make sure MercenaryGuild.esp is activated.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Is this mod lore-friendly?[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]The Guild does not exist in TES lore, but I tried to make it as immersive as possible.\r\n   All NPCs in this mod have their own little background story.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Where is the Mercenary Guild?[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]Near the west wall of Riverwood, a big house with front steps.\r\nIf you installed the update, the building is south of Ivarstead, north of the Imperial camp.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Why do the house and the NPC faces seem familiar?[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]The house is based on the Candlehearth Inn. I just changed a few rooms and added furniture and crafting tools.\r\n   All NPCs have the faces of existing NPCs, it\\'s a cheap workaround for the greyface bug.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]How do I hire a merc?[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]Follow the in-game instructions.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Why are the contracts so expensive?[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]All mercs are essential, some are probably overpowered. \r\n   If you played the game for a while, you should have tons of gold anyway.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]But I don\\'t have the gold, and I\\'m not a cheater![/color]\r\n[color=yellow]Try to steal the contracts. The Guild Master will sleep at night.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Do I have to keep the contract with me all the time?[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]If you don\\'t, dismissed mercs will return to the guild hall instead of their home.\r\n   You can\\'t hire or re-hire them without having the contract in your inventory.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]I can\\'t talk to anyone, the dialogue choices won\\'t appear.[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]Open the console and type \\'\\'stopquest vvvMercQuest\\'\\' followed by \\'\\'startquest vvvMercQuest\\'\\', without quotes.[/color]\r\n\t\r\n[color=orange]I can access their dialogue, but cannot select anything.[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]Quicksaving and Quickloading should solve it.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]They talk to me, but why can\\'t I hear anything?[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]No voice acting. The sound files are blank placeholders, to make the subtitles readable.\r\n   Feel free to do the voice acting, you may also re-write the dialogue if you like.\r\n   Send me a PM if you wanna volunteer for this task.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]I hired some mercs, but they won\\'t follow me or my orders.[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]Having too many followers may cause issues with the navmesh or the AI packages.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]My followers randomly teleport around.[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]Same as above, dismissing some followers should help.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]They won\\'t harvest or pick up anything.[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]You\\'re such a slob, pick it up yourself! (jk, these commands are bugged)[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Why can\\'t I share anything with them like with normal followers?[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]These mercs are not sworn to carry your burdens.\r\n   Download and install the optional script if you want to misuse them as pack mules.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Will they equip better armor and weapons?[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]Not tested yet, should work with weapons, not sure about armors.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Will they auto-dismiss after 3 days of waiting, like in the vanilla game?[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]No, they will wait until told otherwise. [/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]I dismissed them, now I can\\'t find them at the place I marked as home.[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]Walking home might take a while, on arrival they will wander around, use workbenches, furniture etc.\r\n   Also make sure you didn\\'t confuse the place, each merc can have their own home.\r\n   If you have not marked a place yet, they will return to the Guild hall.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]I don\\'t wanna push them around, can\\'t they just step aside when blocking the way?[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]I tried to make that work, but failed. If someone has an idea that doesn\\'t involve flee packages, hit me up.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Is this mod compatible with other follower mods?[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]Yes, it\\'s a completely new system and should not conflict with other mods.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Is it compatible with other mods that add stuff to Riverwood?[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]Should be, unless a mod adds something at the same place.\r\n   There might be Navmesh issues if another mod adds new buildings west of Riverwood.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]I don\\'t like the faces/names/dialogue/equipment/spells/house/whatever.[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]Feel free to load it into the CK and change anything you like.\r\n   Just let me know if you wanna upload something.[/color]\r\nOr check out the Akaviri Warriors Guild by NoFear88!\r\n\r\n[color=orange]I found a bug that has not been mentioned in the FAQ yet.[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]Please send me a PM, or write a comment.\r\n   Describe the situation and the bug in detail.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Will there be updates?[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]Currently, all known bugs are impossible for me to fix.\r\n   I might update the mod if i ever get hit by a flash of genius.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]How do I uninstall the mod without a mod manager?[/color]\r\n[color=yellow]Deactivate and delete MercenaryGuild.esp.\r\n   In the Scripts and Scripts/Source folders, delete all files that begin with vvvMercenary.\r\n   In the Sound/Voice folder, delete the MercenaryGuild.esp folder.[/color]\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion history:\r\n1.2 - fixed crashes and disappearing building, all mercs have minimum level of 10\r\n1.1 - removed unnecessary navmeshes and references, fixed wall in Guild Master\\'s room, some minor fixes\r\n1.0 - initial release \r\n\r\nLegal stuff:\r\nFeel free to use any assets of this mod in yours, just give credit and let me know about it.\r\nFeel free to update the mod, just let me know before you release it.\r\n",
