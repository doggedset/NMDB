The build that is supposed to be used with this preset can be found [url=https://tamrielvault.com/groups/topic/view/group_id/3/topic_id/9856/post_id/123164]here[/url].\n<br />\n<br />The character is a male Argonian, primarily green with red being a complimentary color around the cheeks, nose, forehead, and eyes. I recommend using Arthmoor's Alternate Start-Live Another Life mod to begin the game as a Vampire Lord and see the preset as it was intended to look.",
