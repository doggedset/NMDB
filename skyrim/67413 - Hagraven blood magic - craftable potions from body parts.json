  "modName": "Hagraven blood magic - craftable potions from body parts",
  "summary": "so i was bored and wanted to be a hagraven for a while, and turns out i can&#39;t, so i made this mod as a failed attempt lemme imagine i&#39;m a hagraven and brew some potions made of animal and human parts. enjoy.",
  "descriptionHtml": "make some potions from dead animal parts. potions are made from hides, claws, teeth, skulls, bone meal, soul gems, etc. soul gems are based on how strong the creature is and what soul it has when you soul trap it. \r<br />\r<br />potions are added to a new crafting station called the hagraven bloodbowl, which is literally what the item was called in the creation kit id. it is added throughout skyrim in 45 different locations, specifically hagraven and forsworn areas. \r<br />\r<br />i made this to give some purpose to the creepy looking bowl of blood, with spriggan body parts for holders. now instead of being cool looking, you can use it for your malevolent magical purposes.\r<br />\r<br />i also made this for minor immersion, as in the lore, witches and hagravens can create potions, specifically cures for lycanthropy and vampirism. well i got the create potions part down. o and using the bloodbowl does not increase your alchemy, its supposed to be blood magic, not alchemy, so bam&#33;\r<br />\r<br />originally, i was going to have the potion effects last permanently, but that would have been very overpowered. \r<br />\r<br />future updates? well if people want one, i may see about doing a version that cures being a werewolf and vampirism, but honestly, there are plenty of mods that do that already, and not to mention the thousand mods that alter werewolves and vampires, so doing this may affect those mods, which i dont want to happen. \r<br />if you have ideas for how i can improve this mod, feel free to say.",
