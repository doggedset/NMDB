  "descriptionHtml": "[center]I always thought it was a bit weird that in order to have fertile soil you needed to buy land from the Jarl. I mean...what&#39;s stopping you from finding a patch of ground somewhere and growing your own stuff? Is the Jarl of a Hold so petty he&#39;s going to issue a cease and desist for you growing some Red Mountain Flowers in that sunny spot behind the trader?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />To that end comes the Soil of Falkreath. Throughout the hold of Falkreath there are now [b][i]100 plots of fertile soil[/i][/b] for you to plant whatever you want. Make camp somewhere you find a patch of fertile soil and grow what you need. Best used for role-play I think, with RND or a like mod. The soil has been hand placed in places where it makes logical sense, but also in a few surprise locations. Hunt around.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]HEARTHFIRE REQUIRED&#33;&#33;[/u][/b][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Why only in Falkreath? Well because it&#39;d take forever to do the whole of Skyrim and Falkreath is my favourite hold. I&#39;ll do the other holds later one by one and then have a merged version (lord knows when that will be though)\r<br />\r<br />Feedback, error reporting, suggestions for which hold to do next or even places in Falkreath soil wouldn&#39;t go amiss are welcomed",
