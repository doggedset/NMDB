  "summary": "Removes the red screen and blur effects from the Berserker Rage power. Made as a request.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a very simple mod it only removes one line of code from the power to prevent the IMOD from activating. It should be compatible with pretty much any other mod as long as it does not effect the Berserker Rage power. There should be no performance loss. It should be fine to use on a current save file as long as you are not saved in the middle of the power being activated.\r\n\r\nThis mod was made as a request.\r\n\r\nTo install the mod just extract the file and place in your Skyrim data fold, and then make sure it is checked under the data files section of the Skyrim launcher.\r\n\r\nAlternatively download and save the archive. Open the Nexus Mod Manager and press add mod from file. Choose the zip file and press open. Activate the mod.",
