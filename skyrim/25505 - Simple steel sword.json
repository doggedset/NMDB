  "descriptionHtml": "I made this sword a while ago, and thanks to Phate3 it works in game.\r\n\r\nI figured i could share it with other, so i\\'m uploading it now\r\n\r\nIt\\'s basically the sword from The legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, but I made the hilt black and left the hole at the part at the end of the hilt, since i like it more that way.\r\n\r\nit\\'s pretty strong... I don;t like slashing my enemy\\'s for 5 minutes before he FINALLY dies, so it is a lethal blade, not one hit kill, but lethal.\r\n\r\nit\\'s a one hander, found in the steel catagory in the crafting screen\r\n\r\nif you want to implement it in your mods, you can do that, just send me a message that you did. maybe i also want your mod xD\r\nand please credit me\r\n\r\n\r\n",
