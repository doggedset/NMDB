  "modName": "Repaired Cathedral of Volkihar -Dawnguard-",
  "summary": "Fixes the Cathedral in Castle Volkihar to be fitting for the Daedric lord of domination, Molag Bal, and yes I\\'m certain that\\'s not Mehrunes Dagons rule. Spoilers lay ahead, by clicking this file you wave all rights to complain about how I spoiled your game and all that.",
  "descriptionHtml": "First off SPOILERS AHEAD, I dealt with morons before that whine about spoilers in my files even though I had clearly made a spoilers tag, so by clicking this file you wave all rights to complain about how I spoiled your game and all that, if you complain of such you will be made light of your ignorance.(if you do this as a joke you will be treated the same)\r\n\r\nNow onto the important stuff, this mod changes the cathedral of Molag Bal in castle Volkihar, the independent cell version, not the one you wake up in when you become a Vampire Lord, to a cleaner, more repaired version, there are minor issues with the balconies but other than that there should be no issues, I aim to expand this mod as I get new ideas, which you are welcome to offer, as right now(first upload) the room is just a cleaned up version of the original, no frills or anything, its is very plain and the only thing worth noticing is the altar of Molag Bal, this file should be compatible with the end of both quest lines but I don\\'t recommend it because it breaks immersion, I also only recommend it to vampire lord characters who have killed Harkon(told you there would be spoilers)and have claimed the castle as there own, this mod is not meant for Vampire Hunters",
