  "descriptionHtml": "[img width=839,height=370]http://s4.postimg.org/dwl38zb8t/Manga_Skyrim.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Rejoice&#33; All of your anime looking followers and custom voiced, Japanese speaking companions will finally fit into Skyrim&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The Japanese Skyrim Dialogue guide is a short, easy to follow and adequate guide on how to change your Skyrim Language into Japanese. (And on how to change it back to english with the click of a button.)\r<br />\r<br />This is a guide primarely for Mod Organizer users. It will probably work with Nexus Mod manager, but I haven&#39;t tested it myself.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Step one: [/b]\r<br />Go to your steam library. \r<br />Right click Skyrim.\r<br />Select: &#34;properties.&#34;\r<br />Now press the language tab.\r<br />Select Japanese. (Wait while skyrim changes your language.)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Step two:[/b]\r<br />Navigate to your Skyrim Data folder. (The default place for this is Computer&gt;(C:)&gt;Programfiles(x86)&gt;Steam&gt;Steamapps&gt;Common&gt;Skyrim&gt;Data\r<br />In the data folder locate Skyrim - Voices.Bsa and Skyrim - VoicesExtra.bsa. Copy these and put them in a folder on your desktop called Japanese Skyrim Voices. (You create this folder yourself.)\r<br />if you have Dawnguard, Heartfire and Dragonborn installed, place dawnguard.bsa, heartfire.bsa and dragonborn.bsa in the folder you just created, as well.\r<br />Right click your bsa files one at a time and choose &#34;add to archive.&#34; These files can now be loaded into Mod Organizer as mods.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Step three:[/b]\r<br />Go back to your steam library. \r<br />Follow the instructions in step one, but this time choose English as your language. (Wait while Skyrim changes your language.)\r<br />Go into Mod Organizer and select &#34;install a new mod from an archive.&#34; (The disc symbol in the top left corner.) \r<br />Navigate to your Japanese Skyrim Voices folder and add the archives to Mod Organizer. Put the Dawnguard.bsa after your dawnguard.esm, your Hearthfire.bsa after your Hearthfire.esm and your Dragornborn.bsa after your Dragonborn.esm\r<br />\r<br />Put the Skyrim - Voices.bsa and the Skyrim - VoicesExtra.bsa wherever you want them. They should be placed towards the bottom of your mod order so that they overwrite any conflicting mods. Activate all of the .bsa files.\r<br />\r<br />Profit&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Your Skyrim Dialogue should now be Japanese. If you want to change it back to English, simply turn off the Japanese .bsa mods you created.\r<br />\r<br />Remember to turn on subtitles via ingame settings for the Japanese version.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br /> ",
