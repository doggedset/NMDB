  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5][center][color=#ffff00]Nemesis Shrine[/color][/center][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />You must find the book &#34;Souls Black and White&#34; and travel to the circle of ruins near Rorikstead to activate the shrine.  The shrine will activate and you can fight a copy of yourself to claim a dragon soul.\r<br />\r<br />This is my entry for the /r/skyrimmods Boss Battles Contest, but is not finished to the level I would like.  Head over to the site and vote:\r<br />[center]\r<br />[u]http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/324wma/skyrim_modding_contest_2_submission_thread/[/u][/center]\r<br />\r<br />The balance of the Nemesis may be wildly off depending on your level of progress. Some things I would like to add eventually are:\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Scaling of weapon and armor temper for Nemesis (default 2.0 item health now)\r<br />[*]Adding proper enchantments to nemesis gear\r<br />[*]Allow nemesis to turn into a skeleton on death like dragons do (this is done via custom armors, as changing the race of the nemesis changes the race of the character)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />There are a few bugs but overall this should be a fun battle (watch out, the nemesis will use shouts, it seems to prefer the &#39;Ice Form&#34; shout&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />If you are having trouble finding the required book to activate the shrine, I have &#39;conveniently&#39; placed one in Wolfskull Cave on the main altar.",
