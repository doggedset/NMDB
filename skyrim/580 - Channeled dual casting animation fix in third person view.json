  "summary": "Fixes the extremely jerky animation while channeling a spell and turning in third person view.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Video showcasing the difference: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ebe7MT6D1mQ\r\n\r\nUPDATE: removed some unnecessary files that modified other animations too. This is only a temporary fix, until better one is made and when the modding tools are finally released. :)\r\n\r\nTo Install: just unpack the files into your Skyrim\\\\data\\\\meshes\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\animations\\\\ folder.\r\n\r\nManaged to fix the third person channeling animation to stop switching between two different stances if you moved your mouse. Also improves the aiming of the channeled spell a lot by having it not move around as much while turning.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can improve this, please do. :)",
