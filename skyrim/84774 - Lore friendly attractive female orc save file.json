  "descriptionHtml": "thought i'd try my hand at making an attractive female orc, i think i did pretty good so i thought i'd upload the savefile so you guys can play with it if you want. no mods should be required, i used no face mods so your appearance may vary. \n<br />\n<br />i was messing around before uploading this so she has a lot of health/stamina/magicka for a level 1 character. you can either keep it or change it yourself by opening the console and typing player.setav health,magicka,stamina [whatever you want]Â \n<br />\n<br />to install just move the file into your savefile folder. default is documents/my games/ skyrim/saves. enjoy.",
