  "descriptionHtml": "Takes Hunterborn&#39;s Living Take Time patch, which included support for the original Frostfall, and updates the scripts for the new Campfire/Frostfall3 release by Chesko.  No longer supports the original frostfall (will be added back later)\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m working on a complete Living Takes Time framework to make it easier to add support for new mods without having to keep replacing the core scripts.  The intention is that a new mod can provide an additional pex file (maybe with esp) and it will handle the activities that take time in that mod.\r<br />\r<br />Features (Campfire/Frostfall only)\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]All crafting items moved from chesko_frostfall.esp to campfire.esm\r<br />[*]Firecraft abilities take reasonable amounts of time\r<br />[*]Firecraft perk optionally improves firecraft times\r<br />[*]Crafting snowberry extract handled for frostfall.esp if it exists\r<br />[*]None of the original capabilities, nor those of the other included mod timings, have been modified\r<br />\r<br />[/list]\r<br />Known Issues:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]FISS saving of settings were not updated for Hunterborn, and still have not been updated.  Will be fixed by 1.0 release.\r<br />[*]I have no idea if this will work on a dirty save, probably will be buggy with leftover unreferenced variables.  You probably should disable Living Takes Time, save, quit, start, enable and check settings in MCM.\r<br />\r<br />[/list]\r<br />Installation Instructions:[list=1]\r<br />[*]Locate your ...&#92;Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;Scripts folder\r<br />[*]Open the archive\r<br />[*]Copy three RTT*.pex files into your ...&#92;Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;Scripts folder\r<br />\r<br />[/list]",
