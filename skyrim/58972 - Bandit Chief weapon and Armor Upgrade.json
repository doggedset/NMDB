  "summary": "Adds to the Bandit Boss leveled list: Glass, Ebony, Daedric, Dragonplate armor (boots, cuirass, gauntlets)\r<br />And Daedric weapons (greatsword, warhammer, battleaxe, war axe, sword, mace)\r<br />removes helmets and shields from Bandit Boss leveled list.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Previously, a bandit chief would spawn with, at best, steel plate armor (nordic carved if dragonborn dlc is active) and ebony weapons. They would have steel plate armor when the Â player character is at or above level 18, they would have ebony weapons when the player character is at or above level 36. This modifies the leveled lists so that at higher levels, bandit chiefs will spawn with better equipment.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b]DO NOT REUPLOAD TO STEAM WORKSHOP[/b]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />Adds to the Bandit Boss leveled lists\r<br /> (item), (level)\r<br />\r<br />v2:\r<br />Armor:\r<br />Glass Boots, 28\r<br />Glass Gauntlets, 28\r<br />Glass Cuirass, 28\r<br />Ebony Boots, 37\r<br />Ebony Gauntlets, 37\r<br />Ebony Cuirass, 37\r<br />Daedric Boots, 45\r<br />Daedric Gauntlets, 45\r<br />Deadric Cuirass, 45\r<br />Dragonplate Boots, 50\r<br />Dragonplate Gauntlets, 50\r<br />Dragonplate Cuirass, 50\r<br />[Random. 52]*\r<br />\r<br />Weapons:\r<br />Daedric Sword, 45\r<br />Deadric Waraxe, 45\r<br />Daedric Mace, 45\r<br />Daedric Greatsword, 45\r<br />Daedric Battleaxe, 45\r<br />Daedric Warhammer, 45\r<br />\r<br />Removes from Bandit Boss leveled leveled lists\r<br />\r<br />Armor:\r<br />All Helmets\r<br />All Shields\r<br />\r<br />v2.5:\r<br />Armor:\r<br />same as v2\r<br />+Adds shields and helmets (glass, ebony, daedric, dragonplate) with same spawn levels as the armor** and same random chance once the player reaches level 52\r<br />\r<br />Weapons:\r<br />same as v2\r<br />\r<br />*when the player character reaches level 52, there is an equal chance that a bandit chief will spawn with either glass, ebony, daedric, or dragonplate armor (to throw in a little variety)\r<br />**The leveld lists for shields already has ebony shields spawning at level 32, I left this as is instead of changing it to level 37 like the rest of the ebony items that wee added (if you don&#39;t like this just ask and I&#39;ll change it)\r<br />\r<br />I chose to add the random chance at level 52, and remove shields and helmets by personal preference. So, if you should want bandit chiefs to spawn with shields and weapons, and or not have the random chance at level 52 and you don&#39;t know how to use the creation kit, I would be happy to oblige and make a change.\r<br />\r<br />If you have [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31264/?]OBIS - Organized Bandits In Skyrim[/url], some Bandit lieutenants also fall under the BanditBoss leveled list and so will also have the upgraded armor and weapons.\r<br />\r<br />I have tested it, although not extensively, If you should encounter a problem of any sort please let me know.",
