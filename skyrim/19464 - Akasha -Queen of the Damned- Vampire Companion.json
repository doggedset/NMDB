  "summary": "This is a tribute to the beautiful late actress and singer Aaliyah Houghton. I am a big fan of her character Akasha from the movie \\\"The Queen of the Damned\\\" and wanted her as a companion in my game. She is available as a Calculated Level 40 or Auto-Level character. I think I came pretty close given the various mods and Vanilla parts I had to use.",
