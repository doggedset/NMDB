  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ff0000][size=6][center]Nexus Exclusive.\r<br />May not be uploaded to ANY external sites.[/center][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=3]ABOUT THIS MOD:[/size][/color][size=3]\r<br />This is a standalone Witcher 3 imported outfit of the bard Dandelion. \r<br />This is just for the outfit, there is no Dandelion NPC at this time.\r<br />Set includes Outfit, Hat, Shoes and Enchanted Rings.\r<br />\r<br />Craft at the forge under leather. Will require linen wraps as well. \r<br />For those who dislike crafting use either the AddItemMenu2 mod, \r<br />or console search under &#34;Dandelion&#34;\r<br />\r<br />[/size][list]\r<br />[*][size=3]Has leather armor stats [/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Upgrade at workbench [/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]All pieces (except ring) are enchantable. [/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Ring comes pre-enchanted for speechcraft.[/size]\r<br />[/list][size=3]\r<br />Male only. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#6d9eeb]*Alternative colours I presented on Tumblr have not been added at this time. I may include them with the next update.*\r<br />[/color]\r<br />Report any bugs in the &#34;Bugs&#34; forum, this way I can easily find your posts and address the issue. Make sure if you are reporting a bug that is not listed as a fix for the v1.1 update coming later on.\r<br />\r<br />If you do not like this mod, then simply do not use it. All negative comments will be ignored, deleted or reported per NEXUS GUIDELINES.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=3]UPDATES COMING WITH V1.1[/size][/color][size=3]\r<br />A proper weightslider. I apparently deleted my weightslider at some point. So I have to remake it. I didn&#39;t realize until performing a final test on the mod today that the wrong slider was in place. This only affects a small area of the neck right now for weights closer to and set at 100. For the most part it is not noticeable because the outfit covers the full body. Weightslider will be included with next update.\r<br />\r<br />Dandelion&#39;s feather for his cap did not export from the Witcher game. Most likely it had some physics. I will be making a feather for his cap to include with the next update.\r<br />\r<br />Original textures for the rings are not as well developed as the outfit itself. I plan to work on those portions of the texture to make the ring closer to 2K resolution with better details. \r<br />\r<br />I will not be making SSE compatible versions of mods until SKSE has made the leap to the new release. Until then I am in no hurry to work with SSE.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]COLOUR VARIANTS WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE IN FUTURE UPDATE:[/color]\r<br />These are not available yet, they have only be featured on Tumblr as part of the WIP updates last month. They are to be included hopefully with v1.1. I&#39;m still deciding which cubemaps I want to use and tweaking some small final details. The eventual goal is to make them part of my Skyrim clothing overhaul looks. Each Hold getting it&#39;s own colour variant for their male bards. Last one pictured is of course the original Pink and Purple.\r<br />[img width=593,height=261]https://68.media.tumblr.com/bfe743fc0702cab04f0305f194875f7d/tumblr_oed11ftwiM1v1phuro1_1280.jpg[/img][img width=595,height=262]https://68.media.tumblr.com/bba85415d830026babc7d175a31f8c44/tumblr_oed11ftwiM1v1phuro2_1280.jpg[/img]\r<br />[img width=602,height=358]https://68.media.tumblr.com/f21425f4fe5615567f88838052f2aab6/tumblr_oed11ftwiM1v1phuro3_1280.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]MODS USED IN SCREENSHOTS[/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41482/?]Rudy ENB[/url] by rudy102\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73326/?]A Lute from Witcher 3[/url] by PandoraTremere\r<br />NPC used in Winking Skeever screenshots is Daenlyn Oakhollow from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8429/?]Interesting NPCs[/url] by Kris Takahashi\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#ffff00][size=5]ENB USERS:[/size][/color]\r<br />All my mods use cubemaps and speculars.\r<br />Not all ENBs treat cubemaps and speculars the same.\r<br />If your textures on this mod look washed out, overly sheen or very glassy ------&gt; it&#39;s your ENB.\r<br />Consult your ENB&#39;s mod page for a fix or information.\r<br />This mod was tested with vanilla lighting and additionally with Rudy ENB. I personally use Rudy ENB in my game. \r<br />Rudy ENB handles cubemaps and speculars very nicely, presenting the final look as it would appear during the creation process.[/center]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[center][color=#6d9eeb][size=5]INSTALL:[/size][/color]\r<br />[size=3]NMM, MO, or manual.
