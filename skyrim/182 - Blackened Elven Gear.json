  "summary": "Changes the Elven armour and weapons to a pleasing, textured black.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod changes all Elven weapons and armour to a nice textured black. I made this on a request, but it turned out looking pretty badarse, so I\\'m using it myself now. This also affects NPCs.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use only the weapons or only the armour, then delete the corresponding folder inside the \\'textures\\' folder. \r\n\r\nIf you are using one of the fine mods that improve the textures on armour and clothes, you will have to overwrite those to use these (though it will only effect the Elven gear). \r\n\r\nIf you want other colours, such as a schnazzy purple, give us a hoi and I\\'ll see what I can do (I might be a little late, because it\\'s rather hard to tear myself away from Skyrim).\r\n\r\nAlso, there are no screenshots for most of the weapons because my character doesn\\'t have them yet. I don\\'t want to look up cheats because I\\'ll be tempted to, you know, cheat. So that means I haven\\'t seen them. But I used exactly the same method for everything, so it should be fine. If it\\'s not, give me a hoi. \r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\n - Installation Instructions - \r\nExtract the \\'textures\\' folder from the archive using WinRAR or 7Zip, and place it in your Skyrim\\\\Data folder. Overwrite if prompted. \r\n\r\n - Incompatibilities - \r\nAnything that changes the Elven armour or weapons. \r\n\r\n - Tools - \r\nFallout Mod Manager to extract the textures from the BSA.\r\nGIMP + plus DDS plugin to modify the DDS. \r\nWinRAR to create the archive.
