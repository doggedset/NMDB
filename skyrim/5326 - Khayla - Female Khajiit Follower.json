  "descriptionHtml": "MADE WITH FORETRENTY\\'S AWESOME SKYRIM NPC EDITOR\r\n\r\nDescription: \r\nMakes Khayla (Khajiit caravan guard) a possible follower and spouse. \r\n\r\nWARNING: In order to make a female khajiit a possible follower, I had to give her a human voice. I did this for my own use, and I\\'m happy with it. If you don\\'t want your khajiit sound like a human, don\\'t download it. \r\n\r\nI made her a Ranger and gave her a set of scaled armor.\r\nStandard version:\r\nShe wears a hunter outfit as standard, so you still can give her any armor you like.\r\nNude version:\r\nKhayla wearing no standard outfit, so you can give her any clothing you like. Or none at all.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Added some batchfiles to the file section. One, to remove the hunting bow, when she ignores the better bows you gave her. And two to set her level to 20 and 30. (she won\\'t auto-level higher than level 10). \r\nYou can use those batchfiles with any follower you want.\r\n\r\nIf you want to change anything, feel free. All you need is this:\r\nhttp://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4554\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\nCopy CAT.bat and khayla.esp OR khayla_nude.esp in your data-folder\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\nDelete khayla.esp\r\n\r\nIngame:\r\nOpen console (~) and type \\\"bat cat\\\" (without quotes)\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\nSome people (including me) ran into problems, when editing Khayla\\'s appearance with the NPC Editor. The head mesh seems to crash the game. So if you edit Khayla, you might wanna go with her vanilla appearance and just copy the ESP file into you Skyrim folder.\r\n\r\nWhen starting the battles for Whiterun, Windhelm and Solitude she simply dissappears, and will show up home again. I think that\\'s because she is member of the caravan factions. And those get removed, when the battles start. Best send her home before starting the battles.",
