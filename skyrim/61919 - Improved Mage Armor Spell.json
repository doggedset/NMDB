  "summary": "Adds 25% duration to all Mage armor spells. Adds +20 Armor rating to each spell level (scales with Mage armor perk) and changes Dragonhide to add 150 Armor rating over a longer duration instead of the 80% reduction.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u][size=5]QUICK OVERVIEW\r<br />[/size][/u][/b][size=3][b]\r<br />1)[/b] All armor spells has +20 Armor rating. This makes lower level armor spells slightly more reasonable to use. For example, Oakflesh now gives 60 Armor rating ~7,2% reduction compared to 40 Armor rating ~4.8% (without mage armor). Ebony Flesh provides 120 Armor rating ~14,4% reduction and 360 Armor rating with all Mage armor perks for ~43,2 reduction. [size=3]Remember that the true armor cap in Skyrim is achieved by 667 Armor rating, since wearing any armor at all grants you a hidden +100 bonus, it&#39;s often stated that it&#39;s 567. But that&#39;s not the case if you wear a robe, so while this mod may seem to buff the armor spells, it still can&#39;t match a real armor and it feels almost ridiculous to cast a spell to gain 40 Armor rating. In comparison wearing a crappy fur armor set gives you 144 armor rating (with 0 skill in light armor) - more than Ebony flesh without any perks.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b]2)[/b] All armor spells have their duration increased by 25% (optional). With Dual casting and Stability perk this translates to 66 more seconds of mage armor if you use vanilla Dual casting settings. If you download the Improved Magic Settings mod (see below) any Dual casted armor with the Stability perk will have a 5 minute duration (3.75 minutes with the optional Lite file).\r<br />\r<br />[b]3)[/b] Dragonhide has been changed to be the next tier armor to make Mage armor perk useful. It now adds 150 Armor rating and functions as a dualcasted next tier Mage armor Spell with 200 seconds duration. With all perks this equals 450 Armor rating ~54% reduction.\r<br />\r<br />4) Mana cost for Mage armor spells has been adjusted slightly to be more linear, Okaflesh costs 100(-3), Stoneflesh 180(-14), Ironflesh 260(-6), Ebonyflesh 340(-1) and Dragonhide 1000(+163). Very small changes, but the jump from Oakflesh to Stoneflesh used to be bigger, and the jump to Ironflesh smaller - which made stoneflesh very hard to use when you got it. 1000 Mana for Dragonhide sounds a lot, but since it acts like a dualcasted spell you do not need to recast it very often. With 100 Alteration and the Master perk 1000 Mana equals less than 300 in game and the duration with Stability perk is 5 minutes (or 3.75 with the optional file).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=5]RECOMMENDED TO USE WITH\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/u][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61921/?]Improved Magic Settings[/url][/b] - Changes Dualcasting cost from 2.8 to 2.5 and effectiveness from 2.2 to 2.5. Basically a must to make dual casting Alteration, restoration, destruction etc worth picking by itself. This mod also changes Combat magicka regeneration to 50% instead of 33%, so that you can rely slightly more on Magicka regen instead of -100% cost enchantments. Max resistances reduced to 70% (down from 85%) so that enemy spells are not trivialized with 97% (0.15*0.15) damage reduction.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61927/?][size=3][b]Improved Mage Light (Candlelight and Magelight)[/b][/size] [/url][size=3]- Reduces the magnitude (brightness) of Candlelight and Magelight with 50 % to avoid the blinding effect, but doubles the radius. Vanilla settings are too bright when looking at a short distance, and you can&#39;t see far at all because of the low radius. Also increases the duration of Candlelight with 25 %. Does not modify the cost or color of the spells at all. Allows you to see clearly at any time or place in Skyrim - without getting a headache.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30073/?][b]Immersive Potions[/b][/url] - Modifies all instant restoration potions to heal over time and makes them non-stackable. If a new potion with the same effect (heal, stamina or magicka restoration) is used, it will overwrite the current potion. There are a couple of mods with the same features, but this one is unique in several aspects. Totally script-free 7kb download.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61922?][b][size=3]Realistic Movement Speed Reduction[/size][/b][/url][size=3] - [/size]This mod aims to bring backwards- and sideways running movement speed closer together and reach more realistic levels. This mod slows the backwards movement speed by roughly 15 % - but the sideways and sidestepping movement speed is reduced by 33 %. It also reduces movement during combat to more realistic levels&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Enjoy&#33;[/b][/size]",
