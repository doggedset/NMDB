This mod replaces and adds to the earlier blue jeans and t-shirts mod.  \r\n\r\nNOTE: Singlets are called many things.  We call them muscle shirts;  But I have heard them called: \\\"Tank tops\\\", \\\"A-shirts\\\", \\\"Vests\\\", \\\"Wife beaters\\\", and just \\\"sleeveless shirts\\\".\r\n\r\nWARNING: This is not an immersion-friendly mod.\r\n\r\nThis mod is not tested on the Khajiit or Argonian character models.  \r\n\r\nThe clothing items are added to the inventory of the Radiant Raiments shop in Solitude.\r\n\r\nThere are no armour ratings or enchantments associated with the items.  \r\n\r\n\r\n============================\r\nCHANGELOG\r\n============================\r\nV. 2.0\r\nAdded singlets of various colours.\r\nRepaired some mesh and vertex errors.\r\nCorrect some bone-weight errors.\r\nAdjusted the alpha and normal maps some.\r\nReduced brightness of shirt colours.\r\n\r\n\r\n============================\r\nINSTALLING/UNINSTALLING\r\n============================\r\n\r\nTo install:\r\nUnpack the .7z file with \\\"7-zip\\\" or a similar programme.\r\n\r\nCopy and paste the contents of the mod\\'s data folder to your \\\"...skyrim/data/\\\" folder.\r\n\r\nOr, alternatively,  a compliant mod manager can be used.\r\n\r\nEnable \\\"bluejeans.esp\\\" in the launcher.\r\n\r\nNOTE: If u have the earlier blue jeans and t-shirts mod installed, installing this mod will overwrite the old files with the corrected ones.
