  "descriptionHtml": "[color=orange][center][size=+3][b][u]The Artificers Mod: Rise[/u][/b][/size][/center][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange][u]Description:[/u] This is my first mod. Remember when you spoke to Paarthurnax and he mentioned the end of the current world could be the beginning of a new one? Whatever the actual wording was, this mod addresses what would be in the next world. Of the two factions included in this mod, the Artificers came to Skyrim when they saw the dragonborn defeating the dragons and stopping the End Times. The problem is that the world the Artificers live in is the world that would form as a result of the End Times. Unable to stop the dragonborn from where they are, they begin to use an Elder Scroll to escape before their world vanishes. A tear occurs and some of them are flung back to Skyrim during the time of the dragonborn\\'s quest.\r\n\r\nUnknown to them, their enemies, known as the Apoclyptics, are also brought back to Skyrim through the tear. This faction is trying to destroy the Artificers so that they could reclaim control over their world. Tensions continue to mount between the two factions, now in a new environment with new challenges.\r\n\r\nThis mod provides the player with more locations to explore, new enemies to fight, and new allies to fight along side with. As the mod is updated, the lore will progress. The future addition of quests, weapons, and armor will allow the player to become more immersed in the mod and create a unique experience.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Requirements:[/u][/b]\r\n-Heavy Armory - New Weapons mod by PrivateEye\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21120] http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21120 [/url]\r\n-Extended Vanilla Weapons mod by Lrsamways\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19611] http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19611 [/url]\r\n\r\n[b][u]Installation:[/u][/b]\r\n1.
