  "descriptionHtml": "THE FALSE ONE RISES, begins with an invitation to accompany a famous traveller on a grand adventure... Before long you are slumming it with the scum of Skyrim. Squeezing out information by whatever means necessary as the body count rises. You\\'ll be facing other adventurers and you may want to take a friend or two with you.\r\n\r\nThis quest doesn\\'t hold your hand. It requires just a little bit of reading clues. You will be making conversation choices that reflect your style of character. You will be travelling to different locations.  It is fully voiced.\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting story, some nice loot, a new follower (optional), some marriageable characters, violent enemies and an exciting final battle.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v212/ElectraNemora/akan.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThis mod requires no other mods to play. It is unlikely to cause conflicts. It adds new characters and situations, not locations. \r\n\r\nTo install simply unzip the file and drop the Data file into your Skyrim directory.  Say yes to merging files.  Uninstallation instructions in the Readme.\r\n\r\nIt starts as soon as you log in. Let me know if you beat it.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nErebus\r\n\r\nVERSION 3: Improved speed and volume of voice acting and added some scripts to kick-off fights.\r\n\r\n",
