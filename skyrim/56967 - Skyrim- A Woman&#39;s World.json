  "descriptionHtml": "***NOTICE***-\r<br />\r<br />A note for those asking me to upload this to SSE Nexus- I tried using the mod on SSE and for the most part it works, except there is not Fuz-Ro-D&#39;oh silent voice type mode available yet, and until such a mod is available that means certain conversations from NPCs won&#39;t work properly. Until a silent voice mod is released for SSE I probably won&#39;t update A Woman&#39;s World.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This mod takes what was started with the World of Women mod (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47303/?) and completely redoes it. In the original mod most of the unique NPC&#39;s were replaced with women, but the faces weren&#39;t modified any further and all of the NPC&#39;s retained their male voices, which is really strange looking when you play it in game. If you switch an NPC&#39;s gender from male to female in the CK, you end up with a really fugly looking woman if you don&#39;t adjust each face individually.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve gone in and modified each NPC further, giving the women more attractive faces and standard female voices. This mod contains 1758 new FaceGen files&#33; (If you&#39;re looking for anime characters, this isn&#39;t the mod for you.) I&#39;ve also changed many more NPC&#39;s than the original mod did, including many of the NPC&#39;s from Dawnguard. Not EVERY NPC has been changed yet, and some of them I&#39;m not going to change at all, like Tullius, Miraak, and Esbern. I still haven&#39;t fixed all of the various bandits, forsworn, and mages, so you&#39;ll still see some men there, and a few women with men&#39;s voices (parts of the World of Woman mod I haven&#39;t fixed yet) \r<br />\r<br />***ISSUES/REQUIREMENTS-***\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m not working on this mod any longer, but other people are welcome to pick up on it if they so choose. I have converted the majority of NPCs, but there are still some groups of NPCs such as the Thalmor and Vampires that I haven&#39;t changed. I also have not gotten around to doing most Dragonborn NPCs.\r<br />\r<br />The World of Women mod didn&#39;t change the voices because some quests/scripts require specific dialogue to activate, and if you change the NPC&#39;s voice it can mess this up sometimes. I have found that if you have installed the silent voice mod (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14884/?) this fixes a lot of problems, though you still need to make some adjustments for it in-game.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />***This mod only changes the genders of NPCs- it is not a body/texture replacer mod*** \r<br />\r<br />I did not change the genders of all of the guards in the CK, because there&#39;s a bajillion of them, so if you want all female guards I recommend downloading a female guard replacer mod. \r<br />\r<br />Please let me know if there are any problems with the way NPCs look, and if there&#39;s a quest where the voice change to an NPC makes it impossible to complete.\r<br />\r<br />REQUIRED MODS-\r<br />Dawnguard and Dragonborn\r<br />Fuz Ro D&#39;oh silent voice mod- http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14884/?\r<br />Apachii Hair mod- http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />CREDIT- \r<br />Credit goes to soundstream1969 for the base of the mod.",
