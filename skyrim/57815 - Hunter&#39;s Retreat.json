It is located about half way between Whiterun and Falkreath\r<br /> as the crow flys and accross the river from the guardian stones. On the outside it looks \r<br />like just another hunter camp but underneath it lies much\r<br />more. The hunter camp features 2 followers, a merchant, crafting amenities,\r<br />Blood Steed, and a tent owned by the player. Underneath the camp is the\r<br />Hunter’s Retreat. It is a modest interior home with plenty of armor and weapon\r<br />storage as well as most crafting amenities. You will also find Lokeel and\r<br />Ragnamar. Find the secret room to find your first set of Midnight Assassin\r<br />Armor and weapons with a large quantity of both kinds of arrows. The room also\r<br />features a mannequin and two armor cases that will show off your Nightingale\r<br />rewards nicely. The master bedroom upstairs also has a set of Hunter’s Armor.\r<br />You will also find a trapdoor downstairs that leads to an underground cavern\r<br />known as the Midnight Sanctuary, home of the Midnight Assassins. Here you will\r<br />find Catamar, Kale, Taj’im, and Lif. This was designed to be a home for\r<br />vampires and offers a pond of blood and plenty of shelter from the daylight.\r<br />Within this Sanctuary you will find plenty of armor and weapons in case you\r<br />lose or sell any. At the end of the cave past the trapdoor there is another\r<br />trapdoor leading straight out to Skyrim for a quick escape. This entire mod was\r<br />designed for someone, vampire and mortal alike, who loathes werewolves and\r<br />thinks they should be hunted to the ends of the earth. I hope you all enjoy\r<br />this mod and I will probably continue to update it if there are any bugs or\r<br />improvements that need to be made. Both merchants should buy stolen goods as\r<br />well.",
