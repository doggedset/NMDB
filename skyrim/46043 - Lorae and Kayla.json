  "descriptionHtml": "First of all, my CK has been kind of buggy so if you have any issues with this mod, please let me know.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i39.tinypic.com/30wqt7c.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nLorae and Kayla are sisters, sort of. Lorae's father was a wizard that experimented with very dark magic. When Lorae turned 12 her father attempted to turn her into a new kind of undead, the experiment did not end well. Her body strongly rejected the intense amount of dark energy, instead of the energy being absorbed into Lorae, it created a separate being. The reaction killed Lorae's father. Kayla, being a physical manifestation of demonic power has a special connection with the dead and therefore is a powerful necromancer. Both of them have studied at the College of Winterhold since the incident. Lorae picked up conjuration very easily and is almost as good at conjuring as Kayla is at raising dead. They can be found in the Hall of Attainment at the College of Winterhold. They're usually on the 2nd floor.\r\n\r\n[b]This requires Apachii Skyhair.[/b]\r\n\r\nThe armor is skimpy due to a replacer.\r\n\r\nLorae uses lightning spells and she usually conjures a Flame Atronach or two (both of them have the Twin Souls perk, so don't use these followers if you don't like a small army following you.)\r\nKayla uses frost/ice spells. Lorae likes 2h weapons, Kayla likes 1h weapons (both of them can dual-weild) If, when using them, you find them using other spells than the ones in my images please take pictures and post them!\r\n\r\n[b]Update:[/b]\r\nPeople were complaining of CTD's. The newest update fixes that as well as gives them weapons and a default armor. I gave them weapons and armor because they hardly ever used the bound weapons and whenever I dismissed them, they got naked. In the first version, however, they don't have weapons or default armor.\r\nREMEMBER TO UNINSTALL THE PREVIOUS VERSION BEFORE INSTALLING THE UPDATE.\r\n\r\nAlso check out my [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36554/]sexy male followers[/url], [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37015/]The Vanderwall Twins[/url], and my [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/46278/]two shouting followers[/url].\r\n\r\nCredit goes to Bethesda and Apachii.",
