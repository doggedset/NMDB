  "descriptionHtml": "English Translation\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nNow you can choose between an English and a German Version. Both are listes under Update files, since they\\'re both the actual 1.3 files with the working world models as already mentioned before^^\r\n\r\n\r\n(V1.3) Alternate HD textures and working inventory models!\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nFinally with the release of the Creation Kit, it was possible to make working gnd files, so now the right model with fitting texture is shown in your inventory or in the world.\r\n\r\nAlso, with the new HD textures from Bethesda it was possible to make HD textures for this mod.\r\nBUT: Because I had no HD texture of the Scalemail, I made a new one, made from Metal, so it will change the look of the armor a little. If you liked the older more, you can keep it, maybe I will make a HD version of it.    ---> look pictures for changes\r\n\r\nThe new ESP with world models and the new textures are different WinRar Archives so you can download both or just one of them.\r\n\r\nV1.2\r\n--------\r\n\r\nNow with this new version, you get the entire set working with female characters! As seen in the pictures, Lydia is very satisfied with the result!\r\nOf course, both genders can be used with beast races. Also with 1.2, there comes an alternative hood, made from chainmail, as also can be seen in the picture.\r\n\r\nSo now you have the complete set working with both genders, so you can enjoy, and you can choose between 3 different types of head gear, or you can\r\nignore it, whatever ;)\r\n\r\nStill, I have no working gnd models, so this will be my task for next version!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\nV1.1\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\\\"I agree with the others, add a hood and its all good\\\"\r\n\r\n\\\"maybe a hood would be cool\\\"\r\n\r\n\\\"I think a hood would be a nice option, but I don\\'t mind the helm. \\\"\r\n\r\nSo with this new version, you get, what you demanded: A hood made from the same dark stuff as some parts of the cuirass.\r\nIt\\'s compatible with the beast races.\r\nAnd for the ones, who appreciated the helmet, it was made fully compatible with the beast races, too.\r\nIf some of this doesn\\'t work, feel free to comment, as already stated before.\r\nThe hood is called \\\"Hartherz - Kapuze\\\"\r\n\r\nStill, there is no female version or working Inventory models, but I will work on it!\r\n\r\nEnjoy ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nV1.0\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSo, this is my first mod for an Elder Scrolls mod, I\\'m enough satisfied with to upload it.\r\n\r\nIt adds a Standalone light armor set to the game, which is called \\\"Hartherz Armor\\\". Hartherz is a German word, referring to the name of my character. \r\nThe Items have german names, since I\\'m from Germany, but this shouldn\\'t be a problem. The set contains the \\\"Hartherz Kampfgewand\\\" (Hartherz Battle dress), the \\\"Hartherz Stiefel\\\" (boots), the \\\"Hartherz Handschuhe\\\" (gauntlets) and the \\\"Hartherz Helm\\\" (helmet).\r\nThe battle dress is a retexture of the mageapprentice robe, the helm is a retextured hide helmet. The boots were iron before and the gauntlets were not even retextured, they look like those from Ulfric Stormcloak.\r\nSince these are different parts you can combine them with other armor sets, if you want.\r\nThey can be forged under the category leather and can be also tempered on an armor table.\r\nThe stats are somewhere between iron and leather and it\\'s classified as light armor.\r\n\r\nSince it\\'s my first uploaded mod, there may be some issues I didn\\'t notice, so you have to tell me ;)\r\n\r\nFor installation, simply put the files from the \\\"Hartherz armor\\\" folder into your Skyrim\\\\Data directory.\r\n\r\nIf you like this mod, comment on it, endorse it, or do whatever you want to do else to express your joy",
