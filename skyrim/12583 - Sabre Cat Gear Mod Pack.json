That idea brought the image of the Sabre cat\\'s teeth to mind, and then evolved to the idea of using the actual sabre cat\\'s head like a hunter\\'s trophy hat or helmet. \r\nThis mod(dest) request quickly materialized into 3 model candidates for the imagined part, but all versions were so cool that they simply had to be included together:\r\n\r\n1. the Mane - modelled by OG-Jay and rigged+imported by LordOfWar - the largest model of the 3 variations, features a large mane-like hoodie going down on the shoulders, has straight/upwards ears and no lower-jaw.\r\n2. the Predator - modeled, rigged and imported by LordOfWar - is the lighter version, but just as killer - and it features a thinner/shorter mane, as it doesn\\'t cover the shoulders entirely, but the special thing about it is that its\\' ears are drawn back, as if in full attack mode. Also no lower-jaw.\r\n3. the Hunter - modelled, rigged and imported by Targaryen - is tightly-fit around the neck, has straight up-wards ears, and features an awesome lower-jaw to it, to give off a full ninja mask/helmet vibe that most of you will like.\r\n\r\nIn our opinion they are all unique and amazing in their own way, and we urge you to try each one before deciding what your favorite is.\r\nAll helmets were custom fitted for each race (including Orc, Khajiit and Argonian) and gender (whichever you prefer to play with).\r\n\r\n_________________\r\n_________________\r\n\r\nThis mod pack also includes shields. There are 2 Shield versions:\r\n\r\n1. Sabrecat Shield - Light version, based on the Windhelm guard\\'s shield model, but instead of the painted emblem, there\\'s now an encrusted metal sabre cat head emblem bolted on the shield\\'s surface. This is due to a new model made by OG-Jay and textured by both him and DVAted.\r\n2. Sabrecat Targe - Heavy version, inspired by the Targe of the Blooded shield model; it features spikes around the metal sabre cat head emblem, which are functional because they may cause a bleeding effect when power-bashing is used against any opponents. This is the only item that cannot be enchanted with an enchantment of your choice, but it can be upgraded at the workbench just like all the others.\r\n\r\n_________________\r\n_________________\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod pack also includes a sword model.\r\nFroda created a \\\"dragonblade\\\" sword using the head of the dragon priest staff for the handle and for the blade it took the model from the unique two-handed weapon \\\"ebony blade\\\". Based on his mod (which is compatible with this one and can be found and downloaded here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7462 ) DVAted has conceived an idea for a specific sabre-themed sword - the Sabre Saber - and with the help of his friend OG-Jay, they\\'ve brought it to you. They\\'ve modified the dragon\\'s head (the butt of the handle) into a sabre cat\\'s head, complete with two awesome sabre-teeth. Afterwards, a scratch-modelled and textured hand-guard was added to the handle, and then, to make the blade special, they\\'ve widened it and sculpted the \\\"blunt\\\" side with a saw-teeth edge. \r\nWe thank Froda for permission to release our sword in this pack, and we hope you will enjoy it in your slashing adventures.\r\n_________________\r\n_________________\r\n\r\nAs of version 2.2 this mod pack also includes two BOW models and new arrows. There is a short bow and a long bow model. Both were rigged by tumbajamba from TreasureChest/OG-Jay\\'s and DVAted\\'s sabre cat head sword handle. The arrows are suppose to mimic sabre-teeth at the tip. They are all craftable in the Draugr forge section.\r\n\r\n_________________\r\n_________________\r\n\r\nThe main armor cuirass of this mod is a modified Stormcloak\\'s Officer outfit - asc_kel (who has previously released similar Wolf Armor and Imperial light Armor mod packs) has shortened the skirt and added pants to the male version in his already trademarked style. He has given this model to DVAted with exclusive permission for this very mod pack. \r\nThe heavy female version, as well as the heavy boots and gauntlets for both sexes remain unchanged from the stormcloak officer versions, aside for the textures. The light versions are stripped of all the claws and teeth that decorated them.\r\n\r\nEvery armor piece (cuirass, boots, gauntlets and helmets) has 2 versions:\r\n- Heavy (with teeth and claws, high stats but weighing more) \r\nand \r\n- Light (or \\\"lite\\\", without claws and teeth on the models; also lower stats but less weight)\r\n\r\nEach of them come in 3 colors: \r\n- brown (or orange as the vanilla sabre cat\\'s fur)\r\n[IMG]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/12583-2-1331399501.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n- puma (a black variation for the friends of the shadows)\r\n[IMG]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/12583-3-1331399502.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n- snow (as the vanilla snow sabre cat\\'s white fur) \r\n[IMG]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/12583-4-1331399502.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[b]All textures were composed and optimized by DVAted.[/b]\r\n\r\nAll armor and weapons can be crafted at the blacksmith forge and improved at their respective stations (workbench or grinding wheel).\r\nThe masks can be found in the Hide category, while the armors can be found in the \\\"Studded\\\" category, and the shields and sword in the Iron section of the forge.\r\n\r\nNormal armor versions require normal sabre cat pelts, Snow versions require snow-sabre cat pelts, while Puma versions require a normal armor piece and charcoal sticks to color them.\r\n\r\nOther crafting ingredients would be Sabre Cat Tooth, Sabre Cat Eye (for the helmets), dragon bone and dragon scales (for the weapons), leather strips, leather, iron, corundum, quicksilver and ebony ingots. You can find better specific lists ingame in the forge menu.\r\n\r\nBE WARNED: You will have to hunt for a lot of sabre cats to get the ingredients needed for these armors - but by then you\\'ll feel to have earned it :D\r\n\r\nThe stats of the armors and weapons are balanced and lore-friendly. The exact base values can be found ingame for each of them, but we assure you they are not weaker than iron gear, and yet not stronger than daedric gear.\r\n\r\nThat\\'s pretty much it!\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy your new vocation as a sabre cat hunter!\r\n\r\n_________________\r\n_________________\r\n\r\nUpdate History:\r\n[b]- NEW! v.2.2 - fixed the purple glow on some helmets, added 2 bows made by TumbaJamba and matching arrows, moved all weapons to \\\"Draugr\\\" forge section and the shields to \\\"Studded\\\".
