  "descriptionHtml": "The Khajiit\\'s looked a little dull to me. I used some real fur textures from my cat Ozzie and from various other cats, blended them with the original and sharpened it a little.\r\n\r\nThe textures are scaled at 4096x4096. They have HD normals to go with them. Lots of normal map edits have been blurred to decrease blocki-ness. But with the Khajiits it looks really nice sharpened and gives off a fuzzier look to the fur.\r\n\r\nIf you do not like the new normals just delete all of the files with \\\"_msn\\\" in the name.\r\n\r\nI\\'m probably not going to change these as they were pretty much for myself, but I figured that someone out there may like them.\r\n\r\nI will most likely continue to update these and perhaps put a little more work into them, I\\'ll probably move onto the Argonians after.\r\n\r\nCredits to Reptiley for the base textures [url=Khajiit Fur]http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=996&navtag=file/images.php?id=996&tab=3[/url]",
