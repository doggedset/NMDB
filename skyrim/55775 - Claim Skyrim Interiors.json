  "descriptionHtml": "This mod was mostly made for personal use and to aid roleplay. \r<br />It adds a spell to the game called Claim Interior that when cast inside an interior cell will make the caster the new owner of the cell. \r<br />\r<br />Right now I have not added in a spell tome for it and so in order to get and use the spell you must do the following:\r<br />\r<br />- Open the console and type &#34;help claim&#34;  to get the ID of the Claim Interior spell.\r<br />- Type into the console &#34;player.addspell xxxxxxx&#34; with &#34;xxxxxxx&#34; replaced by the ID given from the help command.\r<br />\r<br />After that the spell should be added to your spell book under Alteration. Since I made this spell mostly as a means of roleplaying moving into a fort, dungeon, or house that I like there is no mana cost for the spell. \r<br />\r<br />Known Bugs: \r<br />- In testing I would sometimes have an odd chest left in a house that wouldn&#39;t become claimed after casting. Not sure what causes it but I just manually fixed it with the console by selecting the object and using &#34;setownership&#34;. \r<br />\r<br />This mod has not been thoroughly tested so you should use at your own risk. I&#39;m not 100% at this point whether or not some cells will reset after casting, but I don&#39;t believe so. You might be best to store really valuable gear in somewhere that you KNOW to be safe.",
