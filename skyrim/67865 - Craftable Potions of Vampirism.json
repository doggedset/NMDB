  "descriptionHtml": "A very simple mod that adds craftable potions that turns the player character into a vampire. Similar to Master Vampires Blood by Zimm8662 (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8918/?). This mod adds a crafting recipe to the cook pot under misc. The recipe includes a potion of blood and vampire dust (which can be of varying difficulty depending on what mods one has).\r<br />\r<br />Installation: None. Drop the esp into the data folder, or use the mod manager.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation: None. This mod does not use any scripts, so it [u]should[/u] be fine.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility: None that I can see. This mod does not edit vanilla forms. Any issues one might run into would probably be a load order issue.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements: Dawnguard. Seriously this one should go without saying.\r<br />\r<br />F.A.Q.: This is my first mod so I don&#39;t know what kinds of questions people ask, so I don&#39;t know... just ask questions in the posts section I guess, and I might answer them.",
