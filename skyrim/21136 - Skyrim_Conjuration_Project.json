more unique creatures and characters.\r\nI will also make the Thalmor summon more creatures like \r\nmagic anomalies; whisp mothers; ice Wraiths, etc..\r\n\r\nPS: One thing that i would like to ask all of you that have\r\ndownloaded the previous version or are going to download\r\nthe new version is to comment about the mod; because i really\r\nlike when i get feedback i order get your impression about\r\n the mod; but never the less thanks for reading and if you\r\nreally liked the mod don\\'t forget to endorse.\r\n\r\n\r\nSkyrim_Conjuration_Project_Mod Version 1.0\r\n\r\nThis Mod adds to Skyrim 40 creatures for you to summon as\r\nwell as Craftable Scrolls, Spell Tomes and Magic Staves;\r\nit also allows you to summon more creatures as you level up\r\n in your conjuration Perk Tree.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION:\r\n\r\nThe Skyrim Conjuration Project is a mod that aims to make\r\nthe conjuration player have a better experience when\r\nplaying Skyrim as a Conjurer; it gives the player more \r\ncreatures to summon; more craftable scrolls, Spell tomes\r\nand Magic Staves and also allows you to summon more \r\ncreatures as your progress in the conjuration Perk Tree.\r\nThe new Scrolls, Spell tomes and Magic Staves will also\r\nbe in vendor Stores in Loot and in chests.\r\nConjurers will also summon new creatures instead of \r\nsummoning the traditional familiar or flame or frost\r\nAtronach.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEATURES OF THE MOD:\r\n\r\nThe Creatures you will be able to Summon; Craft Spell Tomes\r\n; Scrolls or Magic Staves are:\r\n\r\nBEAR\r\nCAVE BEAR\r\nCHAURUS\r\nCHAURUS REAPER\r\nDRAGON PRIEST\r\nDRAUGR DEATH OVERLORD\r\nDREMORA LORD\r\nDWARVEN CENTURION\r\nDWARVEN SPHERE\r\nDWARVEN SPIDER\r\nFALMER SHAMAN\r\nFALMER SPELLSWORD BOSS\r\nFAMILIAR\r\nFIRE DRAGON\r\nFLAME ATRONACH\r\nFORSWORN BRIHEART MAGIC\r\nFORSWORN BRIHEART MELEE\r\nFROST ATRONACH\r\nFROST DRAGON\r\nFROST TROLL\r\nFROSTBITE SPIDER\r\nFROSTBITE SPIDER LARGE \r\nFROSTBITE SPIDER GIANT\r\nGIANT MUDCRAB\r\nGIANT\r\nHAGRAVEN\r\nICE WOLF\r\nICE WRAITH\r\nMAGIC ANOMALY\r\nMALKORAN\\'S SHADE\r\nSABRE CAT\r\nSKEEVER\r\nSKELETON MAGE\r\nSKELETON NECRO IMPERIAL\r\nSKELETON NECRO MELEE\r\nSKELETON NECRO STORMCLOAK\r\nSNOW BEAR\r\nSNOW FROSTBITE SPIDER\r\nSNOW FROSTBITE SPIDER LARGE\r\nSNOW FROSTBITE SPIDER GIANT\r\nSNOWY SABER CAT\r\nSTORM ATRONACH\r\nTROLL\r\nUNDEAD DRAGON\r\nWISP MOTHER\r\nWOLF\r\n\r\nAll of the scrolls, spell tomes and magic staves are only \r\ncraftable at the Skyforge in whiterun.\r\n\r\nAt the vanilla game you can only summon one creature and as\r\nyou would get stronger you still only could summon one \r\ncreature no matter how strong it was.\r\nBut with the Skyrim_Conjuration_Project Mod you now will\r\nbe able to summon up to a total of five creatures.\r\nAt novice conjuration you will still be able only to summon \r\none creture; but with this mod at the apprentice conjuration\r\n level you will be able to select another perk when you \r\nlevel up the next time and then you will be able to summon \r\n up to two creatures.\r\nAs you progress in your conjuration; the same selectable \r\nperk will be available when you get the adept conjuration perk\r\n and then you will be able to summon up to three creatures;\r\n when you get to the expert level you will be able to \r\n summon four creatures and finally at master level you will\r\nbe able to summon five creatures.\r\nI\\'ve made this because it allows you to summon more creatures\r\nas you get stronger; but still doesn\\'t make super powerfull\r\nand makes the mod more lore friendly.\r\n\r\nFUTURE OF THE MOD:\r\n\r\nIn the future i will try to update the mod every week and\r\nadd more summonable creatures and craftable spell tomes,\r\nscrolls, and magic staves or anyother content related to \r\nconjuration magic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(PS: I suggest that you play with this mod at Master difficulty\r\nif you are an experienced player and also with the mods \r\nWarzones_Civil_Unrest and Deadly_Dragons and anyother mods\r\nthat make the game more difficult). \r\n\r\nIf you really enjoyed the mod don\\'t forget to endorse; and \r\nonce again feel free to comment about the mod and give ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLING: Just place the TotalConjuration.esp file in your\r\nskyrim Data Folder and before playing check if the file is\r\nactivated in your skyrim data files menu or in your mod manager.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
