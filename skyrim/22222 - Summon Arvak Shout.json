  "summary": "Simple tweak for Arvaks Summon Spell.",
  "descriptionHtml": "So, who else here pumped all their points into Health and Stamina only to find out that one of the coolest mounts introduced by Bethesda required 133mana to summon? \r\n\r\nHands up.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I have had Arvak for a while now and Im sick of looking at a spell I cant use. So Ive decided to change that.\r\nArvak is now summoned via a shout, no cooldown and he is summoned where your crosshair is within 25ft, much like the original, but with zero mana cost.\r\n\r\nI hope it wont effect how you learn it, I dont think it will since its taught directly to you. Anyone who comes across a problem please let me know, other then that, enjoy!",
