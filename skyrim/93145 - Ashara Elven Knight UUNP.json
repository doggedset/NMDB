  "descriptionHtml": "Hello everyone! This is a long awaited UUNP conversion of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57613]SyndeyB's Ashara Elven Knight[/url]. With her blessing, she has allowed me to publish my conversions to the Nexus community. \n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Required: [/b]\n<br />[/u][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57613]Ashara Elven Knight[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49015]Bodyslide[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68000]XPMSE[/url] (Only for HDT)\n<br />\n<br />For this conversion I added an optional alternative skirt. I original made this for myself to work with some mash-ups, but decided to share it instead. It maybe a bit too skimpy for some because it's lower on the waist line. Take a look at the pictures if it is something that you would like to use. If not, there is always the original skirt.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Food for thought:[/b]\n<br />[b]I hate jiggle metal! It's so unimmersive &gt;:( !\n<br />[/b]No worries! My conversion has a Non HDT version. Select which flavor you want through BodySlides Group Filter.n Look for \"Ashara Elven Knight HDT\" and \"Ashara Elven Knight Non HDT\". Click, build, and enjoy.\n<br />\n<br />[b]I know Elven Knight has a ton of optional clothing. Can I wear them over the chain mail body suits? Or am I going to see clipping?\n<br />[/b]I anticipated that the conversion would be worn over the body suits and other accessorize that are part of the armor options. I accommodated as best to my ability such as letting out certain things, deleting body references, and deleting parts of the body to eliminate as much clipping as I could. There maybe some clipping if your body preset is on the extreme side, and in certain poses. \n<br />\n<br />Thank you everyone for downloading my conversion!\n<br />Best wishes, Neko\n<br />\n<br />[b]Credits:\n<br />[/b]Huge thank you goes out to SyndeyB for allowing to publish my conversions and for creating amazing armor mods.[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49015]Ousnius and Caliente for making BodySlide [/url]﻿\n<br />\n<br />Mods used in screen shots:\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79127]Ophelia Accessories by Krater[/url]﻿\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/81973]CN Accessories by Auburnsred\n<br />[/url]﻿Skyrim Necrosarium Set by Shocky (Google it.)",
