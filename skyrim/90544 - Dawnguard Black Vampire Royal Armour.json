  "descriptionHtml": "first mod/retexture I've ever made, thought I might as well share in case anybody else wants it, it's only currently for Males ( though I guess if there was some kind of demand for a female variant I could probably manage it (hence v0.1 it is very bare minimum as is).\n<br />\n<br />Drop a message if there are any issues, though I havent encountered any during my usage.",
