Sure you have the city shields that have the sigil of the city or area that you are in, but what I wanted to see is the kinds of shields that you&#39;d see a warrior flaunting.\r<br />\r<br />[B][U][SIZE=3]Details[/SIZE][/U][/B]\r<br />The base armour rating of all light shields that are added with this mod is 19, which is slightly better than the guard shields, while not making them over-powered. The base armour rating of the heavy shields is 23. Please be aware that these are the base stats, and obviously things like light/heavy armour proficiency are not taken into account with their base values. Also, as a notice. In the next update for this mod, the armour ratings for all shields will be more varied, making them have their weaknesses and strengths.\r<br />\r<br />[B][U][SIZE=3]Current Shields:[/SIZE][/U][/B]\r<br />[B]Light Shields[/B]\r<br />* Basic Light Shield\r<br />* Black Paint Light Shield\r<br />* Blood Claw Light Shield\r<br />* Stained Light Shield\r<br />* Warpainted Light Shield\r<br />* Spriggan Light Shield\r<br />* Warrior Light Shield\r<br />\r<br />[B]Heavy Shields[/B]\r<br />* Basic Heavy Shield\r<br />* Black Paint Heavy Shield\r<br />* Blood Claw Heavy Shield\r<br />* Stained Heavy Shield\r<br />* Warpainted Heavy Shield\r<br />* Spriggan Heavy Shield\r<br />* Warrior Heavy Shield\r<br />\r<br />[B][U][SIZE=3]Work in Progress Stuff:[/SIZE][/U][/B]\r<br />* Guild and Faction Shields\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   (Coming next update.)\r<br />* Craftable City Shields\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t (This will be an optional extension.)\r<br />* Giving Specific NPCs the New Shields\r<br />* Adding Shields to Leveled and Vendor Lists\r<br />* Adding Tempering Recipes, Allowing You to Improve Them\r<br />* More Shields\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   (Coming every update.)\r<br />\r<br />[LINE]\r<br />\r<br />[B][U][SIZE=3]Comments and Constructive Criticism:[/SIZE][/U][/B]\r<br />If you have any ideas of what you think should happen next with this mod, I&#39;d be happy to read them.
