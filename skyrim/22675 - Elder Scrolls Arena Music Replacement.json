  "summary": "A mod that replaces the music in skyrim with music from Elder Scrolls Arena. Kind of corny, but it\\'s more of a experience mod.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is just a little project I did to get more experience with the CK, it plays some ol\\' skewl Arena music. This also replaces the main theme. This is still in development.\r\n\r\nWanna help with development? If you can give me at least one of the song names in the game that I haven\\'t replaced that should be, be my guest to PM me them. I really appreciate that help and so thank you in advance.",
