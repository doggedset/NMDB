It&#39;s a beautiful location&#33; All I have done here is add an [color=#1e84cc]Alto Winery [/color](with free traveler&#39;s beds), and a [color=#1e84cc]Wizard&#39;s shop[/color], along with a border wall and guard, and some minor details. Fully navmeshed and cleaned with Tes5Edit. \r<br />\r<br />The mill remains rather spartan; No elaborate setup like a blacksmith or general goods trader. The mill seems to be a real border outpost between the Pale and Eastmarch, but there&#39;s enough of an economy for trade between it, Windhelm and Winterhold. \r<br />\r<br />Please let me know how this version plays. Everything is made with vanilla assets, and contains only a single esp. Stay tuned&#33; [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]Requirements:[/color]\r<br />- Skyrim and Update\r<br />- Dawnguard (for a few resources, more to come in a later version)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Incompatibilities:[/color]\r<br />- Any mod that might modify the immediate region of Anga&#39;s Mill[/center]",
