  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Georgia][size=6][center][color=#00ffff][u]~Port Amon~[/u][/color][/center][/size][/font][center]A wintry, cozy town on the Broken Coast.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]I wondered for a long time what happened to the people of Winterhold, after they had &#39;moved on&#39; from the Great Collapse. Where did they go? As a Hold capitol, how can Winterhold maintain any kind of commerce or food supply? My friends, I have made a new town that might solve a few of these mysteries. \r<br />\r<br />In time for the holidays, I present Port Amon; A small inlet with a few houses with Nord and Dunmer inhabitants living peacefully, ruled by a Telvanni alchemist who maintains Azura&#39;s Beacon, the town&#39;s singularly impressive lighthouse. This was an experiment of mine to work with AI Packages, and to see if vanilla locations can be replanted from their original source.\r<br />\r<br />The mod comes with:\r<br />[/size][list]\r<br />[*][size=3]A Blacksmith, Alchemist/Enchanter/Wizard store, and Tavern with a rented room&#33; All unique designs with functional NPCs along with a few other houses.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Port Amon comes with a few guards of its own, a bit better-equipped than the poor Winterhold guards, as well as their own guard tower.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3][url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Whistling_Mine]Whistling Mine[/url] has been moved from the roadside to down by the coast, with easy access to the shipping docks and smithy. [color=#00ffff]Thorgar [/color]actually has a house of his own now that he hangs out in and sleeps after a hard day&#39;s work at the mine&#33;[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]A player home that&#39;s out of the way enough that you don&#39;t feel obligated to use it. Not much to it, but it&#39;s something if you feel like you want to stay in town. I could do more with it later if desired.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Generally a Christmas-themed town with colored lanterns and white stags in town&#33;[/size]\r<br />[/list][size=3]\r<br />[color=#00ffff]Requirements: [/color]\r<br />- Dragonborn and Dawnguard. \r<br />Everything else is from vanilla resources&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Conflicts: [/color]\r<br />- Any mod that changes the exterior of Whistling Mine (as far as the routine of its inhabitants is concerned) or the area just south of Bleak Coast Cave might be an issue. \r<br />Edit: I have TES Legendary Cities active, and it has not been an issue for me. Let me know if it is for you&#33;\r<br />- It also unfortunately conflicts with &#39;Pirates of the North&#39; and &#39;Shumer and the fall of Allagard&#39;.\r<br />[/size][/center]",
