  "descriptionHtml": "#Download my new mod that complements this one: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23781]TGirls of Skyrim - TS Revamped - Alexina and Stella as followers[/url]\r\n\r\n***PRELUDE*** (read if interest you, and sorry my poor english)\r\n\r\n    Since they were born, each those four girls did not knew what would become. Born different from all another girls, with fantastic abilities and aptitude for fighting. But mostly one thing: they were born with a male sexual organ, that was a sign which something will happen. In each city where they were born, there a cult that believed in the coming of the dragons and the \\\"Dragonborn\\\". In the prophecy, a girl born with a male organ would be a servant of the \\\"Dragonborn\\\" who would fight alongside him, protect his life and satisfy all the needs of his master. The girls were born \\\"different\\\" for one reason: as we know, the \\\"Dragonborn\\\" can be a man or a woman, as they were born \\\"different\\\", they can serve him, whatever his sex. They were tattooed with the mark of the dragon because, not coincidentally, they are daughters of members from the cult who believe in the legend of the \\\"Dragonborn\\\", were created as normal girls and years later were sent to find him.\r\n    There was rumors from appearance of dragons in the borders of Skyrim, a sign that had been predicted by the priests of the cult, which would a signal that the \\\"Dragonborn\\\" would be there. The four girls used their abilities to get information and then followed to the frontiers, where three of them met each other. Michelle, Lyla and Amanda were captured by the Imperial Forces who sent them to Helgen for be executed. Luckily, Misha saw the other girls being arrested and hid. She followed the patrol that was taking the girls to Helgem, but before arriving there a dragon flew near of  them, distracting the guards and giving them the opportunity to flee. Misha killed the guards from far with her bow and joined to the another three girls. They passed away from Helgen because were afraid of being caught again, then, they followed to Riverwood and there found they had a common destiny.\r\n\r\n***What\\'s new!***\r\n- Now all the Tgirls have dragon tattoos- They were tattooed because are servants of the Dragonborn.\r\n\r\n- New muscular texture for Lyla- Like the original mod, Lyla uses the \\\"heavy armor perk\\\" already upgraded. so, I\\'ve decided to put another texture making her seem more athletic. Only one reason to justify the difference.\r\n\r\n- New hairy texture for Lyla and Michelle\r\n\r\n- Reduction of certain textures from 4096x4096 to 2048x2048 giving a better performance.\r\n\r\n- Some fixes in the feet.\r\n\r\n-Description-\r\n\r\nThis is an adaptation from original \\\"[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21038]Girs of Skyrim mod - by basskimm[/url] \\\" with  the \\\"[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10420]Transgender body replacement CBBE and UNP by ISC9[/url]\\\". I just replace the original bodies with transsexual bodies from \\\"Transgender body mod\\\", modifying the textures also. So, the real credits goes to basskimm, ISC9 and lion_spirit who uploaded the file from \\\"Transgender body mod\\\"\r\n\r\nThis mod don\\'t need any previous file instalation from the originals mods, is a STANDALONE adapted mod.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\n-You will find them in the \\\"Riverwood Sleeping Giant inn\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\n!!THANKS!! \r\n\r\nThanks to basskimm  and ISC9 who made these wonderful mods.\r\n\r\nIf you want to download the original mod go to: \r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21038]Girs of Skyrim[/url]\r\n\r\nOR \r\n\r\nIf you want to download the original trangender mod go to:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10420]Transgender body replacement CBBE and UNP by ISC9[/url]",
