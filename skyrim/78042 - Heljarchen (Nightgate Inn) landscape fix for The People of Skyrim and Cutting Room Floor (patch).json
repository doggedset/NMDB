  "modName": "Heljarchen (Nightgate Inn) landscape fix for The People of Skyrim and Cutting Room Floor (patch)",
  "summary": "Fixes the landscape around the blacksmith&#39;s shop added in Heljarchen to the Nightgate Inn area by the Cutting Room Floor mod that gets snowed in by The People Of Skyrim. This patch makes that area accessible again.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72449/]The People of Skyrim[/url]Â is an incredible mod that adds so much to the world. In some cases it adds more than we might want, and if you use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47327]Cutting Room Floor[/url] there is a small area by the Nightgate Inn (now called Heljarchen) that has an added blacksmith. Unfortunately, even the CRF Patch for TPOS forwards a change to this area making the blacksmith&#39;s house completely snowed in. This simple patch restores the original landscape/terrain from the Cutting Room Floor so you can access that area.\r<br />\r<br />Install manually or with your preferred mod manager.\r<br />\r<br />Load order:\r<br />...\r<br />Cutting Room Floor.esp\r<br />...\r<br />tpos_ultimate_esm.esp\r<br />tpos_ultimate_cutting_room_floor_patch.esp (optional, actually)\r<br />TPOS_CRF_Nightgate-Fix.esp (this mod)\r<br />\r<br />I haven&#39;t extensively checked the area, and it&#39;s possible that I have thrown some navmeshes out of order. Please report bugs and I&#39;ll see if I can&#39;t figure out exactly what part to restore to the TPOS version. Any bugs are likely pretty inconsequential.\r<br />\r<br />No scripts, just restoration of the original navmesh and landscape. Probably save to add and remove even if you&#39;re in the area.",
