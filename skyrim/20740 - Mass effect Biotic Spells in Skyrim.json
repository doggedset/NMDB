Barrier also allow the use of Nova without loosing all magicka. You can also detonate the barrier to lift enemies near you.\r<br />\r<br />[size=+1.8]Biotic Enchantments[/size]\r<br />Like mass effect, you can improve your weapon with warp, unlike mass effect, you can improve your weapons with other Biotic spells as well. This was requested by Degalon.\r<br />Those enchantments are unlike any other, as they must be casted as an lesser power, and lasts almost forever or until the weapon is sheathed.\r<br />\r<br />[color=Dodgerblue]Warp Weapon[/color]: Enhance your weapon by adding Warp effect. cost 100 and last until the weapon is sheathed. Lesser power.\r<br />\r<br />[color=Dodgerblue]Throw Weapon[/color]: Enhance your weapon with kinect energy, throwing any foe away\r<br />\r<br />[color=Dodgerblue]Lift Weapon[/color]: Your weapon has a chance of lifting enemies.\r<br />\r<br />[color=Dodgerblue]Slam Weapon[/color]: Enhance your weapon, making it have a chance of slam the foe to the ground\r<br />\r<br />[color=Dodgerblue]Stasis Weapon[/color]: Your weapon has a chance of put the foe in Stasis.\r<br />\r<br />[color=Dodgerblue]Shockwave Weapon[/color]: shock waves passes through the foe body when in contact with the weapon.(perhaps i make the weapon throw an shock wave.)\r<br />\r<br />[size=+1.8]Biotic Combos or Biotic Explosions[/size]\r<br />By combining Biotic spells effects you can Deal Biotic Explosions, the actual combinations are:\r<br />Singularity + Warp\r<br />singularity + throw\r<br />Singularity + Biotic Charge\r<br />Singularity + ShockWave\r<br />Singularity + Nova\r<br />Singularity + Reave\r<br />Warp + singularity\r<br />Warp + throw\r<br />Warp + Biotic Charge\r<br />Warp + Shockwave\r<br />Warp + Nova\r<br />Warp + Reave\r<br />Warp + Slam\r<br />Stasis + singularity\r<br />Stasis + throw\r<br />Stasis + Biotic Charge\r<br />Stasis + Shockwave\r<br />Stasis + Nova\r<br />Stasis + Reave\r<br />Lift + Throw (no explosion here, but the effect is multiplied in this combination)\r<br />Lift + Warp\r<br />Lift + ShockWave\r<br />Lift + Nova\r<br />Lift + Biotic Charge\r<br />Lift + Reave\r<br />Slam + Warp\r<br />Slam + Throw\r<br />Slam + Reave\r<br />Slam + ShockWave\r<br />\r<br />For now They need to be cast in the correct order, for example warp first + throw second work, but throw first + warp second does not. \r<br />\r<br />[size=+1.5][color=Red]How To Get The Spells?[/color][/size]: The Spells are located in Dragons reach, in White Run. Inside Dragons reach go where The Blue Robe Mage is and Look for an chest behind the map.(Look at the Picture here in the mod as well)\r<br />[size=+2]Bugs[/size]\r<br />Nothing is perfect, but i am working to make it better and without bugs, so if you find any, or dont like an spell, please describe the problem. There aren&#39;t any serious issue, but those are the current ones\r<br />Singularity: Some times, the foe will float like if where in space, other times the foe will go to the ground, go back and go to the ground normally.\r<br />Slam: it does not always work, as it is terrain dependent. Also the foe is smashed in the ground 2 times.\r<br />Lift: lift makes the foe invulnerable for unknown reasons, if the player try to lift an object like an chair or alchemy table, the object will be electrified indefinably.\r<br />\r<br />[size=+2] Recommended[/size]\r<br />Apocalypse Spell Package by Enai Siaion\r<br />There you will find Many userfull and unique spells, Slam for example, was originaly made by Enai Siaion and the original spell can be founded  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16225]Here[/url] \r<br />[size=+2]Change log[/size]\r<br />0.1: started the mod, added warp, throw and biotic charge.\r<br />0.2: Small changes in warp, throw, and Biotic charge.
