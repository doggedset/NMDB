  "descriptionHtml": "Dragonborn Coin\r\n\r\nDue to requests, I have created several versions of this coin.\r\nSo far the available versions are:\r\n\r\n- Gold (Pristine, Dirty, Xtra Dirty)\r\n- Silver (Pristine, Dirty, Xtra Dirty)\r\n\r\n** Base textures when installed is the Gold Dirty version **\r\n\r\nHope someone out there will enjoy this as much as I did creating it.\r\n\r\nAside from the Dragons on the rear of the coin and the Skyrim Logo\r\nwhich is a simple trace then beveled in Photoshop, the coin is\r\ncrafted from the ground up. No pre-made textures, brushes, etc..\r\nwere used, all created using various things such as render clouds,\r\netc..\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nExtract the Textures and Meshes folders from this archive to your\r\nPath_To\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\ folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nBase install is Gold Dirty version. If you want an alternate version\r\nbrowse the archive and extract the texture folder for your desired\r\nversion to the Skyrim Data folder choosing yes to overwrite.\r\n\r\n** Be sure to install base first so you do not end up missing other\r\ntextures that are not included in the alternates folders. **\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\n----------\r\n\r\nDelete files coin01.dds, coin01_n.dds, coin01_e.dds, coin01_w.dds\r\nfrom Path_To\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Textures\\\\Crypton\\\\Misc\\\\ folder.\r\n\r\nDelete file coin01.nif from Path_To\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\meshes\\\\clutter\\\\\r\nfolder.",
