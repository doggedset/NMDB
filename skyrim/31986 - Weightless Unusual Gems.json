  "descriptionHtml": "Unusual Gems weigh nothing, and now they show that fact. \r\n\r\nI made this because I didn\\'t realize that quest items don\\'t actually weigh anything. If you somehow get them without the quest triggering, they will still weigh nothing with this mod installed. Since that\\'s only possible if you add it to your inventory, most people won\\'t actually need this mod. \r\n\r\nThis mod is a nitpick, something to fix a pet peeve. It has no impact on normal gameplay.",
