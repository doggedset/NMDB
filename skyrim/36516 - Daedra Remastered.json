  "summary": "Ever wondered why Daedric artifacts seemed to be weaker than some ebony and even daedric weapons and armor? Ever wondered why some daedric quests seemed like killing common bandits for loot? Well if you said yes to either of these questions, this my friend, is the mod for you.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Hello! This is a mod that I\\'ve had in the clockwork for a while that I decided to release. Have you ever wondered why the rewards from some daedric quests just weren\\'t that good. These are items created by almost god-like beings bestowed to you for furthering their own nefarious causes. Also, why did some of these quests simply seem like killing a bunch of common baddies? Well, this mod aims to fix that. Several pieces of weapons and armor have been buffed, and npc\\'s in those quests have been made MUCH harder to beat. Here is a changelog: \r\n\r\nAll Daedric artifacts now have 65235 charges (Its as high as the CK will go)\r\n\r\n-Buffed the damage to Dawnbreaker \r\n-Buffed the damage to the Mace of Malog Bal \r\n-Buffed the damage to Volendrung \r\n-Buffed the damage to Mehrune\\'s Razor \r\n-Buffed the damage to Sanguine\\'s Rose \r\n-Buffed the damage to Wabbajack \r\n-Buffed the damage to The Skull of Corruption \r\n-Buffed the enchantment to spellbreaker \r\n-Buffed the enchantment to Savior\\'s Hide \r\n-Buffed the enchantment to The Masque of Clavicus Vile \r\n\r\nHere are quests that I altered (some that needed to be could not be altered) \r\n\r\n-The Break of Dawn has had it\\'s NPC\\'s toughened \r\n-The House of Horrors has had it\\'s NPC\\'s toughened \r\n-Boethiah\\'s Calling has had it\\'s NPC\\'s toughened \r\n-Pieces of the Past has had it\\'s NPC\\'s toughened \r\n-Waking NIghtmare has had it\\'s NPC\\'s toughened \r\n-The Cursed Tribe has had it\\'s NPC\\'s toughened \r\n\r\nInstallation: Simple, Get the daedra_redone.esp into your data folder either manually or through NMM\r\n\r\nBe sure to let me know it anything seems to OP and any bugs that arise.
