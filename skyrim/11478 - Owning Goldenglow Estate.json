  "summary": "This mod fixes some of the problems with Goldenglow Estate after the player completes TG04: Scoundrel&#39;s Folly, such as hostile mercenaries and locked doors and chests. It also adds crafting stations, non-reseting chests, and more.",
  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE: Meh I&#39;ll add some stuff this week, but idk how easy spouse/ children are...\r<br />\r<br />If you&#39;ve gotten into the Theives Guild quest line, you may have noticed that after collecting both Goldenglow Bills of Sale, the estate supposedly belongs to you. Why then do the mercenaries attack you on site and are the doors still locked. This mod fixes problems with Goldenglow Estate, and adds some convenient things around the property.\r<br />\r<br />To make this clear all of the changes take place after you have completed the Theives Guild quest Scoundrel&#39;s Folly. Also the guards will attack your companion or horse once in a while (shouldn&#39;t happen but sometimes it buggs) if this happens use the console command &#34;addfac 0002a451&#34; on them.\r<br />\r<br />Current Features: \r<br />Inside:Added 4 display cases, 3 weapon plaques, an enchanting table, an alchemy lab, small decoration replacements, all doors and chests are now unlocked (after completing Scoundrel&#39;s Folly,) and chests no longer reset.\r<br />Outside:Added an anvil, a smelter, a chicken (because there are 2 nests, not 1), the gateguard opens the gate when the player approaches (after completing Scoundrel&#39;s Folly,) and the mercenaries will no longer attack the player (after completing Scoundrel&#39;s Folly.)\r<br />\r<br />Planned Features: \r<br />Small decoration changes, a steward to replace maven, another map marker for the house itself, and stables.\r<br />\r<br />If you have something you&#39;d like me to add, or a bug to report, don&#39;t be afraid to comment :3\r<br />\r<br />Update 1:\r<br />Fixed a bug with friendly mercenaries\r<br />Mercenaries are now hireable (replacing dead ones) through Maven Blackbriar.\r<br />You can repair beehives (through Maven,) causing them to bee harvestable. (See what I did there?)\r<br />Added a cooking pot to the kitchen.\r<br />\r<br />Steam version: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=13327&searchtext=",
