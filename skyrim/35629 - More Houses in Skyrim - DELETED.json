  "summary": "DROPPED TAKE OVER IF YOU WANT TO. This mod will add a new house into each of the nine holds throughout Skyrim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I am no longer doing any work on this mod if the fact that I haven't done anything to the files since I uploaded it in May 2013 wasn't enough reason for you. Anyone that wants to can take any files in this mod and use them and finish it is more than welcome. Or better yet just get some player homes that are finished and good in the areas you want them. I was only doing this to pass time while I was off work with an injury but after I went back I had no real desire to get back into it.\n<br />\n<br />This mod will add a new house into each of the nine holds throughout Skyrim. I will be trying to keep the houses to similar styles in the hold (I won't be putting a stone house made out of textures from the Reach into Riften's area). I decided to make this mod as there are no mods that added more than one house and even though I could have found nine different house mods it wouldn't have been ideal and would have just cramped my already large load order. Each of the houses will have a map marker and a fast travel point to them, I have also added a map marker and fast travel point to all the current houses that are in the vanilla game (plus Yorvaskr).\n<br />\n<br />Installation\n<br />\n<br />I recommend using the mod manager however if you like you can install it manually by extracting the file and dropping it into your data folder and activating it from the game launcher.\n<br />\n<br />Un-installation\n<br />\n<br />Again I recommend using the mod manager but otherwise it is the opposite of installing the mod by just deleting the files from your data folder. however if you delete the mod while still in the house or with stuff still in the houses I am unsure what will happen but I believe you will lose those items and/or corrupt your save game.\n<br />\n<br />Credits\n<br />\n<br />Bethseda for Skyrim and Creation Kit",
