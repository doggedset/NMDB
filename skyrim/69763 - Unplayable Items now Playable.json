  "modId": 69763.0,
  "modName": "Unplayable Items now Playable",
  "summary": "This mod unchecks the &#34;can&#39;t drop&#34; and enables the &#34;playable&#34; flags on all items marked as unplayable. There weren&#39;t as many as there were in Oblivion (working on that) but it should still be noticeable.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod has been updated as of 9/17/15, armor I missed has been added.\r<br />Will update after work tomorrow (Sept 30). Missed an amulet.\r<br />\r<br />DESCRIPTION\r<br />***********\r<br />This mod changes things to playable. Doesn&#39;t break any quests. When you kill a Draugr, it should now have lootable armor. There are some clipping issues, like Ulfric&#39;s Gag, and some things don&#39;t have a WorldItem, like Spriggan Shield. NPCs that die can be looted.\r<br />All items modified can be found in a barrel inside the QASmoke test cell, and has been integrated into blacksmith lists and bandit lists. Armor like Nightingale armor is unenchanted. \r<br />\r<br />ADDITIONAL NOTES\r<br />*****************\r<br />Items like &#39;wound test&#39; were inteded for display purposes only, like (SPOILER ALERT) for Astrid&#39;s death, and for other things as well. I have not gotten every item, as there are thousands of items to sift through. There may be compatability issues, but so far I have had none. Just make sure it&#39;s relatively low (last, preferably) in your load order.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]NOTICE\r<br />[/color]******\r<br />People who are using winRAR WILL HAVE PROBLEMS with .7z archives. You WILL get &#34;unknown method&#34; errors. This is because 7zip uses different compression algorithms to make the files smaller.\r<br />How does compression work? Programs capable of compressing files use mathematical equations to take data blocks that represent numbers and make those numbers smaller. Upon decompressing, the mathematical algorithm is reversed, thus giving the original data block number. WinRAR does not use the same algorithms as 7zip, hence the &#34;unknown method&#39; errors. 7zip  uses the highest compression ratios, making downloads faster because file is smaller. I will not change my archive type. If you want my mods download [url=http://www.7-zip.org/download.html]7zip[/url]. It&#39;s free.",
