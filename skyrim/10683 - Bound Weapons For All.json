  "descriptionHtml": "Adds all the bound weapons that Bethesda skipped! \r\n\r\nIn keeping with the original design of the bound weapons, I used Daedric weapons as the base model. In terms of damage, I\\'ve modeled all of the bound weapons off of steel, tweaked to attack slightly faster. The \\\"Mystic Binding\\\" perk will scale them up to deal damage equivalent to daedric (similar to the original bound weapons).\r\n\r\nCurrently contains:\r\n- Bound Dagger\r\n- Bound Mace\r\n- Bound War Axe\r\n- Bound Greatsword\r\n- Bound Warhammer\r\n\r\nSpell tomes are available near Farengar in Dragonsreach.\r\n\r\n***WANTED: If any 3d artist is interested in collaborating on tweaking the bound weapon enchant meshes to match the new weapons, please get in contact with me!",
