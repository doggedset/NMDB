  "summary": "Two unique weapons based off the transforming weapon from the Shivering Isles Dawnfang & Duskfang, currently the sword does not transform",
  "descriptionHtml": "The most unique sword from Oblivion in my eyes was Dawnfang/Duskfang because not only did it transform at sunrise and sunset but it also got more powerful when it had killed 12 creatures/people.\r\n\r\nThis mod aims to replicate Dawnfang/Duskfang however I\\'m not good enough at scripting in Papyrus to accomplish this right now so currently this mod does not have the script activated but it does contain the scripts and their source code for those willing to try their hand at getting it to transform.",
