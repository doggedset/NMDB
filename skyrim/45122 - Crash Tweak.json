  "summary": "A small numerical change to Skyrim\\'s INI that has eradicated crashing on my heavily modded Skyrim install.",
  "descriptionHtml": "In the Skyrim INI change \r\n\r\nuExterior Cell Buffer=36 ( default )\r\n\r\nto uExterior Cell Buffer=24\r\n\r\nThis has eliminated exterior crashing for me completely. Havent crashed in 3 weeks. Before this tweak I was lucky if I could go an hour. \r\n\r\nThe major mods I am using are 2k Textures full, SkyRe, Frostfall, Skyrim Immersive Creatures, Interesting NPC\\'s, and ASIS with Increased Spawns. \r\n\r\nAs a disclaimer I have no idea what this tweak will do to your game. I seem to be able to freely change this value without issue.",
