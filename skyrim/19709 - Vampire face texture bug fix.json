  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4]&lt;&lt;--Description--&gt;&gt;[/size]\n<br />Fixes that annoying bug with vampire face textures, the one when your face starts looking burnt/charred/etc.\n<br />I haven't been on nexus for quite a while, sorry if I didn't answer your questions in timely fashion.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]&lt;&lt;--Beta--&gt;&gt;[/size]\n<br />I might have found a more reliable and stable workaround for this bug, which will prevent it appearing in first place instead of fixing, but that needs further confirmation. For me this bug almost completely disappeared after Bethesda released several patches for the game, but it happened so that at the same time I started using ENB and got additional RAM.\n<br />From what I guess it is produced either by game engine coding (and then beth patches should fix it just fine), or by data overlapping in ram. We all know modded Skyrim is quite resource-hungry, and moreover it's executable is just x86, which applies several restrictions. For me this bug started appearing only after I modded Skyrim, so that's another pointer to the latter cause.\n<br />\n<br />It appears to me that the best fix for this bug (and several others) would be to use ENB. And no, if you don't want ENB's graphical alteration (I know some people just don't like it) you don't have to enable it. Thanks to ENB's developer there is an option to only utilize ENBoost - which doesn't alter Skyrim visuals in any way, but at the same time provides all the benefits of x64 systems, bigger ram and several other optimisation features. Basically it will make your game run better, more stable and produce less glitches/bugs.\n<br />\n<br />It will work mostly for x64 OS users, x86(32) will notice from less to no difference in performance.\n<br />There are basically 2 options:\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]&lt;&lt;--ENBoost--&gt;&gt;[/size]\n<br />If you do not want ENB visual alterations this one is for you. \n<br />\n<br />[list=1][*]Go to [url=http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrim.html]ENB website[/url] and download the latest version of ENB binaries (for NVidia users), for ATI users - get version 0.262 (new ATI driver is reported to have issues with newest ENB dll). All credit for ENB goes to it's author. Also it is not permitted to upload binaries on nexus, so you will have to go there. Download button is at the bottom of the page you get redirected to after choosing desired version.\n<br />[/*]\n<br />[*]Open archive you just downloaded, you need \"WrapperVersion\" folder\n<br />[/*]\n<br />[*]You want to extract d3d9.dll, enbhost.exe, and enblocal.ini to the Skyrim directory (same place where you put my fix files). You don't want to get any other folders/files found there, unless you want graphical effects from ENB. In that case check out recommendation in other option below.[/*]\n<br />[*]Once done extracting open enblocal.ini with a notepad (or similar software). You want to [i]find[/i] and [i]edit[/i] several lines.[/*]\n<br />[*]In section [GLOBAL][/*]\n<br />[*]UsePatchSpeedhackWithoutGraphics=true\n<br />[/*]\n<br />[*][size=2]UseDefferedRendering=false[/size]\n<br />[/*]\n<br />[*][size=2]In section [MEMORY][/size][/*]\n<br />[*][size=2]VideoMemorySizeMb=YOUR_VALUE (instructions below)[/size]\n<br />[/*]\n<br />[*][size=2]AutodetectVideoMemorySize=false[/size][/*]\n<br />[*][size=2]In section [ENGINE][/size][/*]\n<br />[*][size=2]ForceAnisotropicFiltering=false[/size]\n<br />[/*]\n<br />[*][size=2]EnableVSync=true[/size]\n<br />[/*]\n<br />[*][size=2]VSyncSkipNumFrames=0[/size][/*]\n<br />[*][size=2]Optional in section [WINDOW], for borderless fullscreen mode.[/size][/*]\n<br />[*][size=2]ForceBorderless=true[/size][/*]\n<br />[*][size=2]Set ForceBorderlessFullscreen=true[/size][/*]\n<br />[/list][size=2]\n<br />For step 9 - YOUR_VALUE is calculated this way - RAM+VRAM-2048. If you have SLI/CrossFire - only main card's VRAM counts.[/size]\n<br />[size=3]&lt;&lt;--ENB--&gt;&gt;[/size]\n<br />In this case you also get visual improvements, for this option I'd recommend one of Nexuses ENB presets. There are plenty to choose from, I'd recommend RealVision one with option B (my personal preference).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]&lt;&lt;--Installation--&gt;&gt;[/size]\n<br />Put included .txt files (not necessary all, you can choose ones you want, see File selection section) into Skyrim root directory (If you have Steam it will be steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;skyrim, basically folder with your TESV.exe).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]&lt;&lt;--Usage--&gt;&gt;[/size]\n<br />Load your save game, if your face is bugged open console and type\n<br />\n<br />For all races:\n<br />bat #v\n<br />\n<br />where # is replaced with letter:\n<br />i - for Imperials (Cyrodils)\n<br />n - for Nords\n<br />b - for Bretons (Manmer)\n<br />r - for Redguards\n<br />d - for Dunmer (Dark Elves)\n<br />h - for Altmer (High Elves)\n<br />w - for Bosmer (Wood Elves)\n<br />o - for Orcs\n<br />a - for Argonians\n<br />k - for Khajiit\n<br />\n<br />press \"Enter\"\n<br />that will fix your face and eyes\n<br />\n<br />This fix doesn't have any side-effects, unless you run a wrong command (for inappropriate race). It will not reset your skills or anything, it is really low-risk fix. Also it will not work with custom races.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]&lt;&lt;--File selection--&gt;&gt;[/size]\n<br />\n<br />You don't have to install all files if you are not going to play some of the included races.\n<br />\n<br />-If you are not going to use mod to fix Redguards - don't install file with name rv.txt\n<br />-If you are not going to use mod to fix Orcs - don't install file with name ov.txt\n<br />-and so on\n<br />\n<br />Basically just choose files you need (their names are coded same way as console commands) and install them.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]&lt;&lt;--Full list of files--&gt;&gt;[/size]\n<br />\n<br />av.txt\n<br />bv.txt\n<br />dv.txt\n<br />hv.txt\n<br />iv.txt\n<br />kv.txt\n<br />nv.txt\n<br />ov.txt\n<br />rv.txt\n<br />wv.txt\n<br />readme.txt",
