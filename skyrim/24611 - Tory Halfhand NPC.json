  "summary": "An attempt at a request seen on the Nexus forums. Dump3d0ut requested an NPC from an image, this is my attempt at it.",
  "descriptionHtml": "An attempt at creating a new NPC based off of an image for a request by Dump3d0ut. This adds a marriable NPC to the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun. Go talk to the guy in Riften, pay the 200g to get the Amulet of Mara, then go talk to Tory Halfhand. Things should go smoothely. Any comments, questions, concerns, etc, please leave a comment, this is my first upload to the nexus and plan on many more once I get better with the CK and the 3d modeling programs.\r\n\r\nThanks to the creator of the ApachiiHair mod. Not only is it great for female models but also with males.",
