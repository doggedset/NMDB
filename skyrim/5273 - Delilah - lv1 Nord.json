  "descriptionHtml": "This save uses, but does not 100% require (afaik), the following mods, found here on SkyrimNexus:\r\n\r\nBetter Females by Bella - Version 3\r\nNo More Blocky Faces\r\nCoolsims Hair Pack\r\nCoolsims Hair Retexture\r\nCalientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition -CBBE- - Vanilla Edition\r\n\r\nThis is my first time uploading anything, and my first time trying to submit got an error, so I\\'ll edit actual links in later. For now I don\\'t think it\\'s all that much work to copy/paste into the search bar to find the above mods.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I\\'ve messed anything up, and of course please have fun!\r\n\r\nI\\'m aware of the gap at the back. Hopefully that\\'ll eventually be fixed. It\\'s not really within my abilities to fix it myself. If it bothers you, just don\\'t install the Coolsims hair, and it\\'ll default to the vanilla styles.\r\n",
