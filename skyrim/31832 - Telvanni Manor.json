  "descriptionHtml": "***DRAGONBORN IS REQUIRED***\r\nTelvanni Tower is amazing isn\\'t it? Wouldn\\'t you want to live in a giant mushroom, if the anwser is yes, than lucky for you, now you can. Telvanni Manor is a simple and elegant house accompied by an outhouse. It has everything you need and possibly more. Some features include: Storage areas, alchemy table, forge and a great and original exterior. \r\n\r\nTo gain access to the manor you must find the key. The location of the key can be found on a note held in place on the door by a knife. I would also like to state that this is my first house mod and would really appreciate some feedback on things like: how can I improve and maybe some requests for the future.\r\n\r\nThanks and don\\'t forget, ****Dragonborn is Required**** ",
