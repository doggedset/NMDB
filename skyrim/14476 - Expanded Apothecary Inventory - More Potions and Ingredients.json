  "descriptionHtml": "This mod increases the number of potions and ingredients for sale at apothecaries.\r\n\r\nRare ingredients are still rare, but common ingredients are much more plentiful. Distribution is still random, but one to two dozen of each ingredient is typical.\r\n\r\nPotions are also much more plentiful. Distribution is again random, but some apothecaries have slightly different amounts of different categories of potions. Babette of the Dark Brotherhood sells more poisons than the average apothecary, for example.\r\n\r\n[b]Compatibility and Issues[/b]\r\n\r\nThis mod alters the merchant containers for every apothecary in Skyrim. It will therefore conflict with any other mod that changes any apothecary\\'s inventory.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this screws up any apothecary\\'s inventory. Replacing all those inventories was an error-prone task, so I may have made a mistake somewhere.\r\n\r\n[b]Alternatives[/b]\r\n\r\nThis mod is similar to HornedReaperMJL\\'s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=1558]Alchemists Have Ingredients[/url], which also increases the number of ingredients for sale. This mod differs in that the resulting ingredient counts are still random, rare ingredients are not affected, and potions are also more plentiful.",
