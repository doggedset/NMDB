  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][b][u]Description:[/u]\r<br />[/b][/size]\r<br />This is a update made for the Mod: &#34;Real Flying (with Gliding and Collisions)&#34; by Anton.\r<br />99,9% of the credits for it Belongs to him.\r<br />What I made is just the tedious work of creating via CK the recipes for the Wing Variations Anton created himself.\r<br />\r<br />All of the scripting, glitches, etc, will be exactly the same from the &#34;Original Real Flying&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Features:[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />- Added all the 9 Existing recipes from &#34;Real Flying - Dragon Wing Variations&#34; to be made at the Cooking Pot;\r<br />- All recipes are more or less difficult to be made. Some by Bravery, others by patience, to provide a feeling of progression. (Call me a masochist, but I don&#39;t like the idea of Flying even before you can buy a horse);\r<br />- &#34;Real Flying - Scripts Update 01&#34; was already applied in the Zip File;\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][size=4]Requirements:\r<br />[/size][/b][/u]\r<br />SKSE and FNIS (and Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package for Visual Studio 2013 (x86)) - Same as Real Flying\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][size=4]Installation:\r<br />[/size][/b][/u]\r<br />- First, REMOVE the original &#34;Real Flying&#34; files. Some files will be replaced, and others (like textures and meshes) I had to rename. So, do it&#33;\r<br />- Unpack archive to the game&#39;s folder and activate mod in launcher.\r<br />- Run &#34;Generate FNIS for Users.exe&#34; and press &#34;Update&#34; button.\r<br />- Cook the &#34;Mutagen&#34; in any cooking pot, then drink it.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Known issues:[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />- The same inherited from Real Flying;\r<br />- If you drink two different Mutagen Potions, and then &#34;Cure&#34; them, your jump height will be the same as when you had the wings, and it will be fixed only after restarting the game;\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Credits:\r<br />[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />All credits toÂ Anton0028: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/437824/?\r<br />[b]The mind behind it, and thanks for authorizing me to distribute this update&#33;[/b]",
