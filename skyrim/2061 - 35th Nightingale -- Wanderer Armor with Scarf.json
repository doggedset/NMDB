  "descriptionHtml": "**************__--UPDATE--__***************\r<br />Version 3.0 has been uploaded.\r<br />Armor is now standalone&#33;  No longer replaces Nightingale; now called &#39;Wanderer&#39;.\r<br />Feel free to rename, as the set is now unenchanted.\r<br />All four pieces can be crafted with some Leather and Leather Strips at a Forge.\r<br />All four pieces can be improved at a Workbench with said materials.\r<br />Updated textures using the new HD files released by Bethesda.\r<br />**************************************************\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />**************__--UPDATE--__***************\r<br />Version 2.0 has been uploaded.\r<br />Female meshes and textures added.\r<br />**************************************************\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Description:\r<br />This is a tanned leather and charcoal variant of the Nightingale armor set, utilizing the Torn Scarf meshes and transparencies. (Huge thanks to AlphaDragoon and Gilead Maerlyn for their work on the Scarf Variant and Capeless Variant, respectively.)\r<br />\r<br />In addition to the overall color changes, some patterns and line-work have been implemented, along with a little scrubbing of the grunge present in the original look. The result is an armor set that is simple and unobtrusive - while being slightly more intricate, colorful, and clean. Nocturnal may or may not approve, but it should still be a fitting look for Skyrim&#39;s rangers, thieves, and assassins.\r<br />\r<br />Due to the obscene number of Nightingale retextures and recolors, this was originally only going to be for my personal use. After spending entirely way too much time working on it instead of actually playing, I thought I may as well upload it in the off chance I might save someone else a little hassle.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Simply extract the archive into the Skyrim folder, so the .esp, textures folder, and meshes folder all land into your skyrim/data directory.\r<br />Typically:\r<br />C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim\r<br />or\r<br />C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />This wouldn&#39;t have been possible without the efforts of two skilled modders:\r<br />\r<br />AlphaDragoon for his brilliant Torn Scarf Variant of the Nightingale Armor, as well as generously allowing me to include his meshes. Check out his mod:\r<br />http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1584\r<br />\r<br />Gilead Maerlyn for his work and knowledge on transparencies. If you don&#39;t like anything hanging from the back, consider his Capeless Nightingale mod:\r<br />http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1560",
