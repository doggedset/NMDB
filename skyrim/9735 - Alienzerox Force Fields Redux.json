  "summary": "My Force Fields do not take up a equipment slot so you can wear whatever you want on top of them, robes, regular clothes even a full set of armor! The \\\"Powered\\\" variants will automatically search & destroy your enemies while you are sneaking around and if your sneak skills are high enough you\\'ll be able to do it without having to physically rais",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b]>>15/02/12<< Alienzerox Force Fields Redux[/b][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal---I was able to finagle CK into giving me use of gemstones for the icon and ground model for the Force Fields so that it can remain as an ESP without the need of textures or meshes ... it\\'s still strictly code using assets from the default game, but now it has a shiny gem that you can keep in your inventory & if you accidently drop it you can pick it back up, cool huh?\r\n\r\nTo use these effectively you should first \\\"favorite\\\" it then while in your \\\"quick menu\\\" assign it a number key from the top of the keyboard (NOT THE NUMPAD) \r\n\r\nSo I spend about an hour rebuilding the ESP with CK then playtested it for a couple of missions & didn\\'t find any issues ... to save myself time I used the console to get the components and then built the FFs to make sure that it could still be done. I don\\'t really care how you decide to obtain these since it\\'s your play thru but it would be more satisfying & rewarding by doing the quests to get the swag IMHO.\r\n\r\nAll FFs are craftable under the Daedric category once you have collected all of the required components & are upgradable at the bench.\r\n\r\n\r\nFireField and FrostField are safe to use around friendlies so it\\'s fine if it\\'s \\\"activated\\\" all the time also it\\'s awesome for defense while you\\'re mounted, no need to get off your ride to fend off attackers.\r\n  \r\nElectroField is pure offensive and will atack anything that comes within spitting distance. It will hurt your mount and follower so use only on solo raid missions. \r\n\r\nAll 3 Powered Units has constant invisiblity (only while sneaking) so if your stealth skills are up to par you will definitely pass detection checks ... muffle is on constantly.\r\n\r\nVanilla FF light & heavy can be enchanted (if you are using the 4 enchant slots mod you can have fire, frost, shock & magic wards or fortify health & health regen & fortify magic & magic regen) but the choice is ultimately yours to make.\r\n\r\n\r\nheavy has a armor base of 75 \r\n\r\nlight has a armor base of 50 \r\n\r\npowered variants only come in light and have a armor base of 45\r\n\r\n\r\nI decided that it would in my best interest to make a new page for this so it wouldn\\'t start off buried as an updated file, As soon as this is up and running I will remove my other.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation is a simple drop into data folder then activate using your mod manager, keep it near the bottom of your load order for best results ... if you are a previous user remove the ForceFieldLTD.esp from your queue & just use this new one, then fire up your console to get your FFs back... savvy? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank You all for your interest & support! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAZ\r\n\r\n====================================================================================================================================\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nBethesda for providing us an incredible gaming experience\r\nBethesda Creation Kit so that I was finally able to successfully provide an inventory/ground texture\r\nCoffee ... lots of coffee",
