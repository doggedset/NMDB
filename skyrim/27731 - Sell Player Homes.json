  "summary": "This simple mod allows you to sell any of the vanilla player homes. Once sold, you will receive the original amount of gold back (but only from the building, not any additions), lose the key and the building will become locked. If at any point you decide to buy back the home, any additions you may have bought before will still be there.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This simple mod allows you to sell any of the vanilla player homes. Once sold, you will receive the original amount of gold back (but only from the building, not any additions), lose the key and the building will become locked. If at any point you decide to buy back the home, any additions you may have bought before will still be there.\r\n\r\nIf you sell a home in which a housecarl lives, he/she will move to the palace of that city and sandbox there. If you buy the home again, he/she will move back and resume as previous. [b]To accomplish this the housecarl AI packages have been adjusted, so there might be some compatibility issues with mods changing the housecarls - load those after this one if they\\'re important for you.[/b]\r\n\r\nThe mod is fully compatible with both Dawnguard and Hearthfire - and probably even with mods that change the homes. I\\'ve also added existing voiced dialog to make it fit in properly. If you encounter any bugs, let me know :)",
