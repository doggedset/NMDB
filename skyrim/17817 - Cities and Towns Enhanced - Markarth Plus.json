  "modName": "Cities and Towns Enhanced - Markarth Plus",
  "summary": "This mod adjusts the scenery and lighting in Markarth. All the exterior light sources have been properly set, Dwarven ruins have been added to the cliff sides and town, and many new trees and foliage have been added (as well as some old trees removed).",
  "descriptionHtml": "(formerly known as Markark+ (Trees & Ruins)\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]About[/b][/size]\r\nThis is a visual mod created for Markarth for none other than my own enjoyment. I was sick of the scraggly and dead looking trees that inhabited the city grounds. Instead, I thought some pines might fit the old mountainside a bit better with a few floral touches here and there. Not to be forgotten is the eye-candy Dwarven ruins in the mountainsides - although it is currently of no practical use.\r\n\r\n[size=3][color=yellow][b]Video Showcase[/color][/b][/size] (as well as a few other mods): (Thanks ArsenalRobert!)\r\nHere is the address to the youtube video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDAc9mEoXQM\r\n\r\n[b]NOTE:[/b] The newer screenshots have the lighting fixes. The older shots are from the first released version and lack many things.\r\n\r\nThis mod should be fully compatible with any other mods that do not modify the city of Markarth or the cliffs that surround it.\r\n\r\nThere is a steam workshop version of the mod known as: \\\"Markarth+ (Trees & Ruins)\\\"\r\nThanks for checking it out and if you like it (or even if you don\\'t) please leave a comment .\r\n- Harleyvitality\r\n\r\n\r\nOther mods used in Screenshots:\r\nSuperl3 ENB RL (modified)\r\nSkyrim HD - 2k Textures\r\nVurt\\'s Skyrim Flora Overhaul\r\nEnhanced Night Skyrim\r\nStatic Mesh Improvement Mod\r\nLush Grass & Trees (not so sure this is actually in there but just to be safe)\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re into an actual quest and a thought-out story for a player-home mod, please check our Ironlion\\'s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17825]Alfheim Hall[/url] mod: . He did a really nice job setting up the farm to look and feel like it belongs there.\r\n\r\n[b][size=4]CHANGELOG:[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nv0.3\r\nFixed a pine tree that was floating near treasury.\r\nChanged the broken pipe waterfall effect.\r\nAdded new sound to that same waterfall.\r\nIncreased the \\\"flow\\\" of the river after the waterfall - due to the excess water coming down from the broken pipe (it just makes sense).\r\nFine-tuned a few light sources around the town.\r\nIncreased the size of the large coal basin piles. They were small coals in a large basin. They should now look more appropriate for the size of the basin.\r\nAdded some new ruins and decoration on the mountains.\r\nHOPEFULLY fixed the issue with the towers not rendering properly on some games.\r\n\r\nv0.25\r\nRemoved magical floating rock.\r\nTweaked lighting levels around Apothecary & Keep entrance.\r\nAdded new coal basin near Ogmund\\'s house.\r\nAttempted to add many new insect spawns (This is proving annoyingly difficult to keep them going).\r\nSOMEHOW missed the lighting near the Silver-blood Inn - It is fixed now.\r\nAdded a few more light sources and modified a few as well.\r\n\r\nv0.2\r\nAdded Lighting to Smelter\r\nAdded A few new Coal Basins\r\nProperly adjusted all exterior lighting in Markarth (There is a mod that does this but I just felt like making my own adjustments).\r\nProperly adjusted the waterfall sound (finally).\r\nAdded a few more trees.\r\nFixed a few graphical glitches in the Dwarven ruins.\r\n\r\nv0.15\r\nAdjusted waterfall sound from Dwarven pipe.\r\nAdded hanging coal basins on main defensive wall.\r\nAdded a bit more Dwarven ruin scenery.\r\nAdded more foliage to the Southern side.\r\nAdded more pine trees and a few Aspen trees.\r\nHanging moss near Treasury was scaled down.\r\n\r\nVersions:\r\nCurrent version - 0.3\r\nPrevious version - 0.25\r\n\r\n[size=4][color=FF0000]Possible BUGS:[/color][/size]\r\nThe tilted tower sometimes does not render properly. No reports of other structures doing this yet.\r\n\r\n[color=green]Fix: Press F5 then F9 and it should appear.[/color] Not something I seem to be able to fully fix.",
