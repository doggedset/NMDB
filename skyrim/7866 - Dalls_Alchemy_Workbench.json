  "descriptionHtml": "---README---\r\n\r\nfor DALLs - Alchemy_Workbench \r\n\r\nv1.0\r\n\r\n06/02/2012\r\n\r\nAlchemy_Workbench is custom re-texturing (n not some simple - in part - recolor) mod which changes how Alchemy Workbench n Workstation looks.*\r\n\r\n* Word of warning - my work actually do changes how these items look - rather then \\\"polishes\\\" same / boring game \\\"apple\\\" a bit further as many other popular mods do - so it might not be fit for casual modders or more-of-same seekers.\r\n\r\nWhy my game textures look as they do: All textures I make are closer to original game Art / Game Art concept (short of some minor technical n aesthetic changes) then are those you have in your game. How is that possible? If you know process of texture (game Art) making that will be obvious but if you don\\'t it will suffice to say that this process (like any other) has various stages which serve different purposes. Brilliantly done - Original Art in game is \\\"covered\\\" in \\\"immersion\\\" grime n dirt probably out of necessity - as quite lot users / potential game buyers insist on low-key (dark) games - which they (users) find as more interesting / much more \\\"realistic\\\" (immersive). So if you want to \\\"see\\\", what you think is there you better avoid my re-texture mods - on other hand if you want to see what original Artists and I have (really) done there - go for them. ;)\r\n\r\nThis is Master Alchemist Workbench intended for one of my forthcoming real mods and as such, it might not be suitable for novice Alchemists which need helping step-by-step (bench) diagrams. If I were not asked for it - you probably would have to wait on it a bit longer but as there are some nice - Master - Alchemist keen on acquiring proper / no-nonsense kit worth their outstanding potion making skills - you can have it now. ;) \r\n\r\nTo install you need to navigate to your Steam/SteamApps/common/skyrim - game folder and paste / drag n drop in it my Data (mod) folder. Allow overwrite!    \r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t like this new look, simply delete / remove my (check for names my mod) texture files from Data/textures/clutter n effects - and original look will be restored to your game.\r\n\r\nBugs/conflicts: none known - but take care not to overwrite them (my textures) by accident!\r\n  \r\nUse:\r\nFree to use but if any files included (therein) are to be used for modding ask me for permission!\r\n\r\nEnjoy and try to remember - if you like it even in a part - to give endorsement! \r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for really great game.\r\n\r\n",
