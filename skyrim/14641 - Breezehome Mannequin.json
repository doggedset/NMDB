  "summary": "V1.2\r\n\r\nThis is a simple mod that adds a mannequin to Breezehome. It also adds a chest, strongbox and a knapsack next to it for quick and easy storage. I always hated having to walk upstairs just to store some items. I also hated not having a mannequin in Breezehome to store my favorite armor. This mod aims to solving those issues. ",

Both the mannequin and containers are located underneath the stairs.\r\n[u]The contents of this mod will only be available once the player has purchased the dinning room set for Breezehome.[/u]\r\n\r\n[Color=Gold]=Installation=[/COLOR]\r\n\r\nPlace the Breezehome Mannequin .esp file in your Skyrim data folder or use Nexus Mod Manager.\r\n\r\n[Color=Gold]=Uninstall=[/COLOR]\r\n\r\nDelete the Breezehome Mannequin .esp file in your Skyrim data folder or use Nexus  Mod Manager.\r\n\r\n[Color=Gold]=Troubleshooting=[/COLOR]\r\n\r\nAs with all mannequins in Skyrim, they have a mind of their own. If you don\\'t see the mannequin upon first entering Breezehome just leave and come back.\r\nIf he is jumping around the just do the same. Sometimes the mannequins also change the pose or stance as well. Just leave and come back.\r\n\r\nI have also found that if the mannequin refuses to stop moving and such you open the console and type PCB while in Breezehome, leave then comeback\r\nit straightens out.  \r\n\r\n[Color=Gold]=Compatibility=[/COLOR]\r\n\r\nBreezehome Mannequin should be compatible with all mods and most mannequin changing mods.\r\n\r\nIf you find an incompatible mod please let me know and I\\'ll list it. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10652]Vanilla Mannequin Script Fix[/url] to fix most mannequin related issues.\r\n\r\n[Color=Gold]=Known Bugs=[/COLOR]\r\n\r\n[Color=Red]If you have the Hearthfire expansion there is an option to turn the Brezeehome alchemy area into a child\\'s bedroom. If this option is taken the door is moved drastically to the left, almost right behind the mannequin. Making that option [b]NOT[/b] compatible with this mod.[/COLOR]  \r\n\r\n[img]http://img826.imageshack.us/img826/1144/tesv2013041915322661.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nIf you have [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9131]Female Mannequins[/url] installed, then you install this mod the mannequins will change back to male. To fix this just reinstall Female Mannequins, and the problem should be fixed.\r\n\r\nIf you find any please let me know and I\\'ll try to fix it.\r\n\r\n[Color=Gold]=Future Updates=[/COLOR]\r\n\r\nPossibly more mannequins in the bedroom or loft area. Also maybe more weapon plaques and weapon racks. Stay tuned.\r\n\r\nWill be adding alternate locations for the mannequin very soon!\r\n\r\n[Color=Gold]=Version History=[/COLOR]\r\n\r\n1.2\r\n-Added a knapsack, strongbox and candles around the mannequin\r\n-The storage containers should now be 100% player owned\r\n-The contents of this mod will only be available once the player has purchased the dinning room set for Breezehome\r\n\r\n1.1\r\n-Fixed an issue with the upstairs chest being named wrong\r\n\r\n1.0 \r\n-Initial release\r\n\r\n[Color=Gold]=Feedback=[/COLOR]\r\n\r\nIf you guys have any suggestions to help enhance this mod or any features you would like to see added feel free to let me know.\r\n\r\n[Color=Gold]=Permissions=[/COLOR]\r\n\r\nPlease do not modify my mod in any way unless asking for permission first.
