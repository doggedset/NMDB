  "descriptionHtml": "in this case, every single coin, and if you rob a person of their coin, the model is now a doughnut.\r\n\r\nIt looks like something you can make outta playdough, but please, do not ingest. For all we know, this is pure Bronze, and I don\\'t wanna know what kind of poisoning this can do to an infant.\r\n\r\nso, this has purple icing, and a horrid bread texture that looks like plastic... but it still makes me laugh whenever I pickpocket it off of someone. hopefully will be the same effect for others alike.\r\n\r\nonly error... well, sorta, I think i can fix it with changing the collisions: it stands halway into the table from the base of the doughnut.",
