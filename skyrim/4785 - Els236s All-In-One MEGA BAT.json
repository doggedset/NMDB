  "descriptionHtml": "This is probably THE biggest BAT file for Skyrim I have ever done, or anyone has done. The whole file took me practically 2 hours to put together, which for a simple text file, is pretty damn long. Everything took me ages to sort-out so that you could check item Ids and what-not. I made this for those who want to restart Skyrim, the way they finished it.\r\n\r\nWhen run in-game this BAT will:\r\n- Set all skills to level 100\r\n- Set the player to level 81\r\n- Give the player decent stats (health, magicka, stamina, unarmed damage, carry-weight)\r\n- Unlock all perks in every skill-set\r\n- Teach the player every single dragon-shout that isn\\'t quest related\r\n- Give the player enough Dragon-Souls to unlock them all\r\n- Give the player a decent amount of every single crafting item\r\n- Give the player a decent amount of every ingredient (non-quest)\r\n- Give the player a few decent and useful potions\r\n- Give the player a mixture of food\r\n- Give the the player a Lock-Pick (only one is needed thanks to unbreakable perk)\r\n- Give the player 50000 Gold Coins\r\n- Give the player a pickaxe and woodcutter\\'s axe\r\n- Give the player a decent amount of gems\r\n- Give the player a decent amount of Soul-Gems\r\n- Give the player a full Ancient-Nord Armour set\r\n- Give the player a full Nord-Hero Weapons set\r\n- Give the player a decent amount of arrows\r\n\r\nIf you want me to add anything else, then let me know. Any endorsement would be much appreciated, thanks.",
