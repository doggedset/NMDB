  "descriptionHtml": "Malkor, a Bosmer nightblade currently hiding from the Thalmor. Once a Justiciar in Valenwood, he&#39;s fled to Skyrim to escape the ever present stranglehold of the Aldmeri Dominion. \r<br />\r<br />When the Last Dragonborn first meets Malkor he is hiding out in Riverwood&#39;s Sleeping Giant Inn, having found one of the only safe havens against the Thalmor.\r<br />\r<br />Trained from an early age to become a Justiciar, Malkor has demonstrated notable skill with fire magic, particularly amongst his Bosmeri brethren. Along with Destruction magic, he shows the typical Bosmer skill with Archery and Sneak, hence his decision to train as a nightblade. \r<br />\r<br />Currently wearing Gilded Elven Armor, Malkor wields an Elven Longsword he&#39;s enchanted to trap the souls of his fallen enemies, as well as an Elven Bow.\r<br />\r<br />Malkor will level with your character, and of course will wear any gear given to him so long as it is better than what he&#39;s currently wearing. Eventually I plan to add custom dialogue, so he&#39;s more than a generic character with a typed up background. Hopefully you enjoy&#33;",
