  "descriptionHtml": "Makes all the animals...super-sized (3x bigger). Trolls ARE included. Domestic animals are NOT included, by popular request. Just subscribe and walk around Skyrim for a while- it\\'s great for kicks.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: I have done limited testing with no bugs (other than a troll getting stuck in a tree), but you should SAVE your game BEFORE you use this mod, especially when entering interior cells. I haven\\'t seen this mod in every interior cell, so some oversized creatures may not fit in smaller cells, particularly trolls.\r\n\r\nVersion: 1.01\r\nAuthor: WarriorG0el\r\n\r\nI love clear feedback, good or bad! Let me know if there\\'s anything else you\\'d like to see in this mod, or any bugs that I can fix.\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\n1.0 (Release) - All modifiable animals, including trolls, have 3 times their normal height and weight.\r\n1.01 - All dogs, domestic goats and chickens are back to normal size due to popular request. Wild goats are still 3x normal size.\r\n\r\nThanks very much!\r\n\r\nOther WG Mods:\r\n\r\nItem Rewards For Bounties:  Adds a random leveled item as a reward upon quest completion, and changes bounty rewards to 250 gold for Bandits/Forsworn, 500 gold for Giants and 750 gold for dragons. \r\n\r\nUndying Companions: Makes all companions essential, meaning they cannot die by friendly or hostile damage. Exceptions: Erandur, Cicero and Eola.\r\n\r\nBreezehome Enchanting Table - Adds an enchanting table to Breezehome right next to the Alchemy Lab. Will only show up once Alchemy Lab decoration is purchased from Proventus in Dragonsreach. Mood lighting included.\r\n\r\nEnhanced Alchemy XP - Slightly increases Alchemy XP gain rate (20%) to balance with other skills such as Smithing. Still balanced, more fun.\r\n\r\nImproved Imperial Racial Abilities - Changes Voice of the Emperor ability to a +10 Speech bonus for people like me who never use Voice of the Emperor when they roll Imperial characters.\r\n\r\nVisible Slaughterfish - Makes only slaughterfish 3x bigger so you can see them more easily.\r\n\r\nEvil Slaughterfish - Makes slaughterfish much more dangerous: 3x damage, 2.5x speed, 3.1x attack chance and 2x health.\r\n\r\nSkyscraper Giants - Makes giants 3x bigger.\r\n\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/WarriorG0el/myworkshopfiles/",
