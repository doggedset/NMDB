  "descriptionHtml": "This is a mod I made because I couldn&#39;t find any others that did something similar. Most other houses I&#39;ve seen have like 85 weapon racks, and 48 mannequins and I never had enough gear to fill them all.  I also didn&#39;t need automatic shelves, more crafting tools, or anything else.  All I wanted was a cool place to show off quest items. So here it is.\r<br />\r<br />Includes mounting locations for:\r<br />-Dragon Claws\r<br />-Dragon Priest Masks\r<br />-Daedric Artifacts\r<br />-Paragon Jewels\r<br />-Elder Scrolls\r<br />-Black Books\r<br />-Bugs in a Jar\r<br />-Most of the unique/artifact weapons and armor I could identify (with a few exceptions)\r<br />\r<br />Requires:\r<br />Dawnguard, Hearthfire, Dragonborn DLC\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />Arthmoor for lots of random help along the way\r<br />Sjogga for some tutorials I used to get started\r<br />Berticus for some tutorials and also the &#39;shell&#39; of the basement that I cleaned out and redecorated ",
