Twist it, turn it, change the color. I look forward to seeing what you make.\r<br />\r<br />Two versions are provided here: a .svg version, and a .png version. The .svg file is the vectorized version that you have to use a graphics editor to open, and you can resize to your needs. The .png file is the regular bitmap version for people who donâ€™t have access to or are not used to using a graphics editor. The .png file is 5431 x 10080, so it should be large enough for just about any project and can be downscaled to your needs.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Usage[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]After you&#39;ve downloaded the file, use a graphics editor like Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, or Inkscape to open the .svg file. For the .png version, you can use a graphics editor or an image editor like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or Paint.NET.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][b]Permissions[/b][/font][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Feel free to use this graphic in your work. You don&#39;t have to credit me, but it would be nice if you did nonetheless. However, if you have any ideas on how to improve it, please let me know before you distribute it yourself. If you want to upload this Artist&#39;s Resource elsewhere, besides Nexus, make sure you credit me as its original author and provide a link back to this mod page.[/font][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Consider checking out my other files[/size][/b][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[center][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64439][img]http://i.imgur.com/mh1K6B7.png[/img][/url] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68479][img]http://i.imgur.com/jPVwKXA.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/uHx5b21.png[/img]",
