But then I took an arrow in the knee\\\" play only once\r\n* Makes Olfina Grey-Mane\\'s \\\"What\\'s the matter? You can\\'t stand the sight of a strong Nord woman?\\\" play only once.\r\n* Makes Mila Vilentia\\'s \\\"I work with my mother, to sell fruits and vegetables. It\\'s fun most days, but hard work.\\\" play only once.\r\n* Makes Nazeem\\'s condescending cloud district line play only once\r\n* Makes Braith\\'s \\\"What are you looking at? I\\'m not afraid of you\\\" line play only once\r\n\r\n\r\nPlaying with this mod on an existing savegame where you heard those before, they won\\'t be repeated. If you start a new game, they will play only once.\r\n\r\nGot any other NPC lines that grind your gears? Let me know in the comments, maybe I can include them in an update.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.0\r\n* Makes Olfina Grey-Mane\\'s \\\"What\\'s the matter?
