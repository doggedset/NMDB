  "summary": "Alpha stages of my current Arena Mod. Very Limited.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Project is officially discontinued. I hate letting all the hours of work go to waste, but it&#39;s not worth finishing at this point. The modding community is a lot smaller than it was in Skyrims first 2 years, and any further work I put into this mod is probably going to go unnoticed. In hindsight, I really should have started modding this immediately after they released the dev kit.\r<br />\r<br />The mod is staying up though because it is still in decent shape. You can fight 10 or so NPC&#39;s in the arena, and some are sort of interesting. \r<br />LOCATION: Near rorikstead, and should be visible on your map already without discovering it.\r<br />\r<br />Sorry to anyone who&#39;s hopes I might have gotten up. Won&#39;t be making this same mistake twice tho. Idk what Fallout 4 is going to look like or what tools I&#39;ll have at my disposal, but I&#39;ll be surprised if they don&#39;t release a dev kit that&#39;s similar to the one in Skyrim. As soon as they release that I&#39;m going to start development on a new project right away. \r<br />\r<br />Until then I feel like I should promote this guy&#39;s arena http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50892/?tab=1&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D50892%26preview%3D&pUp=1\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s pretty good, definitely the best arena on the nexus.",
