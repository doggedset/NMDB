  "descriptionHtml": "This is a character created to look like Princess Zelda.\r\nI based her creation on the looks of Princess Zelda as she appears on the game Super Smash Bros for the Wii.\r\nPlease not that as of now vanilla Skyrim has limited options for character creation.\r\nI found the correct nose preset,and adjusted her chin and cheekbones to match as in the picture I used as a sample.I found a haircut preset that is basically the same haircut as in the sample picture,with the difference being how long hair are.Unfortunately Skyrim doesn\\'t let us to adjust the size of the hairstyles.\r\nThe most important problem with this character is that Vanilla Skyrim doesn\\'t have an eye preset resembling the shape of Princess Zelda\\'s eye shape,and most default eye shapes are ugly.\r\nBecause of that I chose the less ugly eye shape,but still it\\'s very different than Zelda\\'s true eye shape.\r\nAs for the color of her eyes I used a mod that allows High Elves to have same eye colors as humans,so Zelda can have her blue eyes.\r\nSo the mod to make it able for elves to have human colored eyes is recommended.\r\nThis mod is not over yet.When and if new eye shapes or hairstyles come out,the mod will be updated accordingly.\r\nZelda is of course a High Elf. (duh!)\r\n\r\n\r\nRecomended mod: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=195",
