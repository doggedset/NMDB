  "descriptionHtml": "*** 6 / 21 / 12 UPDATE ***\r\nThis retexture is included in zaph72\\'s craftable version used with permission as \\\"Royal Elven Armor\\\" - Many of you have been asking for a craftable version and here it is! Great work Zaph! \r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19161\r\n\r\n**********************************\r\n\r\n[b]If you like it, please endorse it! : ) [/b]\r\n\r\nThis mod is a texture repaint of all of the elven armor and weapons. \r\nI liked the green they used, but it felt too cheery for all the evil elves out there (including mine!) \r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/87KAq.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat\\'s Changed:\r\nThe colors used are a \\\"dark steel\\\" (desaturated, black and burned highlights), white and red. There are some symbols on the scabbard (for the dagger & 1h sword), on the blade of the sword and on the belly of the armor. I love how this armor is adorned with feathers, so I tried to go with a red feather theme which I think looks pretty cool. \r\n\r\nObjective:\r\nI think this scheme does a good job of picking up the ambient light in the environment and making your character look a little more bold and iconic. The individual pieces also match nicely with steel, ebony and daedric armor types. \r\n\r\n**Using this texture repaint will change every character using elven armor or equipment in your game.**\r\n\r\nIncluded:\r\nGuilded Elven Armor\r\nElven Armor\r\nGloves\r\nBoots\r\nArrows/Quiver\r\n1h Sword\r\n2h Sword\r\n1h Axe\r\n2h Axe\r\nWarhammer\r\nDagger\r\n\r\nGood for male and female characters. \r\n\r\nI found the symbols I used as detail overlays from google image search, their copyrights belong to their respective owners. \r\n\r\nTree image (on the shield and belly) is inspired by a design created by \\\"Adoomer\\\"\r\nhttp://adoomer.deviantart.com/\r\n\r\nThe vector used on the 1h sword was used by following the tutorial found here: \r\nhttp://blog.youdesignit.com/2008/06/09/free-floral-designs-for-t-shirts/\r\n\r\nI created this armor recolor to teach myself how to do it, I don\\'t plan on supporting this mod.
