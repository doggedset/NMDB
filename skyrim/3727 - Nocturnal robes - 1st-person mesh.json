  "descriptionHtml": "[B]VERSION HISTORY:[/b]\r\n2.0 (17th of December, 2011) - Added support for field of view up to 110.\r\n1.0 (15th of December, 2011) - First public release. Compatible with kab\\'s \\\"Archmage Crafting\\\" mod.\r\n\r\n[B]ABOUT ME:[/B]\r\nThis is my first Elder Scrolls/Gamebryo-related mod release. I\\'m new to this engine, so please forgive any mistakes I might make.\r\n\r\n[B]DESCRIPTION:[/B]\r\nThis is an edit of the Nocturnal robes third-person mesh to remove glitches visible in first-person.\r\n\r\nNormally, if you replace the first-person mesh with the robes model and then look downwards, you\\'d see part of the robe mesh floating there. I removed that from view, and also adjusted the size of the sleeves to fix clipping for gloves like the Mystic Tuning Gloves.\r\n\r\nI don\\'t know if anyone else has already done this. I saw someone say that it couldn\\'t be done until the construction set is out, so I felt I had to try. After much trial and error, this is the result. It should suffice until a proper fix is made.\r\n\r\n[B]INSTALLATION:[/B]\r\nMain file:\r\nBy default, I\\'ve renamed the files to replace the female Archmage robes. All you need to do is rename them to whatever you\\'re replacing (eg. 1stpersoncuirass_0.nif) and put them next to the mesh you replaced (eg. data/meshes/armor/ebonymail/). Both _0 and _1 files are the same file.\r\n\r\nReference fix file:\r\nSimply extract the RAR to your Skyrim\\'s Data folder. It should place an ESP in the Data folder and the meshes at meshes/clothes/nocturnal/. You must then enable the ESP as with other ESP mods. You can do this either via the launcher or editing DLCList.txt in your Application Data\\\\Skyrim folder. If you are stuck, please look it up on the internet.\r\n\r\n[B]KNOWN ISSUES:[/B]\r\n- Gauntlets and the like will still clip through the sleeves, and I\\'ve no idea how to fix that other than modifying the mesh (which would look bad).\r\n- Parts of the mesh clip into the screen at high FOV during some actions, eg. using a bow.\r\n\r\n[B]CREDITS:[/B]\r\nOther mods visible in the screenshots:\r\n- Various hi-res texture mods (I\\'ve mixed so many that I don\\'t know which does what)\r\n- Modified FXAA and ENBSeries post-processing filters (based on settings by others)\r\n- Elegant Nocturnal robe textures (with modified colors)\r\n- Personally modified hand and fire textures\r\n- Immersive HUD\r\n- Centaur font\r\n\r\nTools used:\r\n- 3d Studio Max\r\n- Nifskope 1.1.1 (http://niftools.sourceforge.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=2683&) with https://github.com/throttlekitty/nifxml\r\n- Maxtools 3.7.1 (http://niftools.sourceforge.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=3196#p21708)\r\n- TESsnip (don\\'t know what version, I went through many)\r\n- Skyrim Viewer (http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/download/1055-skyrim-viewer/)\r\n\r\nGuides referred to:\r\n- Vannus\\' 3ds Max guide (http://www.thenexusforums.com/index.php?/topic/478312-tutorial-3ds-max-skinned-meshes-into-game/), although it didn\\'t work and I ended up doing something different.",
