Short stories, long series, histories, I have tried to add as many different varieties of books as I can.\r<br />\r<br />A library has been added south of Whiterun, near Honningbrew meadery. The Library caretaker, an old woman by the name of Losina, will also sell you books. A library in Solitude has been added. You will find it down some stairs to the left(your left when entering the temple) in the Temple of the Divines. Inside the library is an archives section which burrows deep into the mountainside next to Solitude. \r<br />\r<br />All the books will be kept lore-friendly, but those intended to incorporate &#39;actual&#39; events may elaborate on official Bethesda history which was vague or non-existent on that certain subject. Example: The Genealogy of Ulfric Stormcloak was made up pretty much entirely by me.\r<br />\r<br />All the books have been added to appropriate leveled lists so some of them should appear in containers or be sold by merchants from time to time. They have also been placed around the Skyrim world in numbers appropriate to their worth.\r<br />\r<br />Some of the books have unique cover textures and others also have images inserted in the pages. A small number of these are my work, but most I aquired from Google images.\r<br />\r<br />Books added: 40\r<br />\r<br />V 0.1\r<br />- The Adoring Fan\r<br />- To Survive a Battle\r<br />- Lasting Chase, Book I\r<br />- Dragon Wall&#39;s Song\r<br />- The Lie of Sovngarde\r<br />- 5 Books in Dwemer writing(Not really readable unless you understand ancient Dwemer but they are worth a bit of gold)\r<br />V 0.2\r<br />- Lasting Chase, Book II\r<br />- A History of Flames\r<br />- A Tale of Caution   - By SpotNL -\r<br />- Cithmak and Tharm\r<br />- Tolhard&#39;s Fragments\r<br />V 0.3\r<br />- Lasting Chase, Book III\r<br />- The Common Room\r<br />- Praise to Akatosh\r<br />- The Art of Silence\r<br />- Khaja Komedium(The work in this book was obtained from various places on the internet)\r<br />- The Poem of Lunai \r<br />- The Battle of Fastleg Gorge\r<br />- Genealogy of Ulfric Stormcloak\r<br />- Lasting Chase, Book IV\r<br />- The Old Troll&#39;s Hole\r<br />- Covenant of Journeys\r<br />- Studies on Village Life, v1\r<br />- The Marketplace\r<br />- Studies on Village Life, v2\r<br />- Trovyre&#39;s Venture\r<br />V 0.4\r<br />- Studies on Village Life, v3\r<br />- Lasting Chase, Book V\r<br />- Lasting Chase, Book VI\r<br />- Lasting Chase, Book VII\r<br />- A large amount of scrolls, notes, notebooks and other miscellaneous readable articles \r<br />  in the Solitude Library archives(These will count as 6 full length books).\r<br />\r<br />The NPCs added by this mod are simply to populate the libraries(except a few authors off on their own.) Unfortunately none of them have any quests or even dialogue to offer as I haven&#39;t the skills to properly add such things. Only the Book Merchants, Losina and Faisia, are of any use to you. I have added AI packages to a small number of vanilla NPCs to make them visit the libraries. I tried not to mess with their already present packages so they might not show up in the libraries very often. They are so far: Erikur, Freir, Pantea and Nazeem.\r<br />\r<br />NPCs added: 21\r<br />\r<br />V 0.1\r<br />- Drokus, Author\r<br />V 0.2\r<br />- Saminus, Author\r<br />- Losina, Book Merchant/Library Caretaker\r<br />- Damold, Library Guard\r<br />- Fuere Mastille, Reader\r<br />V 0.3\r<br />- Jumzzin Zezpitz, Author\r<br />- Hedredras, Author\r<br />V 0.4\r<br />- Darilk Snowcloud, Author\r<br />- Sembari Daieluo, Scholar/Library Caretaker\r<br />- Faisia Daieluo, Book Merchant/Library Caretaker\r<br />- Harnim, Scholar\r<br />- Kellar, Scholar\r<br />- Kolleg Marjoll, Library Guard\r<br />- Ralivin, Library Guard\r<br />- Melaran, Scholar\r<br />- Fermilda, Melaran&#39;s Bodyguard\r<br />- Strenom, Melaran&#39;s Bodyguard\r<br />- Desarius, Bibliophile\r<br />- Selisia, Book-Lover\r<br />- Laion, Bookworm\r<br />- Reauv Lamyuno, Literature Enthusiast\r<br />\r<br />Buildings added: 3\r<br />\r<br />V 0.2\r<br />- Whiterun Library\r<br />- Losina&#39;s House\r<br />V 0.4\r<br />- Solitude Library (note: there is a lot of stuff in this cell so you may experience some performance loss when inside)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/images/110/1773418-1330997435.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Automatic(with Nexus Mod Manager):\r<br />\r<br />1. Click on Download with Nexus Mod Manager. It should download the file into your NMM mod directory.\r<br />\r<br />2. Double click or press activate on the mod and it should be installed in your data directory.\r<br />\r<br />3. Play&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Manual:\r<br />\r<br />1. Extract the contents of the &#39;Stegdon&#39;s Book Collection&#39; archive into your data directory, which should be: Steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim/Data\r<br />\r<br />2. Using Data Files in the Skyrim startup menu, Nexus Mod Manager or similar activate the &#39;Stegdon&#39;s Book Collection&#39; .nif file.\r<br />\r<br />3. Play&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/images/110/1773418-1330997482.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />1. Using Nexus Mod Manager or Data Files in the Skyrim startup menu, deactivate the Stegdon&#39;s Book Collection .esp file.\r<br />\r<br />2. Alternatively you could just delete the .esp file in Steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim/Data.\r<br />\r<br />3. If you don&#39;t want any clutter files left then just delete the following:\r<br />\r<br />Steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim/Data/meshes/SBC\r<br />Steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim/Data/textures/SBC\r<br />Steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim/Data/SBC - Readme.txt\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/images/110/1773418-1330997530.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Version 0.4 - Added an equivelant ten books, and fourteen NPCs. Added a library to the Temple of the Divines in Solitude. Hopefully fixed the exterior navmeshes around the Whiterun Library. Fixed gray face bug for all NPCs.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Version 0.3 - Added fifteen more books, and two NPCs.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Version 0.2 - Added five more books to the already present ten. A library has been constructed outside of Whiterun with four NPCs inside, one of whom will sell you books.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Version 0.1 - Initial release\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/images/130/1773418-1330997694.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This mod requires nothing except TES V - Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/images/130/1773418-1330997733.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Quite a few cells(mostly interior) have had a book added to them. If these cells are completely changed by another mod then all you&#39;ll have is a missing book so it&#39;s no big deal. Any other mod that changes the Temple of the Divines interior cell, the Solitude Mountainside exterior cell, Broken Oar Grotto or around the Whiterun Library exterior might be incompatible.",
