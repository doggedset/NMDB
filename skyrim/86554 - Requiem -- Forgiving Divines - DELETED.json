  "summary": "In Requiem, the divines offer overpowered protection to their adherents. But not if you steal. This mod allows more stealing while retaining the &#34;unforgivable&#34; sins.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b][color=#1e84cc][size=4]What does this mod do?\r<br />[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />In the roleplaying overhaul mod [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281/?]Requiem[/url] the shrines offer buffs and protections based on which Divine you worship.\r<br />\r<br />However, there are a few ways to lose your blessing:\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]If you murder 1 person (permanent, unless painful regrets perk used)\r<br />[*]If you steal 10 things \r<br />[*]If you accrue a bounty (temporary)\r<br />[*]If you accrue a lifetime bounty (permanent)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />This makes playing a thief or joining the Thieves Guild a no-go, which locks out a lot of content for players who want to use the divines but also enjoy the fun aspect of thievery. Even joining the thieves guild, despite having a bounty of zero and a lifetime theft count of zero, results in immediate banishment from the Divines.\r<br />\r<br />We could debate all day about whether the Divines care about theft, but at the end of the day this mod allows you to roleplay that they don&#39;t. Perhaps you&#39;re playing a Robin Hood. Perhaps you&#39;re infiltrating the Thieves Guild to change it from the inside. Perhaps you&#39;re a thief because you have nowhere else to turn. So long as you don&#39;t commit an unforgivable sin, the Divines will look kindly on your penance.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4]What changes did you make?[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Generally speaking, the following rules apply to all Divine Blessings (Nocturnal excluded):\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]You can now accrue a bounty of 10,500 septims before losing your blessing\r<br />[*]You can now steal unlimited objects, unless you get caught and accrue a bounty above 10,500 septims\r<br />[*]You can now join the Thieves Guild without being punished by the Divines\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4]What did you leave alone?[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />A murder of any kind results in a permanent loss of your blessing (unless you follow the Painful Regrets perk). Dark Brotherhood membership and murder conditions have been left unchanged (killing Grelod the Kind doesn&#39;t count as a murder).\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4]Is this compatible with Behind the Curtain?[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />No. I began looking through it and I could edit the conditions to allow theft but ZeroMorph&#39;s mod is really a purist roleplaying overhaul that examines devotees of the Divines. I think if you want to enjoy the huge buffs that come with that mod you should force yourself to play by its rules.\r<br />\r<br />Or you could [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/85532/?]use this[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4]I want my blessings no matter what crimes I commit, even murder[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />No problem, download [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50251/?]this file[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4]What&#39;s my load order?[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim.esm\r<br />Update.esm\r<br />Dawnguard.esm\r<br />HearthFires.esm\r<br />Dragonborn.esm\r<br />Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch.esp\r<br />&lt;Your load order&gt;\r<br />Requiem.esp\r<br />Requiem - Bugsmasher Edition.esp\r<br />Requiem - Forgiving Divines.esp\r<br />Requiem for the Indifferent.esp\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=4]My other Requiem mods:[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/80701/?]Not So Deadly Traps[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83639/?]One With Nature Patch[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70416/?]Troll No Health Regeneration/Half Regeneration[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/84780/?]Vendors sell Bestial Stew and Elsweyr Fondue[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83771/?]Immersive Jewelry Patch[/url]",
