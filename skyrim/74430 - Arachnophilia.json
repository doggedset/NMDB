  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ff00ff][size=6][center]ARACHNOPHILIA[/center][/size][/color][center][color=#ffe599][size=3][b]v0.2a&#33;\r<br />[/b][/size][/color][color=#f4cccc][size=2][b]Now with Hemotoxin&#33;[/b][/size][/color][/center]\r<br />[center][/center]\r<br />[b][color=#00ffff][size=4]BREAKDOWN[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />[size=3]As I have posted this mod to the Nexus while it is still under development, there are a few things to note about this list.  Not all of the items you will find here will necessarily be implemented at the time of the reading, those that are may not be fully working, and any or all of them are subject to change or revision as time goes on.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff][size=3][b][SPIDER SIZES][/b][/size][/color]\r<br />[size=3]There should be some meaningful differences between the different sizes of spider beyond just &#39;bigger is badder&#39;.  And in the insect world, that sentiment is often far from true.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ffff00][size=3]Small Spiders[/size][/color][/b][size=3]:  In fact, in the case of many insects, they smaller they are, the nastier they are.  I believe this would be very true of Frostbite Spiders in Skyrim.  Their prey being wolves, deer, etc... smaller spiders are much more likely to have &#39;strike and run&#39; tactics which rely on incredibly potent venom to disable and kill their prey before consuming them.  With that in mind, the Small Spiders will have the following attributes:[/size]\r<br />[size=3]-Most potent Venom[/size]\r<br />[size=3]-Much smaller than Vanilla[/size]\r<br />[size=3]-Much faster than Vanilla[/size]\r<br />[size=3]-Prefer bite attacks\r<br />-Terrifying.  If an NPC falls below 20% health, they will flee in terror until healed[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ffff00][size=3]Large Spiders[/size][/color][/b][size=3]:  Out in the wild, the player will be far more likely to encounter Small and Large Spiders than Giant ones.  They should be more immediately deadly than the small spiders without feeling like mini-bosses (which should be reserved for the rare Giant Spiders).  Considering their size, the Large Spiders would be very capable of pursuing and bullying most of their smaller prey to death, and would need some fancy tricks beyond just a disabling venom to take on the larger creatures of Skyrim.  The following attributes will be given to Large Spiders:[/size]\r<br />[size=3]-Stamina and Defense-Sapping Venom[/size]\r<br />[size=3]-[/size][color=#ea9999][size=1](WIP)[/size][/color][size=3]Caustic Spray[/size]\r<br />[size=3]-[/size][color=#ea9999][size=1](WIP)[/size][/color][size=3]Small degree of Natural Armor[/size]\r<br />[size=3]-Slightly smaller than Vanilla[/size]\r<br />[size=3]-Much faster than Vanilla[/size]\r<br />[size=3]-Must accelerate to top speed[/size]\r<br />[size=3]-Some attacks stagger[/size]\r<br />[size=3]-[/size][size=3]Some attacks made by blood-caked pedipalps have disease chance\r<br />-Terrifying.  If an NPC falls below 20% health, they will flee in terror until healed\r<br />[/size][b]-[/b][size=3]Monstrous.  Lunge attacks have a chance of tackling NPC&#39;s to the ground, panicking them for a very short time[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ffff00][size=3]Giant Spiders[/size][/color][/b][size=3]:  It goes without saying that Giant Spiders should be truly terrifying.  The Giant Spider is a staple monster in countless stories and movies throughout the ages, and crossing one in Skyrim should fill the player with a true sense of dread.  The size and strength of a Giant Frostbite Spider are its greatest advantages, and it will use them to knock enemies off their feet and pummel them to death.[/size]\r<br />[size=3]-Health-sapping Venom[/size]\r<br />[size=3]-[/size][color=#ea9999][size=1](WIP)[/size][/color][size=3]Natural Armor[/size]\r<br />[size=3]-[/size][size=3]Immune to Knockdown[/size]\r<br />[size=3]-Much faster than Vanilla[/size]\r<br />[size=3]-Slow acceleration to top speed[/size][size=3]\r<br />[/size]-[size=3]Some attacks made by blood-caked pedipalps have disease chance[/size]\r<br />[size=3]-Attacks Stagger[/size]\r<br />[size=3]-Some attacks cause Knockdown[/size]\r<br />[size=3]-Large physical damage of attacks\r<br />-Terrifying.  If an NPC falls below 20% health, they will flee in terror until healed\r<br />-Monstrous.  Lunge attacks will always tackle the player and NPC&#39;s to the ground.  Tackled NPC&#39;s will panic for a short time\r<br />-Vicious.  Under the right conditions, NPC&#39;s can become overwhelmed, causing them to retreat for a short time[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff][size=4][b][SPIDER BITES][/b][/size][/color]\r<br />[size=3]Spider Bites are now able to be blocked without ill effects.  However, Spider Venom is now [b][color=#ff7700]HIGHLY DISABLING[/color][/b].  The effects of a spider bite range from [b][color=#ff7700]Damage to Max Health/Stamina/Magicka[/color][/b] to [color=#ff7700][b]Decreasing Stats[/b][/color].  Venom effects on the player will [b][color=#ff7700]LAST UNTIL HEALED[/color][/b] by a [b][color=#b6d7a8]Potion of Cure Poison[/color][/b].  Venom effects on NPC&#39;s will last for 1 hour.  This means that if Lydia took a few too many bites from that last encounter, you&#39;d better take her back to Breezehome for some bed rest.  Keep in mind, in the vanilla game, only town [color=#b6d7a8][b]Apothecaries[/b][/color] will carry these potions and their effects cannot be gained through ingredients or Alchemy.  [b][color=#ff7700]I HAVE NOT CHANGED THIS[/color][/b].  In the future, I will add recipes for crafting Antivenin.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=3]In addition to the new Venom, bite attacks now deal significantly increased damage.  With fangs the size of a grown man&#39;s forearm, you can bet that bite is going to hurt.\r<br />[/size] [size=3]\r<br /> \r<br

/>[b][color=#00ffff][size=4][[b][color=#00ffff][size=4]WHAT&#39;S BUGGIN&#39; ME[/size][/color][/b]][/size][/color][/b]\r<br />[size=3]What&#39;s currently on my mind, some future plans and present concerns...[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ff7700]Cure Poison Potions[/color][/b][size=3]:  You can&#39;t make them yourself, you don&#39;t find them in loot, and you can only buy them from one type of shop.  There are pros and cons to this.  I do like the idea that you have to actually go into town to &#34;gear up&#34; before an adventure.. the little routine gives you time to think about your upcoming expedition, get excited about it, make some plans.  It reminds me of that grocery store pit stop while starting out on a small vacation.  Unfortunately, potions only being available in town also means that one must be an upstanding, law abiding citizen to obtain them.  Also, some dungeons are [/size][i]really[/i][size=3] out of the way.  So, while I won&#39;t mess around with Cure Potion Potions, what I do think I will do is to create a new recipe for Frostbite Venom.  Removing the 15 Minute Death Timer opens up some fun options for dealing with spider bites.  My current thought is the creation of an Antivenin which can be brewed using Frostbite Venom.  With the right choices on my end, this will hopefully open up some new and interesting ways role-play your character.  Also, it means that if you find yourself far from civilization, you&#39;ll still have access to a cure... albeit a risky one.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ff7700]Spider Factions and Relationships[/color][/b][size=3]:  This is nowhere near the top of my list.  But it [/size][i]is[/i][size=3] on the list.  I know that there are a bunch of mods which already alter enemy Factions and Relationships, and I worry how well this will play with a heavy mod list.  I also know that I have made Spiders very strong, and I don&#39;t want them to bring about a mass extinction after a few in-game days.  But *really* do hate watching them get all bromantic with creatures which should actually be their prey.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][b]Imagespace Modifiers and the Active Effects tab[/b][/color][size=3]:  Are they good?  Are they bad?  Are they useful?  Are they annoying?  It&#39;s all just too subjective.  Ideally I&#39;d like to create a [/size][i]very [/i][size=3]subtle Imagespace Modifier to kick in when suffering the effects of Venom and remove all of the effect displays from the Active Effects tab.  That tab is better used to keep track of other mod effects and, really, the venom is something you&#39;re going to want to cure asap anyway.  Plus, stackable effects cause menu spam, and nobody wants to have a huge chunk of their Active Effects tab taken up by spam.  Similarly, I imagine that Imagespace Modifiers are something that can really get on someone&#39;s nerves who&#39;s sensitive to that sort of thing.  DOF effects, for example, always give me a headache, no matter how subtle.  Will have to think on this.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#00ffff][size=4][NOTES]\r<br />[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=3][b]No, this isn&#39;t &#34;That kind&#34; of mod[/b][/size][/color][size=3]:  Seriously, people, there&#39;s more than one use of the suffix -philia.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][b]Balanced, not stupid[/b][/color]:  Spiders will not have 1000 hp, cast magickal spells, or have dialogue.  They are fearsome animals for sure, but no more than that (with the exception of 1 or 2 individuals).\r<br />\r<br />[/size][color=#ffff00][size=3][b]Simple and Lore Friendly[/b][/size][/color][size=3]: [/size][b][size=2][color=#ea9999](This might change, if the need arises)[/color] [/size][/b][size=3]This means that I will not be adding new spider races, designs, locations, spells, etc.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ffff00][size=3]Highly compatible[/size][/color][/b][size=3]: [/size][color=#ea9999][size=2][b](This might change, if the need arises)[/b][/size][/color][size=3] I will not be placing any new spiders into the world or altering spawn points in any way.  My goal is, above all else, compatibility and simplicity.  This is also why I am making changes as deep as I can, altering vanilla spells and effects wherever I can.  That being said, I&#39;m sure I will still eventually run into issues of compatibility, but they should in no way be game breaking.  Once the mod is complete, patches will begin to roll in as necessary.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ffff00][size=3]Easy to understand[/size][/color][/b][size=3]:  Again, I don&#39;t want the fun of spider fights to be ruined by complex rules and weird magical effects.  It&#39;s simple.  Spiders are big, scary, and vicious.  If they are given the opportunity to bite you, you will suffer.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ffff00][size=3]Difficult[/size][/color][/b][size=3]:  Spiders are going to be a real threat now.  I can&#39;t take into account all of the other mods that are out there, but at least for those of us who have not modded our Dovahkiin into indestructible demigods and enjoy a good challenge, this mod should deliver some fun, fast-paced, high risk action.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ffff00][size=3]Intuitive, thematic[/size][/color][/b][size=3]:  Exoskeletons exist because they work- spiders will have some natural armor.  Venom is not a magic spell- it is slow to work, but can be fatal if left untreated.  Frostbite spiders are huge and very strong- they will bully around your character if you let them.  You get the idea.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#00ffff][size=4][FAQ][/size][/color][/b]\r<br />[size=3]WIP.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[b][color=#ff7700][size=4][WARNING][/size][/color][/b]\r<br
