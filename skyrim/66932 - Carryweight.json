  "summary": "Extra carryweight with stamina when levelling, and no delay for stamina regen.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Instead of gaining 5 carryweight when you choose Stamina when you level up, this mod gives 100 carryweight every time you choose Stamina. Also, there is normally a 5 second delay after running out of stamina beforeÂ  stamina begins to regenerate - this mod removes that delay.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;*** DISCLAIMER - I made this for myself and decided to share. I will not alter this in any way to suit someone else. If you don&#39;t like it, \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;don&#39;t subscribe; or better yet, make your own ***",
