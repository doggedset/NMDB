  "descriptionHtml": "Dawnguard DLC required \r<br />\r<br />I know, some people have a hard time if they start playing Dawnguard. What should I do, Become a vampire lord, and do nothing with the faction Dawnguard? Or, should I stay werewolf, and join the Dawnguard? Or, I want to become a vampire lord, but I&#39;m a werewolf&#33; This mod gives the solution&#33; \r<br />\r<br />You can find an amulet and a ring near Gjukar&#39;s Monument. The ring gives the power to become a vampire lord, when you equip the ring, if you unequip the ring, the vampire lord lesser power will be removed, but all the other vampire powers, can still be used. The amulet gives the power to become a werewolf when you equip it. But when you unequip the amulet, the power will be removed. All the other effects will still be active. You can wear them both on the same time.\r<br />\r<br />I have also a steam account, and I place also mods on the steam workshop for skyrim. My username is Dovakhiin.",
