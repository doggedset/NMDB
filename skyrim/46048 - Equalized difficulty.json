  "descriptionHtml": "Hello &#33;\r<br />I always thought that Bethesda&#39;s level of difficulty were quite bad. Where is the fun if you can deal 3x more damage than the NPC do ? Or if the NPC is 4x stronger than you ?\r<br />So with this mod, you and your ennemies are equal. If you deal 100% damages (novice), npc deals 100% damages. Same thing for any level of difficulty :\r<br />Apprentice is 200%/200%\r<br />Adept is 300%/300%\r<br />...\r<br />Legendary is 600%/600%\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This mod does NOT change any NPC AI, so i recommend you use others mod to make NPC more clever and reactive.\r<br />\r<br />Don&#39;t forget to endorse if you enjoyed this file.
