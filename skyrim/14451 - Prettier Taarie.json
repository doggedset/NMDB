  "descriptionHtml": "Hi there!\r\n\r\nThis mod improves the look of the NPC \\\"Taarie\\\", who is found at Radiant Raiment in Solitude.\r\n\r\nI improved her looks because my high elf character wanted to marry another high elf. Unfortunately Taarie was the only choice and her default appearance isn\\'t too appealing to me, so I made this mod to improve her looks to my taste.\r\n\r\nI have decided to share the mod with Nexus in case anyone else shared my sentiments.\r\n\r\nTo install, extract everything to your skyrim\\\\data\\\\ folder, and using your mod manager of choice, check the taarie.esp file. I recommend you place it at the bottom to avoid other mods possibly overwriting it.\r\n\r\nFeel free to use it as a basis for your own Taarie mod.\r\n\r\nThank you for downloading. I hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\n-sumpwa\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nBethesda: Skyrim and Creation Kit\r\nValve: Steam\r\n",
