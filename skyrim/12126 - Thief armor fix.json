  "summary": "Makes it so you can loot the thief armor found on the bodies of the thief random encounter.",
  "descriptionHtml": "In addition to adjusting it so you can loot an equip the armor worn by thief this mod also makes it possible to loot the Amulet of Articulation worn by Brynjolf. Stealing the amulet from Brynjolf or changing the game so you can kill him will get you the amulet but it appears that the amulet will be purely a vanity item as it has no enchantments (I kinda like that it is just a vanity item). This means you have a really cool amulet that you should be able to enchant.\r\n\r\nTo install this simply put the files in your skyrim data folder.",
