  "summary": "Enemies search for you longer. Hide well.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u]DESCRIPTION:\r<br />[/u][/b]\r<br />This little mod does nothing more than increase the amount of time before enemy stops looking for you after you expose yourself (up to [b]30[/b] seconds) and/or attack an enemy (up to [b]90[/b] seconds). \r<br /> \r<br />[i]Why? [/i]\r<br />Because it is more fun for you and natural for enemies to look for a possible threat longer. \r<br />I did thorough research on existing sneak mechanic modifications by trying all of them on my heavily modded Skyrim. \r<br />I use plenty of combat-oriented mods so, to add more &#34;realism&#34; feeling to game overall I needed just that, a longer &#34;intruder alert&#34; timer. And all of existing sneak mods are too complex for this simple task, they add too many non-vanilla, often strange mechanics and modify too many variables. \r<br />So I got to learn a little myself and make this. \r<br />SATT can be used in conjunction with combat mods or just to increase immersion of vanilla experience.\r<br />\r<br />============================================================================================ \r<br />[b]\r<br />[u]COMPATIBILITY:\r<br />[/u][/b]\r<br />Compatible with any mod except the ones that modify the same values (e.g. Duel - Combat Realism).\r<br />\r<br />============================================================================================ \r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Mods that compliment SATT well:\r<br />\r<br />[/u][/b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18436/?]ASIS[/url] by The ASIS Team - to make perks, spells and potions available to your enemies;\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/5485/?]Deadly Combat[/url] by Borgut1337 - to make fights more brutal, fast and yeah, DEADLY (complete with full MCM config menu);\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10037/?]ACE - Combat Skills[/url] by Athyra (I use Realistic Fighting module only) - to make circumstances of a fight matter;\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27866/?]High Level Enemies[/url] by Dalquist - (I prefer Hardcore version) - to make end-game enemies uhm.. exist;\r<br />\r<br />[i][b][u]PS:[/u][/b] As a side note, the reduced enemy cone of vision which is implemented in many other sneak mods is unrealistic at very least (on the contrary to what these mods suggest). In-game npc cone of vision is at approximately 190 degrees and that is as realistic as it can be, it&#39;s usual human cone of vision value.[/i]",
