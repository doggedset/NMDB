  "descriptionHtml": "This mod removes the camera sway from attacking and equipping in 1st person view. The swaying from power attacks is still there since I think it\\'s not over the top like the one from normal attacks and equipping.\r\n\r\nHere\\'s a vid of what it looks like : \r\n[youtube]xAsfy1GwwBI[/youtube]\r\n\r\nSince each animation = 1 file, this mod is easily customizable. If you want to keep the sway from a specific animation, just remove the file corresponding to that animation in the folder : Data\\\\Meshes\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\_1stperson\\\\animations.\r\n\r\nTo uninstall, simply remove every file from the folder : Data\\\\Meshes\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\_1stperson\\\\animations",
