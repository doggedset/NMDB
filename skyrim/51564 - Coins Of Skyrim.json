[Description][/color]\r<br />Dynamically Changes the way you make money in skyrim for both killing enemies and quests (Quests give the same ammount of gold but they are in 4 different coin values)\r<br />\r<br />If you want to sell the coins at the exact value they are supposed to be and you have version 1.0 Beta or later then go to your spells in the restoration section and equip and use the &#34;Mod Speechcraft&#34; spell. This temporaraly makes prices 525% better for 60 seconds so the coin values are exact like they are supposed to without affecting your speechcraft level.\r<br />\r<br />Coin Values:\r<br />Ebony Coin: \r<br />   Value: 10 Septims Weight: 0.04\r<br />\r<br />Gold Coin: \r<br />   Value: 5 Septims Weight: 0.03\r<br />\r<br />Silver Coin:\r<br />   Value: 3 Septims Weight: 0.02\r<br />\r<br />Bronze Coin: \r<br />   Value: 1 Septim Weight: 0.01\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />*NOTE: Higher-Res Coins will be added once I get Permission from the author to use his textures*\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange]2. [Features][/color]\r<br />Dynamic Enemy Coin System\r<br />What Is it?:\r<br />\r<br />Well the Dynamic Coin System for Enemies is Regular and Boss Enemies have a random yield of total value of the Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Ebony Coins. You could get no coins or could get Total Coin Value worth 2000+ for one enemy just depends as its random.\r<br />\r<br />*Dragons can yield up to 2x the total coin value the other enemies but it still stands as you can get None or little value of coins its still random like the normal enemies.*\r<br />\r<br />- Renames the &#34;Gold&#34; to &#34;Gold Septim&#34;\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange]3. [Installation][/color]\r<br />Use NexusModManager for easy installation.\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange]4. [Uninstallation][/color]\r<br />Use NexusModManager\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange]5. [Q&A][/color]\r<br />Q: Where do I Turn the coins to Gold Septims (Spendable Money)?\r<br />A: Well you can generally sell them to any merchant that sells MISC items and if you have the merchants addon you can sell them to a follower &#34;Vorbi the Huntress&#34; which she is located in Whiterun market (Walking around most likely)\r<br />\r<br />Q: The coin values aren&#39;t like their supposed to be?\r<br />A: I came across this too. As of COS version 1.0 Beta its been fixed. All you have to do is go to your spells and go to the restoration section and equip &#34;Mod Speechcraft&#34; spell. What this spell does is temporararaly makes it where the values of the coins are exact for 60 seconds. If you wanna Sell the coins use this spell first.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange]6.
