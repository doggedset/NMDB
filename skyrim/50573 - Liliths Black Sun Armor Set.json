This time the mod includes full set of armor (and hoods) for both genders and all races&#33; \r<br />Even though I though I&#39;d never make an armor retexture for a vanilla mesh ever again, I&#39;m quite glad I did it anyway. The male armor is quality-wise a little better than the female one as the UV-mapping on the female one is fairly bad but hopefully the difference is quite small in the end. I hope you enjoy using these :)\r<br />\r<br />The plugin file has been made from the lilith&#39;s armor-mod&#39;s plugin file, meaning all the stats and crafting requirements are still the same. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Stats and crafting:\r<br />\r<br />All the stats of the armor pieces are two points above daedric armor and are crafted with daedric smithing at any forge. The chestpiece for example requires 2 daedra hearts / 3 ebony ingots / ebony plate armor.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />or use the console\r<br />\r<br />1: type &#34;help lilith&#34; into the console\r<br />\r<br />2: it gives you the IDs (page up / down for scrolling the list)\r<br />\r<br />3. type &#34;player.additem *id* *amount* &#34; without the * and &#34; (for example: player.additem 08000d69 1)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />- - - - - -\r<br />NMM or manually:\r<br />\r<br />1. Dump the bsa-file and the esp-file inside the data folder into the skyrim&#39;s data folder. / or use the mod manager. it should work.\r<br />\r<br />2. check the .esp file and you&#39;re ready to go\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallion:\r<br />- - - - - - - - -\r<br />\r<br />Just remove the files you added.
