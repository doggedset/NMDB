This mod is a 4K retexture of the Dragonbone Armor set.\r<br /> \r<br />Location\r<br /> ========\r<br /> \r<br /> ---\r<br /> \r<br />Details\r<br /> =======\r<br /> \r<br /> This mod is a complete overhaul of the Dragonbone armor textures and normal maps. Like many of you, I use Cabal120&#39;s excellent retextures of 90%~ of the armors in the game. Unfortunately there were several on the list that were never overhauled (or at least publically released). This mod is aimed at filling in one of those holes. I took the files from the high resolution DLC package and upscaled all of the relevent textures to 4K HD. I then reworked all of the textures from the ground up using Photoshop and several other programs. The original Dragonbone armor used very desaturated colors and low resolution files which contributed to the armors washed out and grainy appearance. Four years ago and on consoles this might have been acceptable but this is PC and we can handle more. Now all four parts of the armor set including the shield are in 4K 4096^2 (some of the hi res DLC files were only in 1k res if you can believe it). The textures should now have more saturated colors and a higher overall level of detail. I have also added some new features to the maps such ambient occlusion (dirt mapping) and specular maps to give the texture an extra level of polish.\r<br /> \r<br /> This retexture mod applies to both the male and female versions of the armor and their ingame objects.\r<br /> \r<br /> While the quality of the retexture may or may not be on the same level of Cabal120&#39;s standard it is my hope that you will enjoy using it in your game as much as I enjoyed making it. I had a lot of fun working on this set these past few days and I am thinking about doing some more retextures in the future.\r<br /> \r<br /> With the release of version 1.1 the weapon set is now retextured under a seperate download file. This is because it requires dawnguard in order to work and there is no point in combining it into the main download if that is the case.\r<br />Install\r<br /> =======\r<br />Either throw the folders into your Data directory or use the Nexus Mod Manager/Mod Organizer to do it for you.\r<br />Uninstall\r<br /> =========\r<br /> Either use Nexus Mod Manager or Mod Organizer to remove the files for you or manually remove them from you Skyrim/Data folder. \r<br />Upgrade\r<br /> =======\r<br /> \r<br /> I plan to upgrade and improve this mod over time as I fix bugs, think of new ideas, become more adapted to the CK, and so on. Be sure to check back in once and awhile for updates. Be sure to completely uninstall any previous versions of this mod before upgrading though.\r<br /> \r<br /> I will not take responsibility for corrupted save games or lost save games. Get into the habit of backing up your saves to protect your game data. Ignore at your own risk&#33;\r<br />Incompatibility\r<br /> ===============\r<br /> This mod will be incompatible with any other Dragonbone retexture mods or recolors of the Dragonbone armor. This includes the Dragonbone Ebonsteel Armor retexture.\r<br /> \r<br />Known Issues or Bugs\r<br /> ====================\r<br /> \r<br /> There are no known issues at this time \r<br /> \r<br />History\r<br /> =======\r<br /> \r<br /> 10/19/2015- Version 1.1 \r<br />-Updated armor set visuals. Should be dirtier and more to my tastes. \r<br />-Updated and corrected texture maps. Normal maps are now all dtx5 interpolated alpha.\r<br />-Added Dragonbone Weapon set retexture as a seperate download for those who want it. \r<br />-Updated readme to reflect changes.\r<br /> 8/21/2015 - Version 1.0 Initial Release \r<br /> \r<br />Contact\r<br /> =======\r<br /> You can find me on the Nexus Forums here as Natterforme.\r<br /> \r<br />Credits\r<br /> =======\r<br /> \r<br /> Thanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r<br /> Thanks to SkyrimNexus.com for the a one-stop-shop resource for authors and players.\r<br /> Thanks to LHammonds for the Readme Generator this file was based on.\r<br /> Thanks to all of you who have encouraged me and have supported me since I first put up screenshots of my work back in December 2011 and January 2012.\r<br /> I thank you all for your patience with me^^.\r<br /> Thanks to God for creating us all.
