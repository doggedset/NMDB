  "descriptionHtml": "--Did you ever think that the Forsworn weapons were just too weak to use? Or that the armor simply didn\\'t protect you enough? If the answer is yes, then this mod is for you.\r\n\r\n--Intro--\r\nThis is the second mod that I\\'ve made. I thought the Forsworn weapons and armor you got in the game weren\\'t strong enough to even go through a camp of med-level bandits. So all I did was make a set of Forsworn weapons and armor that have Daedric stats. (Might be a little overpowered on lower difficulties)\r\n\r\n--Location--\r\nThe set is located at Fort Sungard. \r\nThe key to the room with the set in it, is in a barrel at Karthspire Camp.\r\nThe room is a small tower on the East side of the fort.\r\nSee screen shots for more detail.\r\n\r\n--Installation--\r\n1. Download the file\r\n2. Extract the esp into your Skyrim Data folder\r\n(Folder location default: C/Program Files (x86)/Steam/SteamApps/common/skyrim/Data)\r\nOr use NMM.\r\n\r\n--If the mod doesn\\'t work, check your data files from the Skyrim Launcher and make sure that ForswornRevampedItems.esp is checked. \r\n\r\n--Feel free to leave comments, suggestions, or requests",
