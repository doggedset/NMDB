  "descriptionHtml": "Icey Cave Mod V 1.0\r\n\r\n/What is it?\r\nCurrently a single (very small) dungeon with a couple of bandits in it. Nothing special, and, if we\\'re being honest, somewhat lacking.\r\n\r\n/Where is it?\r\nOn the coast near Dawnstar. The reason why the esp is called aaamod1 is so you can type \\'coc aaamod1\\' and go straight there. As if you were wondering.\r\n\r\n/Disclaimer:\r\nProvided as is -I can\\'t concieve of how this might break anything, but please don\\'t blame me if it does.\r\n\r\n/Rights:\r\nDo whatever the hell you like with it. You can even pass it off as your own if that floats your boat. This represents about a day\\'s work of learning and tweaking. I\\'d never used the editor before making this, so you might want to reconsider the whole passing it off as your handiwork thing.\r\n\r\n/Feedback:\r\nSure. Be nice. Why you gotta be so critical all the time anyway? Jeez.\r\n\r\n-Metalfish",
