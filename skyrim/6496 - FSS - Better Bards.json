  "descriptionHtml": "Version 1.0\r\n\r\nFSS - Better Bards\r\n\r\nWelcome to better bards.  This mod combined with my other mod (included) \\\"FSS - No pause between lines\\\" will have your bards singing smoothly at last. \r\n\r\nWhat is \\\"Better Bards\\\"?\r\n\r\nThis is a collection of edits to the sound files for all the songs the bards sing.  As such its a simple replacer.\r\n\r\n[youtube]zvlZsNMee-g[/youtube]\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nCopy the sound folder from this archive into your Skyrim\\\\Data directory\r\n\r\nOptional But HIGHLY Recommended:\r\n\r\nThe Optional folder contains two .esp files, put ONE (1) into your Skyrim\\\\Data folder and enable it in the launcher.  By default Skyrim FORCES A DELAY BETWEEN LINES of 0.5 seconds.  The \\\"No pause\\\" version reduces it to 0.  The \\\"Slight pause\\\" version reduces it to 0.1 seconds.  This delay is a global variable in the game itself and has nothing to do with the sound files.\r\n\r\nPlease note!  The optional files WILL AFFECT ALL OTHER DIALOGUE!\r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t like Better Bards, but would like the No/Slight pause mod you can grab it seperate at http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6333\r\n\r\nUninstallation:\r\n\r\nWhy arn\\'t you using a mod manager?\r\n\r\nDelete the following folders and hope it doesn\\'t screw up any other mods:\r\nSkyrim/Data/sounds/voice/Skyrim.esm/femaleyoungeager\r\nSkyrim/Data/sounds/voice/Skyrim.esm/femaleeventoned\r\nSkyrim/Data/sounds/voice/Skyrim.esm/malenord\r\nSkyrim/Data/sounds/voice/Skyrim.esm/maleyoungeager",
