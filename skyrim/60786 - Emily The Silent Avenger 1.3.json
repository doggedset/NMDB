  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-57nxIT3GJug/VI64SVoxrrI/AAAAAAAADcA/6_18-4UB-F4/s1600/EMIL66676Y.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]There&#39;s a mock up version of Emily called : Astrid. Please do not download it. I DID NOT GIVE ANY PERMISSION TO THIS PERSON.\r<br />HE WAS AWARE OF HIS ACTION, YET STILL DECIDED TO IGNORE MY WARNING AND UPLOADED IT.\r<br />If you want to know the full detail of what happened with solid evidences, please open the spoiler.\r<br />[/color]Also this is kinda a long rant.\r<br />[spoiler]\r<br />Links are the proofs, please have a look at them as you read.\r<br />Also please keep in mind that following images of Emily you will see in this pictures are not the follower itself, but a player character. The preset of the pc is directly copied from the follower version using Racemenu 3, which means they look exactly the same.\r<br />without further ado, this is what happened.\r<br /> \r<br /> SkyrimGTX made a post about his upcoming follower, [color=#ff0000]Astrid [/color]which looks extremely similar to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60786/?]my folllower[/url], [url=http://i.imgur.com/I0SP5dP.jpg]Emily[/url].\r<br />Just by looking at it, I knew it was definitely copied from my follower using Racemenu 3, so I made a comment about it. I said &#34;WTF, you just copied from me.&#34; I was shocked by the fact that a person I helped a long time ago copied my work right in front of me without even letting me know. I wouldn&#39;t mind people using my works, but there are difference between when people enjoy your work and be thankful, and when someone takes your work and use it to make their own mod without asking for permission, especially [color=#e69138]when they make the exactly same thing and claim it as their own.[/color] \r<br /> \r<br /> He told me he didn&#39;t know about my character, and the preset was given by an user : Airin.\r<br /> It&#39;s pretty obvious that he was lying. He has been endorsing images of Emily I uploaded for numerous times. This means that EVEN IF he really didn&#39;t know that preset was my work, he knew how my character look like. Yet he still decided to make a follower with [url=http://i.imgur.com/xmsxcBc.jpg]same hairstyle[/url](Babydoll from KS Hairdos), [url=http://i.imgur.com/U69yWfp.png]same eyes[/url](Eyes of beauty), and [url=http://i.imgur.com/NvHmpuB.png]same skin textures[/url](Porcelain Pale Vampire) with my preset. Also the user Airin claims that he or she didn&#39;t copy from me. I can&#39;t hardly believe this is true because what the user claims to be his own preset has the exactly [url=http://i.imgur.com/ZETx525.jpg]the same small nose[/url], [url=http://i.imgur.com/e4bOFco.jpg]the same eyes[/url], and [url=http://i.imgur.com/g0k3LsC.jpg]the open mouth[/url]. The few differences here is the makeup(Mine&#39;s wearing darker lip gloss with less eyeliners), brows, and few adjustment on Astrid. \r<br /> \r<br /> Let&#39;s talk about the eyes. When I and 윈느앙상블 were making the preset for Emily, we made a mistake in her eyes. When you look at her eyes closely, you can see that there are [url=http://i.imgur.com/ne91us0.jpg]clipping issues between the skin and eyes[/url]. This was a mistake done with playing around with [url=http://static-4.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/12951-1-1381422770.jpg]VertexEdit [/url]featured in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12951/?]Enhanced Character Edit[/url]. This was [url=http://i.imgur.com/kfivxDG.jpg]also shown in Astrid[/url]. At this point it&#39;s clear that Astrid, which is based on Airin preset, is indeed based on mine since Airin copied the preset from mine.\r<br />\r<br /> If those evidences are not convincing enough, let me know so I can provide you more. \r<br />\r<br /> When I confronted SkyrimGTX about this on [url=http://i.imgur.com/vJRrjat.jpg]his video about the mock-up follower on his Youtube channel[/url], he wasn&#39;t able to come up with any type of counterarguments, excuses, or explanations, but just pure amateur and rude insults, Then he blocked me and came to my channel to verbally harass. He also said just [url=http://i.imgur.com/2jeZgQe.jpg]because both characters have the same hairstyle doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the same[/url]. Kinda funny because right after saying this, [url=http://i.imgur.com/r3DRxiB.jpg]he told me it&#39;s my fault for his action[/url] because I taught people how to copy preset with the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61436/?]video I created[/url]. Ths means that he already knew the preset was copied from Emily. Why else would he be mentioning about the video that I haven&#39;t even brought up? Whether Airin learned how to copy preset from my video or not is unclear too.\r<br />\r<br /> What&#39;s more sad is that this came from a person I helped a lot. He was asking me to create a follower version of his preset, Hikari and upload it on the nexus. I took his requests, spent my own time to make her, and now this is what I get for helping him. I should&#39;ve known better because this person has been banned numerous times on Nexus.\r<br />\r<br />People like SkyrimGTX are the reason why so many good modders stop contributing their works. Not only that they also make players/users leave from the community. He must face the consequence of his action therefore not only this community but the entire Bethesda community can be a better place.\r<br />\r<br /> Thank you reading, \r<br />\r<br />[/spoiler]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode] She may look fragile, but Emily is highly skilled assassin who utilizes in combat magics and one-handed swords. \r<br />After the mysterious death of her mother, she began her journey to find the truth behind it. \r<br />\r<br />*clothes not included, download it [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60195/?]here \r<br />[/url]Someone requested me to create this follower :)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Her own home added, go visit her&#33; :)\r<br />The viewpoint is a plus.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://skyrim.jpn.org/images/661/66169.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://skyrim.jpn.org/images/661/66170.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fBB1oppGYD8/VI6wJH2I7MI/AAAAAAAADaY/vX6FOCMigSY/s1600/Profile.png[/img]\r<br />Name : Emily Reese\r<br />Sex : Female\r<br />Date of Birth : Hearthfire 12th, 4E 182\r<br />Birthplace : Unknown\r<br />Height : 162cm (5&#39;3&#34;)\r<br />Weight : 42kg (92.5 lb)\r<br />Eye Color : Blue\r<br />Hair Color : Bright Blonde\r<br />Personality : Outgoing, delicate\r<br />Birth sign : The Serpent\r<br />Learned Skills : One handed weapon, Destruction magic\r<br />Learned Magics : Spark\r<br />Likes : Her sister\r<br />Dislikes : Her stepfather\r<br />[color=#d5a6bd]Location : Fallen Tree Bridge[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-arhy1-aieoo/VI6wJSkq1_I/AAAAAAAADac/q6VRlZsXiDo/s1600/Videos.png[/img]\r<br />[youtube]MLRgLn1nNYo[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]s8sRFwoahAE[/youtube]\r<br />[youtube]iH2cYaU9VaE[/youtube]\r<br />[img]http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8nJRsvj6Aew/VI6wLkccgjI/AAAAAAAADa4/XGbw-BA5GNo/s1600/stats.png[/img]\r<br />Levels with Player.\r<br />Sneak Perks : Steath, Backstab, Deadly Aim, Asssassin&#39;s Blade, Muffled movement, Silent Roll, Silence, Shadow Warrior.\r<br />One Handed Perks : Rank 5 Armsman, Rank 3 Bladesman, Rank 2 Dual Flurry, Dual Savagery, Savage Strike, Critical Charge.\r<br />Default Equipment : Hide Armor, Hide Boots, Dragonbane.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-avjpeRaviQU/VI6wKgkW2GI/AAAAAAAADas/Y68Wcr41pfw/s1600/notes.png[/img]\r<br />You are very welcome to create videos :)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ahadeaxBHeI/VI6wJ_8lwiI/AAAAAAAADak/THaS7moezl8/s1600/features.png[/img]\r<br />Standalone\r<br />4K Body Texture\r<br />AFT/UFO Compatible\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jwbDUhZJe5k/VI6wL7onwXI/AAAAAAAADa8/rEhGmfL7vv4/s1600/updates.png[/img]\r<br />-12/25/2014\r<br />Added Emily&#39;s own house.\r<br />Added Emily&#39;s sister.\r<br />\r<br />-12/17/2014\r<br />Emily now have correct body mesh.\r<br />The resolution of her body texture is much higher, if this is too much for your system, lower or compress it with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12801/?]Optimizer Textures[/url].\r<br />Emily at solitude is removed.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7UOREObPbdk/VI6wJtfcYoI/AAAAAAAADag/KXlWg06cZqI/s1600/faq.png[/img]\r<br />[color=#c27ba0]Any other body supports?[/color]\r<br />No, it&#39;s pretty easy to change her body yourself.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#c27ba0]I&#39;m having black/invisible/brown texture issues, what should I do?[/color]\r<br />save the game and load it to see if that fixes it, if not reload the game.
