  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3]The Order of the Silver Phoenix is a new faction to Skyrim. Having the same functions of the Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, and Khajiit Traders they take part in any and all legal and illegal activities within the province of Skyrim. The original leader Do&#39;akha perished within a Nordic ruin while adventuring alone, so the leadership was taken hold of by the youngest of his three sons, M&#39;threi. \r<br />\r<br />[b][size=6]QUICK NOTE&#33;\r<br />[size=4]There is a glitch with the NPC&#39;s heads where they a different color from the rest of their body. If anyone knows how to fix this please PM me so the characters don&#39;t look stupid.\r<br />[/size][/size][/b]\r<br />[b]Also there&#39;s a Read Me.txt file in both downloads. It has the installation and uninstallation in case you don&#39;t want to come back and check the page and some more info.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br /> The first version of the mod is just the hideout which you can use as a personal player home or whatever you want.\r<br />\r<br />The second version of the mod has the members of the order within the hideout. They will not act aggressive unless you do first. They also have no function at the moment other than being there. In a few months there will be voice acting, quests, and more. Also, in the bedroom hall, the last bedroom (going to the left of the entrance) has an unowned bed/bedroom that you may use.\r<br />\r<br />There is a whole backstory to the guild and it&#39;s members which I am putting on a Microsoft Word doc if you want to download at a later date.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b]Installation\r<br />[/b][size=3]1.
