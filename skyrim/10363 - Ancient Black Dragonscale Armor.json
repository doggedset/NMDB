  "descriptionHtml": "Dark and slightly iridescent dragonscale armor (and shield) for both male & female complete with semi oxidized \\'dragonbronze\\' ligatures and fittings.  This is NOT just a darkened version of the original but has been repainted to subtly shift hues within the varied and dramatic lighting of Skyrim while still remaining very dark.  Perfect for a more shadowy warrior and looks especially dramatic when stained with enemy blood.\r\n\r\n[COLOR=#e36c09]This re-texture was designed to complement one of my other mods, a stand alone forgeable dragonscale armor set.
