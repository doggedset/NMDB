  "descriptionHtml": "Remember Morrowind\\'s Bloodmoon expansion? Solstheim was crawling with wolves, bears, and werewolves. It makes Solsteim look a little wimpy in the Dragonborn DLC for Skyrim. I made this mod to fix that. \r\n\r\nWhat it does: This mod adds a ton of wolf, werewolf, and bear encounters to northern Solstheim. It makes wandering the island of Solstheim slightly more dangerous with extra leveled werewolves. No more wandering around Solstheim looking for things to kill. This mod is even better if played in Legendary difficulty. \r\n\r\nREQUIRES DRAGONBORN DLC",
