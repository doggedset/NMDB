  "descriptionHtml": "    Alerik usually looks pretty grumpy, but has a heart of gold and will fight to the bitter end for his allies. His health is at 450 and stamina at 350, he is set as essential not invulnerable. He comes with Ebony Armor with the main file but I also posted a \\\"Fine Clothes\\\" version for those not running a follower customization mod. He also comes with a basic daedric sword and daedric bow. He is an option for marriage as well.\r\n\r\nThere are a few must have mods for this, just for the look to be correct\r\n you should have the following mods...\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488 BetterMales Beautiful Nudes and Faces, use the Younger Faces Merged with Men by Geonox.\r\n For the body use the same BetterMales mod FavoredSoulMeshes body of your choosing.\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13076 Cute Eyes 115X Makes the iris in the eye bigger to escape the tiny eye look.\r\n\r\n*************The armor in the screenshots is Vagabond Armor found in Immersive Armor mod by Hothtrooper44, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*******************************************************************\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19733] Immersive Armor by Hothtrooper44[/url]\r\n[URL=http://imgur.com/GSbV9][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/GSbV9.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\nInstallation: NMM recommended.\r\n\r\nManual, put the Alerik.ESP file in your skyrim/data file.
