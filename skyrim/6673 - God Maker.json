  "descriptionHtml": "[About]\r\nWhy use GOD maker? Well, TGM requires that you need to active it every time you start your game. It also has no limits in certain areas such as carry weight and also doesn\\'t give you all the perks, spells, or enchants (via dispell). This batch will do all of that and more. It gives you a tiny boost in every way possible.\r\n\r\nThis mod...\r\ndiscovers every location that has not yet been discovered (but they are not unlocked, until you visit them, so you know which ones you have not been to yet)\r\nincreases player speed at an acceptable rate\r\nincreases player weapon speed at an acceptable rate\r\nadds and unlocks every shout\r\ntakes away shout cooldown\r\ngives 500 carry weight\r\nmaxes every skill\r\nunlocks every perk\r\nmakes every spell more powerful\r\nmakes every spell cost nothing\r\nunlocks every player-usable spell\r\ngives you one of each type of enchantment for you to dispell\r\nmakes you immune to spells and disease\r\nincreases regen rates.\r\n\r\nFeel free to modify it to the way you see fit.\r\n\r\n[Install]\r\nplace the text file into the skyrim game directory.\r\n\r\ntypical install directory: \r\n64-bit: C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\r\n32 bit: C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\r\n\r\n[How to use]\r\nOnce you have placed GOD.txt into the same directory as TESV.exe then you will need to go into the game. Once in-game you will need to hit the tilde key, which is a key on your keyboard that looks like this -> [~]. Once you hit that key, type in \\\"bat GOD\\\" and hit enter. You should see a bit of text popping up. You may then hit [~] again to close the console. TADA! If you followed instructions then all is as it should be. You may open up the text file and alter it to accommodate what you think god-status should be if you wanna be super excessive or maybe make it a little less overpowered.\r\n\r\n\r\n[credits]\r\nMyself\r\nmmo-game.eu\r\nAll spells taken from: http://www.xboxmb.com/forum/103-elder-scrolls-series/89315-skyrim-how-make-use-batch-files-all-spells-perks-god.html\r\nAny other data was taken out of the wiki :)\r\n",
