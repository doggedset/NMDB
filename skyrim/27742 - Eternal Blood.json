  "descriptionHtml": "If you are sick of living your vampiric existence in fear of the sun\\'s detrimental effects then you can fear it a little less with this mod. Find the book Eternal Blood within Dimhollow on one of the thrones in the same room as the word wall along with the two corresponding vampiric artifacts and rest a little easier. This set of jewelry will slightly negate the sun\\'s effects on vampires and only vampires. Their enchantments only work outdoors during daylight hours. Think of them as a weak vampiric sun block. \r\n\r\nThis mod does not require any others. \r\n\r\nIf at anytime their effects are not listed in the active effects list re-equip them. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this small mod. Thanks and happy blood sucking!",
