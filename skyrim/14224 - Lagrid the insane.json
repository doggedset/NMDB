The mod is similar to Dead manor one altough i didn\\'t copy the idea, as i started to plan this mod before the other one got relased.\r\nThere\\'s a small background story to explain what has happened in the house, and you\\'ll gain a reward at the end of the adventure. I hope you\\'ll like it and you won\\'t find bugs, and please excuse me for my bad english!",
