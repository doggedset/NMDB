This whole harebrained plan of mine came about as a way to bypass the pet number limit; all I wanted was to have a dog and a chicken as followers, and since I already have the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34005/?]chicken[/url], I set about making a summonable dog that will not leave unless you use the spell to send it away. I made this mod for myself, really, but I&#39;m leaving it here in case someone else may want it as well.\r<br />\r<br />Version 2.0 makes some small changes - it adds a new necklace that, while worn, gives the player a   summoning lesser power to call Urist. To send her away, however, you still need a banishing spell, which has been modified to have a very low magicka cost and should NOT give you conjuration exp. The old regular spell books, with some new custom covers (because my dog loves bread), are still available, so upgrading from version 1.0 to 2.0 should be safe. I&#39;ll leave the old version that only adds summoning spell books up, in case someone may want to revert.\r<br />\r<br />You can find the items outside [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Silverdrift_Lair]Silverdrift Lair[/url]. The dog, being a simple summon, cannot be commanded around, but it has a ridiculous amount of health so it is basically essential. I am not planning on changing this, just so you know.\r<br /> \r<br />The file has been cleaned with TES5EDIT, [u]requires Dawnguard[/u], and has no scripts, so it should be safe for everybody to use. Still, you should always make a backup save before installing ANY mod, in case something goes wrong.\r<br />\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use the Mod Manager to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. \r<br />\r<br />Special thanks go to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37769/?]cansu[/url] for the fine German Sheperd textures, [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6468/?]Merilia[/url] (AKA Deandra) for free-to-use Additional Amulets - Unenchanted Necklaces, [url=http://icons8.com/]icons8[/url] for the bread icon, and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2263126/?]tg08096[/url] for priceless help and advice regarding making a new lesser power.
