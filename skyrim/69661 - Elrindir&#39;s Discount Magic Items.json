  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ff00ff][size=5]There&#39;s not enough merriment in Skyrim. Sorry, Cicero doesn&#39;t count. Where&#39;s the funny stuff?\r<br />So here&#39;s this little thing. It&#39;s not exactly funny, but it can be mistaken for vaguely humorous in a dim light.[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#3c78d8][size=4][u]Description:[/u][/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#ff0000]What magic turns cheese to wine?\r<br />Speak to Elrindir at the Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun.[/color]\r<br />[color=#980000]Discount Magic Items&#33;\r<br />Elrindir also has some nifty, oh-so-helpful gear for sale.[/color]\r<br />[color=#ff7700]The Why Of Questing\r<br />Speak to Seren in Dawnstar. She may have a new quest for you. Or maybe not.[/color]\r<br />[color=#ffff00]Serendipitous Silversmith Stupidity\r<br />Kerah of Markarth has a job for you.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />This is one of those mods you install, try out, say &#34;Huh&#33;&#34; to yourself, and uninstall to clear up space in your load order.\r<br />Give it ten minutes and hopefully it&#39;ll elicit a chuckle or two, and that&#39;s about it.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#3c78d8][size=4][u]To-do list:[/u][/size][/color]\r<br />Eh, I dunno... not much, really.\r<br />Maybe go in and fix emotion levels.\r<br />I should really also add &#34;not enough money&#34; checks so you can&#39;t get away with getting items for free.\r<br />I also need to fix the scroll - missing a casting effect.\r<br />I should also add in an actual magic effect for the gauntlets. And the horn, and the wand...\r<br />More sketches&#33;\r<br />Actually, I guess there&#39;s a sizeable list of things to do. Ah, well... maybe some day. Soon?\r<br />\r<br />[color=#3c78d8][size=4][u]FAQ:[/u][/size][/color]\r<br />Generally &#34;FAQ&#34; requires questions to be asked frequently. In this case, I&#39;m trying to anticipate questions instead.\r<br /> \r<br />Q: I&#39;m having a problem with this mod.\r<br />A: That&#39;s not only possible, it&#39;s likely. I&#39;m a newb to modding. Leave a comment and I&#39;ll get back to you. I can&#39;t guarantee I can fix a problem, but I&#39;ll do my best. :)\r<br /> \r<br />Q: I have a question about this or any other mod. Should I PM you?\r<br />A: No, please. Use the comment thread. That&#39;s what it is there for.\r<br /> \r<br />Q: Your mod conflicts with &lt;other mod&gt;.\r<br />A: That is highly unlikely, although I suppose if anything massively alters Elrindir it&#39;s certainly possible. In general, for stuff like this, put whichever one you want more lower on the list.\r<br /> \r<br />Q: Can I suggest &lt;feature&gt; or &lt;NPC&gt;?\r<br />A: Yes please&#33; I can&#39;t guarantee the request will get into the mod, because as I&#39;ve said I&#39;m not very good at modding, but I&#39;ll certainly consider it&#33;\r<br /> \r<br />Q: Can I translate your mod?\r<br />A: Certainly&#33; I didn&#39;t write it with any sort of translation in mind, though, and I do tend to use American English idioms and phrasing, so... good luck&#33; Go ahead and post your translation in the support thread and I will link to it in the download page. If you do make a translation, be a lamb and either send me the file so I can upload it, or at least post a link so I can add it to the description.\r<br /> \r<br />Q: Can I or you upload this to another site?\r<br />A: I&#39;d rather you didn&#39;t.\r<br />\r<br />Q: What about patches or updates?\r<br />A: Make a request or suggestion&#33;",
