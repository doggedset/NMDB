  "descriptionHtml": "I like cats. I like khajiits. Do you? \r\n\r\nThis mod changes the playable races\\' appearance into khajiits. This mod affects children as well.\r\n\r\nAll racials traits and skills remains and the facial features including hair, beards and facemarks are carried over from the previous looks. Children also now have different clothes because default children clothes are not designed to fit khajiits. \r\n\r\nWhat has changed: \r\n-All playable races looks like khajiits. \r\n-Children wear different clothes to accomodate beast body.\r\n\r\nWhat hasn\\'t changed:\r\n-Existing khajiits are unchanged.\r\n-Monsters, Animals, Dremoras and Undead are untouched. \r\n-Racial skills and traits remains unaltered. \r\n-Hair and beard are still on the non-native khajiits.\r\n-Text and voice are the same. \r\n\r\nVersion 1.31\r\n\r\nThis is Fluffy, from the Skyrim Steam Workshop, I\\'m uploading this to Skyrim Nexus under an old account I never used before. Updates will go to the Steam Workshop version before it reaches the Nexus, but I\\'ll try to keep this updated. \r\n\r\nThanks to the Skyrim wikis for the presensation picture. This mod uses default head meshes, so some conflicts may happens with mods that changes the default head meshes or body skeletons. \r\n\r\nHave fun.",
