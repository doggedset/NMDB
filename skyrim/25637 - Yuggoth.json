Search the area for clues that will lead you to the dungeon where you will uncover the mystery of the fate of its inhabitant and his interactions with the people of Riverwood. \r<br />\r<br />Included are new player items, dozens of pages of new text to read and a strange alchemy ingredient growing in the area. The story, items and home are all lore-friendly and mesh seamlessly into Skyrim. Yuggoth takes some detective work to find, there are several paths to take and a large number of clues to solve, all of which will paint a more complete picture of the mystery behind Yuggoth. Keep your eyes open and have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Yuggoth should be compatible with almost all mods, there may be conflicts with any mods that significantly alter the area of Riverwood.\r<br />\r<br />---UPDATES---\r<br />\r<br />1.3: Bug fixes.\r<br />     Small new content additions...\r<br />     Chest changes --&gt; Smithing Chest is now a respawning Ingots chest.\r<br />     Lore tweaks --&gt; Alchemy text has been re-written.\r<br />     Alchemy Tweaks --&gt; New magic mushroom effects\r<br />     Borowik&#39;s Outfit Addition.\r<br />     New campsites.\r<br />\r<br />1.2: Navmesh improved.\r<br />     More containers added.\r<br />     Player containers are now set to no-respawn.\r<br />     Added weapon racks.\r<br />     Lighting fixes.\r<br />     Loot balancing and additions.\r<br />     Player item balances.\r<br />     Particle effect fixes.\r<br />     Larger main entrance for realism purposes.\r<br />     Added more new content to the forest around Riverwood.\r<br />     Added a new collectible item.\r<br />     Added more clues in and around Riverwood.\r<br />\r<br />1.1: Navmesh fixed for player followers.\r<br />\r<br />Please do not re-upload my mod to any other site, for now it is Nexus only&#33; Thank you.\r<br />\r<br />",
