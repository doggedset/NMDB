I know similar mods have been made before, but I&#39;ll upload this one here just in case.\r<br />\r<br />These guys are essential and have the same stats as the originals. You can also marry them. Hadvar can be found wandering around Riverwood, and Ralof is outside the Windhelm stables. Why Windhelm? Because I like that town. Since they are duplicates of the originals, you can perfectly do the main quests with them in tow, and let them meet their doppelg√§ngers.\r<br />\r<br />I had to change Hadvar&#39;s voice, since the original does not allow him to follow or marry the player. I found one that&#39;s similar enough, I think. Ralof keeps his original voice.\r<br />\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#39;SteamSteamAppsCommonSkyrimData&#39; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
