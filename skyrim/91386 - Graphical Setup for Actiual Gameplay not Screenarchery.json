  "summary": "A long, but detailed and concise guide to my personal graphical setup for Skyrim.  This setup is designed to make Skyrim look as beautiful and semi-realistic as possible, while using the least amount of ESPs as possible.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Modding Skyrim to look stunningly beautiful AND overhauling major aspects of the core gameplay often results in severe loss of FPS, so I tried to make Skyrim look as great as possible in my own personal taste, while using the least amount of ESPs possible to ensure that I could later add as many plugins to the game as I wanted without a serious FPS loss.Â  This guide will walk you through the installation of all the mods in detail to make this guide as least confusing as possible.",
