  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i1031.photobucket.com/albums/y372/vegito12/Banner3.jpg[/img]\r\n[color=\\\\\\\"#00FF00\\\\\\\"]\r\n***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r\nSo, I have been gone for quite a bit of time. And in that time I have acquired a better vocabulary as well as better punctuation and grammar skills. The next update WILL have beast races. I will also add an optional version so you can summon your pet more than once a day due to a request.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this mod is to make hunting a better experience in Skyrim. For me it\\'s a stale and repetitious act only used to kill time. As you progress through the game, it becomes easier and easier to kill animals. My goal is to add new,stronger, versions of the already existing animals as well as new and stronger weapons to help you take on these animals. I will also add \\\"rare\\\" animals you can find and kill in the wild for great loot to make new weapons. \r\nRight now, I only have the human races, but you can expect the other\\'s VERY soon.\r\n\r\nHunter race:\r\nArchery 10\r\nLight Armor 8\r\nSneak 8\r\nOne Handed 5\r\nSmithing 4\r\n\r\nPowers and ability\\'s:\r\nSummon Familiar: Summons a familiar until killed\r\nPlus 20 damage to animals\r\n\r\nAll races keep their attributes (example\\\" Nord\\'s resistance to frost) but do not keep their powers (example: Battle Cry)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMods:\r\nThe mods in the picture(s) are\r\nThe armor:is Nordic Hunter Light Armor by frankdema\r\nThe hood is:Winter is Coming: Cloaks by Nivea\r\nthe arrows are: Reapers Dread Knight Arrows by Reaper9111\r\n[/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
