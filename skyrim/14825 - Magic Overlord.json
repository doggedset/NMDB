  "descriptionHtml": "Some court wizard and mage in Skyrim claims that magic is the true power. But sadly magic in Skyrim by default are much much weaker that a swing of battle axe or a shot from bow. This mod will make magic much stronger and more usefull especially in Master difficulty.\r\n\r\nOverview of what this mod do:\r\n- Make mastery perk of each school scale associated spell damage and duration. For example Adept Destruction spell such as Fireball and Chain Lightning will scale only of you take Adept Destruction perk.\r\n- Staves damage and duration now also scale with associated perk, but much stronger than spell casted with hand. This will give you more reason to rely more on staves (which in vanila gameplay I rarely use personally).\r\n- Fix some bug in some spell.\r\n- Make Master level spell more usefull by cutting its casting time.\r\n- Magic Armor spell are stronger.\r\n- Make Bound weapon more stronger by scale their damage with associated perk and swing faster (it should be because bound weapon don\\'t have weight).\r\n- Dual Casting are more efficient (consume 2.5x magicka to reproduce 2.5x damage)\r\n\r\nFor changelog click the version number. Here\\'s the detail what this mod do on the latest version:\r\n\r\nDestruction School:\r\n- Novice to Expert perk will scale 1% damage per skill of associated Destruction spells, 2% for associated staves.\r\n- Master perk scale 2%. \r\n- Cut Destruction Master Spell (Firestorm, Blizzard, Lightning Storm) cast time to 1 sec only.\r\n- Fix Wall spells description true to their real damage (not just static 50 points) and double their base damage to be more usefull.\r\n- Fix Cloak spells description true to their real damage (not just static 8 points) and get benefit from appropriate augmented perk.\r\n- Fix Rune spells to get benefit from appropriate augmented perk.\r\n- Fix Staff of Thunderbolt using proper enchantment (vanila still using Lightning Bolt).\r\n- Fix Blizzard spell should not hurt caster.\r\n- Expert Spell such Incinerate, Icy Spear, and Thunderbolt now have more interesting effects instead of just stronger damage version of Firebolt, Ice Spike, and Lightingbolt. The new effects are on impact will do small explosion and wall effects.\r\n\r\nIllusion School:\r\n- Each mastery perk will scale 1% magnitude and duration per skill of associated Illusion spells, 2% for associated staves.\r\n- Master perk scale 2%.\r\n- Cut Illusion Master Spell (Hysteria, Call to Arms, Harmony, Mayhem) cast time to 1 sec only.\r\n- Fix so Aspect of Terror perk should not affect fire spells damage.\r\n\r\nAlteration School:\r\n- Each mastery perk will scale 1% magnitude and duration per skill of associated Alteration spells, 2% for associated staves.\r\n- Master perk scale 2%.\r\n- Cut Alteration Master Spell (Dragonhide, Mass Paralysis) cast time to 1 sec only.\r\n- Equilibrium spell will cost health less.\r\n- Change calculation of Mage Armor perk so it goes well with skill scaling.\r\n- Dragonhide spell now also cut magic damage by 25% and have base duration 60 sec.\r\n- Stability perk now double the spell duration (instead of increase 50%).\r\n- Magic Armor Spell also fortify unarmed damage. Oakflesh add 10 pts unarmed damage, Stoneflesh 15 pts, Ironflesh 20 pts, Ebonyflesh 25pts, Dragonhide 35 pts.\r\n\r\nRestoration School:\r\n- Each mastery perk will scale 1% magnitude and duration per skill of associated Restoration spells, 2% for associated staves.\r\n- Master perk scale 2%.\r\n- Cut Restoration Master Spell (Bane The Undead, Guardian Circle) cast time to 1 sec only.\r\n\r\nConjuration School:\r\n- Each mastery perk will scale 1% magnitude and duration per skill of associated Conjuration spells, 2% for associated staves.\r\n- Master perk scale 2%.\r\n- Novice perk will scale Bound Sword damage 1% per skill.\r\n- Apprentice perk will scale Bound Battleaxe damage 1% per skill.\r\n- Adept perk will scale Bound Bow damage 1% per skill.\r\n- Mystic Binding are twice stronger.\r\n- Since bound weapon have no weight and it should be faster to swing. Bound sword 30% faster, Bound Battle Axe 50% faster, bow 50% faster.\r\n- Cut Conjuration Master Spell (Dead Thrall, Flame Thrall, Frost Thrall, Storm Thrall) cast time to 1 sec only.\r\n- Fix conjure spell get self-absorbed.\r\n- Potent Atronach now have double level than non-potent.\r\n- Dremora Lord also have double level.\r\n- DarkSoul now add 200HP.\r\n- Soul Stealer make Bound Weapon absobs 20 pts of health and stamina.\r\n- Oblivion Binding now effective to stronger summons.\r\n\r\nI drew inspiration to make this mod because of other magic enhancement mod (thank you very much for making great magic enhancement mods) before me such as:\r\n- Better Magic by Kevin Kidder (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4374)\r\n- Mighty Magick Skyrim by Damar Stiehl (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13166)\r\n- Bound Weapon Redux by Aertyr (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13643)\r\n\r\nCheck out their amazing mods if you feel my mod doesn\\'t fit your style.
