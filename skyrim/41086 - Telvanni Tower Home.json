  "descriptionHtml": "A Telvanni Tower Mushroom home build next to Tel Mithryn for those that like to play as a Telvanni wizard. REQUIRES DAWNGUARD, DRAGONBORN AND HEARTFIRE. \r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE IS LOCATED NEXT TO TEL MITHRYN SO FASTRAVEL TO THERE.\r\n\r\nThe First time I saw the Giant Mushroom with the amazing float up spell, I really liked to create one myself, after months of the Dragonborn released I finally decided to do it. I am satisfied with the way it look now, but I am open for requests if they fit my vision upon the home.  The home itself have a large laboratory and holds everything a player should need. I decided to not add mannequins as they bug as hell, but I might give it another shot soon. \r\n\r\nThe House:\r\nKitchen\r\nBedroom\r\nAlchemy labs\r\nEnchanting labs\r\nStaff enchanter\r\nLiving room\r\nVault\r\nGarden\r\n\r\nSpider scroll maker ( NOT WORKING!)  I really am trying to figure it out, if anyone knows how to get it to work let me know!!.\r\n\r\nThere should be enough storage,  All chests, satchels etc are safe and empty.\r\nWeapon racks\r\nWeapon Display Cases\r\nDagger Display case\r\n\r\nThere also is a small mushroom house next to it with:\r\n\r\nTanning rack,\r\nForge\r\nWorkbench\r\nSmelter\r\nStorage\r\n\r\nYou are able to fast travel to here with using the black book on the office table next to all the maps.\r\n\r\nI really hope you like it!\r\n\r\nPlease report bugs if any. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
