  "summary": "",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a mod for Skyrim which replaces most of the soundtrack (music) of Skyrim with much better-sounding, more captivating music. \r<br />\r<br />NOTE: I did not create/ compose ANY of this music, and all music rights go to the names below. \r<br />\r<br />Credits for music: Mattia Cupelli, Andrian Von Ziegler, Jeremy and Julian Soule, Jesper Kyd, Junichi Nakatsuru, Thomas Begersen and Nick Phoenix, Russell Brower, Martin O&#39; Donnell and Michael Salvatori, Lisa Gerrard, Christophe Beck, Jamie Christopherson, Hideyuki Fukasawa, Shunsuke Kida, Motoi Sakuraba, Yuki Kajiura, Tadayoshi Makino, and jdrcomposer(youtube name) \r<br />\r<br />NOTE 2: If you have Open Cities: Skyrim, this causes problems and songs will overlap when you enter any town or city, and I will soon make a version for Open Cities: Skyrim, so this does not occur for users of both mods. \r<br />\r<br />NOTE 3: This mod does not effect the main menu theme and will not conflict with a mod that ONLY changes the main theme. \r<br />\r<br />Personally, I recommend that you get the mods called &#39;Sounds of Skyrim&#39;, when you get this mod. It will give you a more captivating experience, but will be even more so with this mod.",
