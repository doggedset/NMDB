  "descriptionHtml": "\r<br />\r<br />Bulk Crafting - A Crafting Mod v.1.0\r<br />-kjtest21\r<br />Hello&#33;\r<br />This simple, tiny mod adds a few bulk-esque crafting recipes to the game. I was tired of mashing my \r<br />poor buttons when I wanted to make a lot of 1 thing. So, this is what I did.\r<br />\r<br />[u][center]Installation:[/center][/u]\r<br />In the Zip file there are multiple ESP files, all with different versions attached to them. Only pick \r<br />the one that applies to your game\r<br />DG = Dawnguard\r<br />HF = Hearthfires\r<br />DB = Dragonborn\r<br />Do not mix and match, just pick one :)\r<br />Vanilla changes are made to every single .esp\r<br />\r<br />[u][center]Changes:[/center][/u]\r<br />Vanilla Skyrim:\r<br />\r<br />Made changes to every Smelting recipie - \r<br />Made a recipie for x5, x10, x25 for ingots at x5/10/25 original ore requirements\r<br />Added a recipie for leather strips x20, x40, x60, x80, and x100 At 5x leath, x10, x15, x20, and x25.\r<br />Added 2 more recipies each for each type of pelt at x2, x5 of the pelts. Each pelt produces the \r<br />default amount, just added multiplier (Example: Bear Pelt produces x4 leather, each bulk multiples \r<br />that by x2(8 Leather) for x5(20 Leather)\r<br />These recipies will only appear once the materials are in your inventory, I also changed the x1 \r<br />recipies to work in the same fashion\r<br />\r<br />Hearthfire: \r<br />\r<br />Added 4 bulk recipes:\r<br />Nails x50 = 5 Iron Ingots\r<br />Locks x5 = 5 Corundum and 5 Iron Ingots \r<br />Hinge x10 = 5 Iron Ingots\r<br />Fittings x5 = 5 Iron Ingots\r<br />\r<br />Dawnguard:\r<br />\r<br />Added Bulk Recipes for Arrows and Bolts\r<br />x24 stays the same \r<br />Added x120 recipies at 5 Times ingredients for arrows\r<br />added x50 recipies at 5 times ingredients for bolts\r<br />Adds x2 and x5 Pelt recipies for Vale Deer and vale Sabre Cat\r<br />Dragonborn:\r<br />Added Bulk Recipes for Arrows\r<br />x24 stays the same\r<br />Adds Nordic and Stalhrim x120 recipes at 5 times ingredients\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]Compatibility/Info For modders:[/u]\r<br />This mod changes the default crafting recipes only and adds new ones. If a mod adds pelts/ore/etc to \r<br />the game, this mod will do nothing for those particular items. That being said, if a mod changes the \r<br />default recipies in any way, and you expect to use the Bulk mod, load this one AFTER that mod. I have \r<br />tested with SkyRE (Changes quantity of Ore needed to 3, instead of 2) and this mod over takes those \r<br />changes because I load this one after SkyREmain.esp\r<br />I have not, and probably will not ever create compatiblity patches with every mod in the universe. I \r<br />may create patches for SkyRe, IC, and may CO. But, proper load order should resolve any issues.",
