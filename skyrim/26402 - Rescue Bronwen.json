  "descriptionHtml": "Skyrim meets TAKEN in this violent, fully voiced, quest about a beautiful missing girl. Raven Dark has been asking for you in the Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun. His daughter has gone missing and he wants you to find her no matter what, and punish those responsible. \r\n\r\nThis adventure (finally available on Nexus after 3 months on Steam!) includes full voice acting, with work from the Skyrim Voice Actors Guild. It includes a new dungeon, and a new cast of heroes and evil enemies. You will be fighting against deadly opponents and can make conversation choices that reflect your personality. You will have the opportunity to acquire a new romantic-themed and voiced companion with her own personality.\r\n\r\nThis mod requires no other mods to play.\r\n\r\nIf you appreciate the time we spent on this mod, please endorse.
