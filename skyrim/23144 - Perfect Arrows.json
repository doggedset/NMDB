  "descriptionHtml": "Attention : BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD THE MOD, IT\\'S BETTER IF YOU READ THE WHOLE DESCRIPTION FIRST. THANK YOU\r\nWhat does this mod do?\r\nBasically, it is an arrow tweak that makes the arrow go straight forward in the middle of your cross-hair and makes all arrows faster ( about 1.5x faster than the original).\r\n\r\nalso watch my video :)\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6TKrku1-X4\r\nI\\'m trying to find a way to post this video in hyperlink so you have to copy and paste it for now :)\r\nOr you could watch the video in the  video section of this page\r\n\r\nUpdate\r\n * Arrows now are fast as speed of light\r\n * Created A Daedric Standalone Arrow that travel as fast as the speed of light\r\n                      - Can be forged. Daedric Smithing Perk Required\r\n                                              Forge option can be found at Misc.\r\n\r\nI don\\'t know if this works without the T3nd0s Skyrim Redone Because T3nd0s Skyrim Redone was used with the editing.\r\nBut Still try even you don\\'t have it since the arrows of T3nd0s Skyrim Redone And the Original version has the same variables.\r\nI\\'ve modded the arrows of T3nd0s Skyrim Redone. The following arrows modded are:\r\nArrow - Orcish\r\nArrow - Steel\r\nArrow - Daedric\r\nArrow - Ebony\r\nArrow - Elven\r\nArrow - Farmer\r\nArrow - Forsworm\r\nArrow - Glass\r\nArrow - Iron\r\nArrow - NordHero\r\n\r\nand got some omega2008\\'s proper aiming but changed some of it\\'s attributes. you could still download here\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13652. i don\\'t know which do you prefer so anyhow, let\\'s continue with the discussion.\r\n\r\nAlso, you have to do some manual working here...\r\nopen skyrim.ini file which is usually located in documents/my games/skyrim\r\nand add these lines:\r\n\r\n[Combat]\r\nf1PArrowTiltUpAngle=0.2\r\nf3PArrowTiltUpAngle=0.7\r\n[Actor]\r\nfVisibleNavmeshMoveDist=12288.0000\r\n\r\nIf you can\\'t get it, see the picture above.\r\nand THIS IS RECOMMENDED FOR YOU TO DO UNLESS YOU DON\\'T WANT THE MOD TO COMPLETELY WORK\r\n\r\nthese lines don\\'t have to be initially existing though, so don\\'t worry if you don\\'t have it.\r\nso..here\\'s what it does\r\nthe lines below the combat tilts up the angle of your arrow.\r\nf1PArrowTiltUpAngle means that you\\'ll set the angle tilt from which you are in the 1st person view since f1P is the keyword i suppose.\r\n\r\nf3PArrowTiltUpAngle means that you\\'ll set the angle tilt from which you are in the 3st person view since f3P is the keyword.\r\n\r\nNow, the effect of fVisibleNavmeshMoveDist is that your arrow will disappear at a very far distance like when you\\'re hunting some mammoths, because that\\'s what i usually do. of course you don\\'t want to be pounded when it detects you so you\\'d prefer to have a big distance between you and the mammoth. now, this is what happens. even though you\\'re sure that the arrows you launch to that mammoth would hit, you notice that nothing happens. that\\'s because the arrow disappeared. unlike if you add this setting, it would surely hit regarding that your pointing at the mammoth.\r\n\r\nYou could change the settings to the one you prefer but it will have a slight different from mine.\r\n\r\nDanger... Not only your arrows will be faster and accurate.... But also your enemies so be careful :)\r\n\r\nNext Update : Arrow Bolts\r\n                    Longer Range arrows \r\n\r\nOh, btw, evidence0 is just my username, my real codename is ShaezIce.\r\nPS: if you have any request, just comment.. i\\'ll be checking every day.\r\n\r\nThank You\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nomega2008\\'s proper aiming\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13652\r\n\t\r\nT3nd0s Skyrim Redone\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286\r\n",
