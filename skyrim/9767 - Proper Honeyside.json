  "descriptionHtml": "[center][youtube]HrqXXkNcfvc[/youtube][/center]\r\n\r\nWarning! \\\"Ghost\\\" objects may appear if you brought Honeyside before activating this mod. They can be deleted in console by using \\\"markfordelete\\\" console command. If anyone knows how to fix this i would greatly appreciate help.\r\n\r\nDownload this mod at your own risk!\r\n\r\nUpdate: Added version with alot more bookspace in which housecarl also stays in her room. \r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\nThis mod is for those that were bothered with the fact, that Honeyside has pretty much least storage in terms of player housing.\r\n\r\nIn my personal opinion this does in no way overpower the house. The house is of course upgradeable, you do not get everything from the start.\r\n\r\nAnother important change is redesign of basement so it is no longer bigger than the actual house or having bigger dimensions than on the outside.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\nList of changes:\r\n\r\n-Added 3 storage chests, one in the storage area by the stairs and chests for enchanting and alchemy near the respective workstations.\r\n-Added another bookcase.\r\n-Added door between the staircase and bedroom.\r\n-Removed most of the hunting trophies, they made the place look smaller than it is. And i hate those.\r\n-Remade the basement level, removed the housecarl room which is now in the former enchanting room, which is cut in half and separated by door from the rest of basement.\r\n-Moved most things from enchanting room to the alchemy room.\r\n-(Optional alternative file) House carl now sits in her room in the basement\r\n-I Stole all the sweet rolls\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nWarning!\r\n\r\nIf you have already moved in to the house before installing this mod, remember to clean up non-static items from the changed areas.\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nInstallation\r\n\r\nExtract the TheClone Honeyside.esp from the zip and move the file to your ...Skyrim/Data/ folder. Make sure the mod is allowed in the launcher, when you select Data files.\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nIf you like the redesign, be sure to check out my other mod, [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9600]Shorter Breezehome[/url].\r\nI might make other redesigns in the future these redesigns were made for myself first.\r\nFeel free to use the redesigns anywhere you want, just list me as the author.",
