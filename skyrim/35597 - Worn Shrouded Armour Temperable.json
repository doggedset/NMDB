  "descriptionHtml": "Worn Shrouded Armour Temperable\r\n\r\n==================\r\nDescription:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nContinuing with my \\'fix stuff that do not make sense\\' mod series, this mod adds tempering recipes for worn shrouded armour pieces. The worn shrouded armour is often a preferred alternative to the \\'regular\\' shrouded armour because it is does not come with pre-existing enchantments and can be enchanted by the player, so now it can be tempered too. Also, the worn shrouded armour worn by the random Dark Brotherhood assassin NPC will now drop as loot (and can be tempered as well), because I have no idea why it couldn\\'t be looted to begin with.  \r\n\r\n==================\r\nDetails:\r\n==================\r\n\r\n- disables the \\'unplayable\\' flag for the version of the worn shrouded armour normally not dropped as loot.\r\n- adds tempering recipes for the \\'playable\\' and the \\'unplayable\\' versions of the worn shrouded armour.\r\n- in the base game, both versions are identical in stats, except the \\'unplayable\\' version does not have the \\'x2 backstab damage\\' enchantment--which I have now fixed.\r\n- the requirements for tempering the worn shrouded armour are exactly the same as the shrouded armour, including the requisite Dark Brotherhood quest stage.\r\n\r\n==================\r\nInstallation:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nI recommend you install mods using a mod manager like the \\'Nexus Mod Manager\\' or the \\'Mod Organizer.\\' If installing manually, just extract the archive into the game \\'.../data/\\' folder.\r\n\r\n==================\r\nUn-Installation:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nUninstall using the same mod manager you installed it with. If uninstalling manually, delete \\'Worn Shrouded Armour Fixes.esp\\' from \\'.../data/\\'. \r\n\r\n==================\r\nConflicts:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nThis mod will conflict with any mod that edits the \\'unplayable\\' version of the worn shrouded armour pieces. Otherwise, there will be no possible conflict what-so-ever.\r\n\r\nPlugin has been checked and cleaned in TES5Edit. \r\n\r\n==================\r\nChangelog:\r\n==================\r\n\r\n04/05/2013 - Initial Release\r\n\r\n==================\r\nContact Details:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nMy username is Ripple on both the official Bethesda forums and the Nexus. You know the rest.\r\n\r\n==================\r\nCredits:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r\nThanks to the Oblivion/Fallout 3/Fallout NV/Skyrim modding communities for advice and help throughout the years.",
