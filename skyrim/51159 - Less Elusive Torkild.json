  "descriptionHtml": "Having trouble finding Torkild (Wulf&#39;s brother) during the Filial Bonds quest? This mod makes it much more likely for him to appear around northern Solstheim when he is supposed to. You&#39;ll still have to do some poking around in order to find him, but his probability of appearance won&#39;t be vanishingly small anymore.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation[/b]\r<br />Drop the ESP in your data folder.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Compatibility[/b]\r<br />Theoretically, this mod could conflict with other mods that mess with Solstheim encounters, but it&#39;s perfectly fine with every other mod in my load order (including Skyrim Immersive Creatures). Please let me know if you encounter any incompatible mods out there.",
