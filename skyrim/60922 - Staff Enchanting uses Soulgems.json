  "descriptionHtml": " This mod removes the heartstone component from staff enchanting and replaces it with an equivilant filled soul gem. \r<br />\r<br />What this means is crafting enchanted staves using Dragonborns staff enchanter now requires a soul gem and not a heart stone. \r<br />\r<br />depending on the staff you are crafting determines on the soul gem required. \r<br />I have made it so that the enchantment (the spell) requires a soul gem of the same level. \r<br />\r<br />For example a Staff of Flames requires a Petty Filled Soul gem as the spell, Flames, is a novice spell\r<br />while a staff of Icy Spear requires a Greater Filled Soul gem, as the Icy spear spell is an Expert Spell. \r<br />\r<br />So in short: \r<br />\r<br />Novice spells = Filled petty soul gem\r<br />Apprentice spells = Filled Lesser soul gem\r<br />Adept Spells = Filled Common Soul gem\r<br />Expert spells = Filled Greater Soul gem\r<br />\r<br />Why have I done this? It made no sense that Staff enchanting requires heartstones, an item that only exists due to the Ash storms of the Red year ( the year the red mountain\r<br />of Morrowind erupted). Heartstones seem to be presented as a new and powerful resource in Dragonborn yet Enchanted staves have existed for a long time. Heck nearly every mage\r<br />in skyrim alone has one; are we to believe that they all traveled to Skyrim and used that one staff enchanter? No. \r<br />\r<br />This mod works great with any other mod that adds Staff Enchanters around Skyrim such as my own mod &#34;Dragonborn is part of Skyrim&#34;.\r<br />",
