  "descriptionHtml": "*Requires Dawnguard\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod started out with the aim to fix the major Vampire Lord bugs and make some of the abilities scale for higher level characters. All of the changes have been carefully calculated to stay within lore and to maintain the integrity of the vanilla feel of the game. Without further ado I will get into the details of what this mod does:\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n________________________________________________\r\n\r\nVampire Lord Fixes:\r\n\r\n- The Vampire Lord Absorption Spell fixed (now does full damage even if Serana is your follower)\r\n- Ring of the Beast now has the proper description in active effects.\r\n- The Gargoyle Spell is not affected by absorption perk or Atronach Stone.\r\n- Summoned Gargoyles now scales with the player’s level up to level 43\r\n- Power claw attacks now stagger opponents; however you need the talon upgrade perk.\r\n\r\nVampire Lord Form Tweaks:\r\n\r\n- Vampiric Grip damage adjusted to 10 damage per second. (originally was 5 per second)\r\n- Night Cloak adjusted to 15 damage per second. (originally was  4 per second)\r\n- Raise Dead spell now scales up to level 60 (originally was 36)\r\n- Vampire Lord’s melee damage now scales to 60 damage at level 50+ (was 40)\r\n\r\nCharacter Ability scale charts:\r\n\r\nVampire Lord’s Scalable melee talon damage\r\nLevel  10 +5 damage\r\nLevel  15 +10 damage\r\nLevel  20 +15 damage\r\nLevel  25 +20 damage\r\nLevel  30 +25 damage\r\nLevel  35 +30 damage\r\nLevel  40 +40 damage\r\nLevel  45 +50 damage\r\nLevel  50plus +60 damage\r\n\r\nSo now a level 50+ Vampire Lord will do 60 base damage +20 points of poison damage (with ring of the beast 100 damage total) \r\n\r\nVampire Raise dead spell\r\nTier 1 has a magnitude of 12 (was 8)\r\nTier 2 has a magnitude of 24 (was 16)\r\nTier 3 has a magnitude of 36 (was 24)\r\nTier 4 has a magnitude of 48 (was 30)\r\nTier 5 has a magnitude of 60 (was 36)\r\n\r\nSo now the player can use still raise dead at higher levels, honestly I don’t know what Beth was thinking here. It’s kind of silly when a level 50 vampire lord can’t raise a city guard or a bandit anymore because the player reaches a certain level. \r\n",
