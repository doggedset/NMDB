  "descriptionHtml": "For use with the Poisoned perk in the Pickpocket skill tree.  First place the dFx3 Assassin Dagger in the target\\'s inventory and then place a poison.  Target\\'s inventory must be closed within 30 seconds (real time) of placing the dagger.  Target will receive 3 times normal damage if successful.  For instance, if you normally do 100 damage with a placed poison, with the dagger included the total damage will be 300.  Should work with any type of poiosn, even new ones added by mods and DLCs.\r\n\r\ndFx3 Assassin Dagger will be added to the player\\'s inventory on activation of mod.\r\n\r\nIf you try out this mod, please leave a comment.  I am always interested in feedback, good or bad.\r\n\r\nThis is mostly to fill a request.  Suggestions welcome on how to make it lore friendly.",
