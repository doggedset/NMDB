  "descriptionHtml": "Please ENDORSE if you like the followers, Thank You.\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod ever, so any advice would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to ask questions as well.\r\n\r\nI love Argonians and noticed the lack of followers/marriage potential with this wonderfully scaled race.  So I built these 3 female and 2 male argonians from scratch based off of my player characters.\r\n\r\nThey are located at the INN of Riverwood\r\n\r\nScarlett Heart-Piercer is an Archer\r\n\r\nSai Sharp-Edge is a 2-handed warrior\r\n\r\nKannott Seer-of-Beyond is a blind destruction mage with fire/frost spells and can dual cast\r\n\r\nRobb Lar-Cenee is a Dual-wielding assassin\r\n\r\nIskarr Scale-Shield is a Tank with 1h mace and shield\r\n\r\nAll are essential (they can\\\\\\'t die) and marriageable.\r\n\r\nRecommended mods (ones i use): \r\n\r\nCBBEv3:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666\r\n\r\nA Beast Race Beautiful CBBE\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2995\r\n\r\nBigger Argonian Tails:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17339\r\n\r\nUFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037\r\n\r\nRequired mods: NONE\r\n\r\nMy inspiration to create this mod was because of another modder that had previously created argonian followers, check out his female argonian followers out.  His user is ManiacJehu and his mod can be found here: \r\n\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=93788815\r\n\r\nP.S. - If you wish to use this mod for tinkering feel free, all I ask is that if you end up publishing another mod, please give credit/link to my original; Thank You.",
