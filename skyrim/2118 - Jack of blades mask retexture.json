  "descriptionHtml": "····················\r\nSkyrim mod\r\n····················\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is a brand new retexture of the notorious villian Jack of blades from one of my favourite role playing game of all time (Fable 1) \r\nTwo dragonpriest helmets have been retextured one is light armour and one is heavy armour which includes the Vokun helmet and the Krosis helmet also included is retextured hood that goes with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1234\r\n\r\nDownload this mod whick enables you to craft them at a blacksmiths anvil using dragonscales and/or dragonbone.\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can typ in these command console lines to obtain them instantly:\r\nVokun 00061CC9\r\nKrosis 00061CB9\r\n\r\nAs i understand there is already a jack of blades armour retexture however it cannot be completed until the construction sets release and so i am not doing any armour retextures because of this because\r\n we dont want jack of blades running around everywhere :P\r\n\r\nHow do I install it?\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nJust unpack the files in your data folder and overwrite if prompted overwrite.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is only a retex, so there are no compatibility issues except with mods that alter the same files as this one.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture release\r\n==========================\r\n**************************\r\n\r\nThis at the moment is just the textures for the mask however a set of samurai swords are in the process and upon release of the long awaited construction kit i plan to recreate his armour and more importantly the sword of aeons.\r\nThis mask and jack of blades other two masks masks (Hate and Insanity) will be unique masks with unique strengths when the construction kit comes out but for now this is all i can do.\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me about any ideas for fable rebuild mods and i will certainly think them over.",
