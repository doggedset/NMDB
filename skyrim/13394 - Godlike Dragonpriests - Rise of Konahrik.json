  "descriptionHtml": "=========================================================================================\r\nDon\\'t like it? Too much health? Damage? Cheese? Pass in silence! Thanks.\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nConstructive Criticism is welcome, but please be aware that i\\'m no genius at modding. \r\n\r\nThis mod goes very well with my black/red dragon priest retexture: \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4303\r\ncheck it out, if interested. :)\r\n\r\n1. Description\r\n2.What this mod does.\r\n3.Installation\r\n4.Compatibility\r\n5.Credits/Permission\r\n6.Known Bugs ands Conflicts\r\n7.Dungeon walkthrough/Spoilers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.Description\r\n\r\nThis mod is the result of a self-inspiration incited by my other mod \\\"Godlike Dragonpriests\\\" http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12886 and will take said priests into a whole new level of combat efficiency. Some people may also asked themselves... We have a Konahrik Mask.. but no Konahrik. Well, this mod will change that too.\r\n\r\n2.What this mod does\r\nThis Mod adds 4 new spells, obtainable by finishing the short but challenging dungeon named Vanduindar near the riverwood bridge (mapmarker not included, the dungeon will jump almost into your face). You will experience some very special encounters up to the final showdown with the head of the dragon priesthood. For the lore lovers on the nexus, there is a book in the first room of the dungeon, you should read it ;). I also named most of the weapons in the dragon tongue. Check the site http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Language if you want to find out what those names are. \r\n\r\nEach of the usual 8 Dragonpriests (Krosis, Morokei etc.) recieved a new spell based on their combat style element, except Nahkriin, as he protects something very important in the mainstoryline, he will have all 3 elements at his disposal and will use them as he sees it fit against you.\r\nDragon Priest health is roughly increased by 150% and said spells ignore resistance/check below.\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nSidenote: \r\nThis mod comes in two versions, Godlike version (Dragon Priest Spells ignore resistance) and the Demi-god version (Dragon Priest Spells don\\'t ignore resistance).\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n3.Installation\r\nSimply put the Godlike Dragonpriests.esp into your datafolder and activate it under \\\"Data Files\\\" in your Skyrimlauncher. Uninstallation works the same way, just reversed.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.Compatibility\r\nThis Mod will conflict with any mod modifying Dragonpriests in any way.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.Credits/Permission\r\nAbove all else Bethesda Softworks for creating another awesome game in the TES Series.\r\nAcran2004 - Modification of spells, npcs and creating the dungeon. \r\nAsk me per PM if you want to use any of the content made by this modification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.Known Bugs ands Conflicts:\r\nTHIS WILL CONFLICT WITH MY OLD GODLIKE DRAGON PRIESTS MOD, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND UNINSTALLING BEFORE USING THIS ONE! \r\nFollower\\'s may behave weird in the dungeon, can\\'t do much about it unfortunately Navmesh is autogenerated and might not be perfect.\r\nRahgot drops his mask twice for whatever reason (not that anyone wouldn\\'t like this).\r\nDungeon Exterior May not be shown, leaving the Door \\\"naked\\\" on the ground (nonetheless accessible).\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please report any (major) bugs you find!\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nWARNING SPOILERS AHEAD, IF YOU WANT TO EXPLORE THE DUNGEON WITHOUT GETTING INFORMATION ABOUT WHATS INSIDE BEFOREHAND, STOP READING.\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Walkthrough\r\nA quick guide for players who fear they miss something in the dungeon. \r\nADVICE: Loot everything with a name on it.\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nLevel 1 Vanduindar: Be sure to explore everything BEFORE you jump down into one of the 2 holes and get the ring from the Juggernaut. Depending on your difficulty setting your might won\\'t get far without it.\r\nNote: If you got all 3 Decayed Tomes, it\\'s safe to jump down without missing anything.\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nLevel 2 Hall of the Highlord : Suit yourself!\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nLevel 3 Ritual Chamber : Prepare yourself to fight more than just one (vanilla) dragon priest. Proceed on the left side to continue to the end of the line.\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nLevel 4 Konahrik: This is it. Dodge or Die! Konahrik will his very own spell against you, Death and Decay, which will instantly kill you IF it hits, be quick on your feet and recongize it before it hits you but treat lightly the balcony isn\\'t so safe as you think. Choose between the risk of an enemy in your back or confront the warlord head on.\r\n\r\nKonahrik will drop the spell tome for death and decay, his mask and his very own ring which got the following stats (too long to see it all ingame) \r\n\r\nSpell costs of all schools reduced by 90%\r\n+500 Armor\r\n+200% Two-Handed Weapon Damage\r\n+100% One-Handed Weapon Damage\r\n+140% Ranged/Bow Damage\r\nGrants a green lightning effect on your character while charging spells",
