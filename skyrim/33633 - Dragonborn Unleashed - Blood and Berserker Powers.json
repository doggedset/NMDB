Any character can use any spell however.  Fire Aegis is to take the place of mist form for vampires, and berserker to fill the role of Blood Omen.  \r<br />\r<br />These abilites are OP&#39;d for normal vanilla game, but very helpful and fun to those running mods to make enemies stronger.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The Powers\r<br />\r<br />Blood Omen :  A Blood frenzy that boosts all damage and speed fueled by your Magicka.\r<br />Effects: \r<br />\r<br />- The ability can be toggled and will dispel when you run out of magicka\r<br />- Attack damage increased by 30%\r<br />- Spell damage increased by 70%\r<br />- Spells cost 60% less to cast\r<br />- Magicka depletes constantly while this ability is active\r<br />- You can waterwalk while this is active\r<br />- Your weaponspeed is 20% faster while this ability is active\r<br />- Your runspeed is 20% faster while this ability is active\r<br />- Your health regenerates 300% faster while active\r<br />- Stamina is fortified 300 points\r<br />- Bat cloak effect: Bats do damage to enemies and heal you for damage done\r<br />- Bats will feed on recently killed enemies nearby\r<br />- Effect dispels when you run out of magicka\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Leech Essence: Use the vampire Lords drain spell anytime.\r<br />\r<br />- It&#39;s the Vampire Lords life drain.  More of a focus on health restore than damage but still pretty potent.  AOE effect intact, removed it&#39;s ability to level up VLord perks.
