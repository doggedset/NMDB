  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple mod that alters climate in all regions so that it is always either overcast cloudy, fog, rain, storm, snow, blizzard depending on the region. There is only 6 types of weather. Overcast cloudy, rain, storm and overcast cloudy, snow, snow storm for snowy regions.\r\n\r\n NOTICE: Incompatible with any other mods that alter climate or weather. When you start from a save game that already has clear weather, weather will not change instantly. It will take up to 1 day or so. Also on a new game at Helgen weather is scripted, so it will be what ever it is scripted to be - does not mean this mod does not work.",
