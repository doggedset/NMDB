  "descriptionHtml": "[b]NOTE: REGARDING SKYRIM SPECIAL EDITION\r<br />\r<br />[/b]Hroki has been ported over to Skyrim Special Edition, preliminary testing without any other mods has shown encouraging results, Hroki has intact functionality as far as I can tell.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This is my first ever mod, it has been a part of my playthroughs for many years but I never quite plucked up the courage to release it. It turns Hroki of Markarth into an implausibly potent destruction mage, with a unique cloak spell and dragon shouts at her disposal. In addition to being powerful, she is also marriageable and immortal.\r<br />\r<br />Comments, critiques and bug reports welcome, I scoured this with TESVEdit, so hopefully by the grace of Goku, your computer won&#39;t scream in agony when running this. \r<br />\r<br />Concise Follower Stats:\r<br />\r<br />Name: Hroki the Valiant\r<br />Level: 50 onwards\r<br />Combat style: Destruction Mage with Dragon shouts\r<br />Location: Silver-Blood inn, Markarth (Note: her AI Packages are unchanged, she will wander around)\r<br />BodyType: Whatever you have installed, if anything.\r<br />\r<br />Health: approx. 1500\r<br />Magicka: approx 1200\r<br />Stamina: approx 200\r<br />Requires Dawnguard.esm, Dragonborn.esm, Update.esm and Skyrim (version 1.9-something-or-other, the latest and last)\r<br />\r<br />Developer notes: I have tested experimental character builds for Hroki, most notably, summon spells. Results are not encouraging; Hroki will never use them, regardless of skill level or perks added. So I scrapped the summons idea and reverted her back to pure destruction.\r<br />Â \r<br />Additionally, I noticed in earlier builds Hroki would spam Lightning spells to the exclusion of all other types. This annoyed me, so I got rid of them. Now Hroki alternates between frost and fire as I originally wanted.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE: Have released optional module, turning Hroki into a warrior tank build. New save recommended, or at least one where you haven&#39;t met her yet; changes to npcs mid game don&#39;t always carry over, as details get baked into save. Of course you could try the old &#34;disable, recycleactor, enable&#34; console commands, but I don&#39;t know how well they work. Do not use main file and optional together.",
