  "descriptionHtml": "Name: Remodeled Armors with Lorecraft and on NPC\r\nAuthors: hexenhaus\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\n- ALL credits for the great \\\"Remodeled Armor\\\" mod goes to MAK07\r\n- Thank\\'s to ArcaneSmith for his innovative \\\"Lorecraft - acquire learn manage crafting recipes\\\" and for making the Lorecraft-Tut ;)\r\n- Big thanks to Caliente for creating \tCalientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition -CBBE- & Bodyslide\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI dont like my crafting menue overcrowded, but i like the Lorecraft-concept of finding recipes and toggle books for activation of recipes. As well i wanted random NPC\\'s to wear the mod\\'s armors. So i created Lorecraft-books for each armor type of Remodeled armor and added the armors to, i hope almost all lvledlists. \r\n\r\nThis is NO Armor-replacer, as i added the armours to their respectively  lists and sets. For example a thalmor can wear the normal \\\"ArmorElvenLightCuirass\\\" as well as the \\\"000ArmorElvenLightCuirass\\\"(Remodeled Armor-mesh).\r\n\r\nThe idea behind the mod was, beside of purging the crafting list, to add more diversity to the armors. As MAK07 provided us with a \\\"substitution with vanilla armors\\\".esp, i wanted to keep KillerKeo\\'s Skimpy Armors, so i decided to make both mods (vanilla or vanilla replacer and Remodeled Armors) equal.\r\n\r\nThe chance for npc`s to wear Remodeled armors is minor to vanilla armors, as the lists contain sometimes  several of the same armors and i added only one remodeled to any lists. But as there are lists for rare/high items the chance for finding highlvl items, like glass, dragonbone or ebony armors is slightly increased.\r\n\r\nIf you find more bugs or you like the idea of my mod please leave comments or endorse me, so that i am motivated for some bugfixing or adding of new ideas =) \r\nAtm i think about adding BBP-support to Remodeled Armors... hmm\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCrafting:\r\n\r\nAll Armors are craftable with the corresponding recipe-books and the appropriate skills at any forge\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\n- Lorecraft - acquire learn manage crafting recipes by ArcaneSmith (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9959)\r\n- Remodeled Armor CBBEv3M by MAK (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13004)\r\n- Calientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition -CBBE- by Caliente (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666)\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\n1.
