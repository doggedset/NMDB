  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=4]Fort Dawnguard Dining Table Cleaned[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]Description[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />I always wondered why the main dining table of Fort Dawnguard was such a mess, every other room of the fort looks somewhat organized except that table.\r<br />Even in the official Dawnguard trailer the dining table looks fine... so what happened?\r<br />This mod aims to clean up the dining table and add bunch of different drinks and foods for the vampire hunters to enjoy. I mainly used similar items and foods which were also found in the other rooms of the fort.\r<br />I&#39;m aware that there are other mods which clean up the dining table but they all seem to overhaul the entire fort more or less. I needed a mod which only cleans up the dining table so I made this and decided to share it with you guys :)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]Installation[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />There are 2 versions you can choose from (hey, you gotta have options). Initially I made the table cluttered with food and drinks then later I thought maybe\r<br />I should cut back a bit. So in the end I decided to add a less cluttered option.\r<br />\r<br />Simply download either option you prefer and drop the .esp file into your Data folder and activate it from SkyrimLauncher.\r<br />\r<br />If you have recently visited Fort Dawnguard and then activated this mod, the table will most likely still look like a mess since the old assets are still there.\r<br />You can either wait for a few days until the cell resets and the old items on the table disappear.\r<br />Or you can use the console command &#34;resetinterior xx001dba&#34; (without quotation marks). You need to replace the &#34;xx&#34; with the number which dawnguard is at in your load order, for example it&#39;s fourth in my load order so it&#39;s &#34;04001dba&#34; for me.\r<br />I also recommend you take any items you might have stored somewhere in the fort before using this console command.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]Uninstallation[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Delete the .esp file\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Compatibility[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Obviously it will conflict with any other mod that changes or adds anything to the dining table at Fort Dawngurd.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]Requirements[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Dawnguard DLC\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Version[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />1.0 - Intial Release\r<br />1.1 - Added couple of candlesticks on the table of less cluttered version.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]Notes[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Cleaned with TES5EDIT (Just in case)",
