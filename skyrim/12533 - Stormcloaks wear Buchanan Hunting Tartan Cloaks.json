  "descriptionHtml": "March 26th Update Deployed - Hood now works for both beast races, Khajiit and Argonians should now be able to wear the hood with no problems. This should be my final update. But never say never.\r<br />\r<br />March 23rd Update Deployed - I believe I solved the texture problem. By simply making my own texture set, the Hooded Black Robes for example no longer suffer from the problem. Everyone should download the update, simply copy and replace the old files.\r<br />\r<br />March 23, 2012, Update Announced - I am in the process of doing an update on this mod that will fix a few problems with my original mod. As it stands now, certain robes such as the Black Hooded Robes, have the tartan texture attached to them. You&#39;ll also notice in some areas there are instances of some random mages wearing the hoods. This is caused by the texture replacing all variants universally. My goal for later in the day is to simply make the texture independent to the stormcloaks and the stormcloaks only. See you guys in an hour or so....\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE&#33; Fixed an alpha channel problem I overlooked when I first uploaded the file. Now transparency works as it should. Also uploaded some new screen shots.\r<br />\r<br />Did it ever bother you that the Stormcloaks never wore... well, Cloaks?\r<br />\r<br />I took the liberty of removing the Stormcloak Helmet and then replaced it with the Monk hood. I took it one step further, with permission from Callaghan04 and Armdude, I added my personal variation of their Buchanan Tartan Armor, and applied the plaid texture to the Monk hood so it would match.\r<br />\r<br />This is a REPLACER&#33; If you anticipate that you may not like this mod, I STRONGLY suggest that you backup your Textures folder.\r<br />\r<br />To install, unzip to your data directory.\r<br />\r<br />To uninstall, delete the Textures folder and restore your backup.\r<br />\r<br />Mod was made by Matt6sic6, partial credit goes to Callaghan04 and Armdude for supplying the original textures.
