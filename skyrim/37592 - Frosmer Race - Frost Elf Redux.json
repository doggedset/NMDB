Their homeland has melted due to climate changes. \r\nCreatures of Ice, they are immune to Frost. They are skilled in Archery and Duel Weapons. \r\nStealth is their game, so trickery is in order. \r\nThey have been known to hold great magic and even on some cases, \r\ncausing self corruption as Necromancers. \r\nSo... Will you be at one with the frost, or melt away with thoughts of destruction? \r\n\r\nThis is not an update of the original mod. \r\nIt has been entirely recreated, with new textures, effects and features. \r\nYou can use custom hair mods with this race. \r\n\r\nFeatures: \r\nGlowing Body Tattoos and Facial Complexions. \r\nAdded some hair that is usually unplayable. \r\n\r\nAbilities: \r\n100% Resistance to Frost (Sorry no Overpowered Features) \r\n\r\nRace Skill Bonuses: \r\nArchery 10 \r\nOne-Handed 10 \r\nDestruction 5 \r\nSneak 5 \r\nSpeech 5 \r\n\r\nSpells: \r\nCounjure Frosmer Bow - A pale blue glowing Bow and Arrows that light up dark areas. \r\nSummon Frostmane - A frosty horse with frost trails. \r\nSummon Frostmere - Arvak style frosty horse with frost trails. \r\nSummon a Frosmer Cat - Can be mounted, also is frosty with frost trails. \r\nCall of the Frosmer - Frost Night Eye with Invulnerability. Makes you more frosty with frost trails. \r\n\r\nAll the spells can be found in the Power category of magic. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments feel free to post. \r\nPlease do not ask me to change anything, as I like it the way it is. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this mod and the new Frost Elf Appearance. \r\nCredit goes to Guffeh, for permission to use his wings mesh.\r\n\r\nIf you want your most EPIC screenshots of your Frost Elf on this page, \r\nSend it to: demonrace@live.com.au or Post a Link. \r\n\r\n-MontyX \r\n",
