How could you even believe that there is a big civil war ongoing in Skyrim, when there aren't any battlefields that show the brutality of war? This mod adds several battlefields to Skyrim, some big ones and also some smaller ones.\n<br />\n<br />Currently adds XX battlefieldsÂ throughout Skyrim. More will come with future updates.\n<br />\n<br />These are located in different locations, some you will come by automatically when following the main story, guild quests and so on. Some you may only encounter when exploring the world. I've added some clutter and also some weapons, to keep performance fine I decided to not add too many objects.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]INSTALLATION\n<br />[/b][/size]",
