  "descriptionHtml": "Come one, come all, to the greatest mod on Earth&#33; Yes, that&#39;s right, shekels are finally here&#33; I know, you can hardly contain yourselves, but please wait until I&#39;m done to cream your pants.\r<br />\r<br />What does this mod do?\r<br />\r<br />- Changes the name of &#34;gold&#34; to &#34;shekel&#34;\r<br />- Changes the name of &#34;coin purse&#34; to &#34;shekel pouch&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Originally, I had planned to go full retard and put the merchant on the coin as well, but that&#39;s a lot of work and I&#39;m too lazy to go through with it.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />place &#34;shekel.esp&#34; in the Data folder, then you will become a good gentile.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall:\r<br />\r<br />remove &#34;shekel.esp&#34; from the Data folder, then you will go back to being a filthy goyim.\r<br />\r<br />I supposed I ought to throw down a disclaimer of some sort: No offense is intended by this mod, it&#39;s a joke that I made for myself and decided to throw up here as well.\r<br />\r<br />Other: I know there&#39;s a mod on the steam workshop that does the same thing, but it only affects the coins iirc, which is only half the battle. I doubt I&#39;ll add any updates to this, unless I bother to learn how to change the UI on the inventory screen to say shekels instead of gold as well. Also, I had no idea what this General Sam/Shekelstein is before making this mod, if you&#39;re wondering, the idea came through divine inspiration. Finally, feel free to do what you wish with this mod, it&#39;s none of my business anyway, just throw some credit (if applicable) is all I ask.",
