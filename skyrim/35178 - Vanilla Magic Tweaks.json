  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img826/4933/un8z.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img812/6328/dpm3.png[/img][/center][size=3]You can choose between four versions of [color=#8C99C2][i]Detect Life[/i][/color] and [color=#8C99C2][i]Detect Undead[/i][/color] spells. The main reason behind these changes is to have your hands free to equip another spells or weapons to make your kills easier. The toggle versions have 5 minutes duration, if you cast the spell again while it is already active, it will be dispelled; the tweak version have a 20 seconds duration. Sample pictures have the [url=http://www.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27043]Enhanced Lights and FX[/url] mod active.[/size]\r\n\r\n[center][url=http://imageshack.us/a/img585/9931/bojq.jpg][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img820/747/1np.png[/img][/url][url=http://imageshack.us/a/img594/8580/xd7f.jpg][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img585/2976/4j8w.png[/img][/url][/center]\r\n\r\n[size=3][color=#8C99C2][i]Clairvoyance[/i][/color] is now a fire-and-forget spell and can be toggled too. It has the same behavior as the detect spells, the tweak version has a duration of 5 seconds. The purpose in changing this spell is to have a convenient trail to your quest while you ride a horse.[/size]\r\n\r\n[center][url=http://imageshack.us/a/img138/909/reb7.jpg][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img138/4081/0jb2.png[/img][/url][url=http://imageshack.us/a/img96/7408/fbg5.jpg][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img841/2033/up8t.png[/img][/url][/center]\r\n\r\n[size=3][color=#8C99C2][i]Candlelight[/i][/color] spell has the same behavior as the toggle versions of the previous spells. You can choose different types of light. The following pictures shows the effects of the spell in different settings, the left part of the pictures are taken from the vanilla game, and the right part is using the [url=http://www.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27043]Enhanced Lights and FX[/url] mod, if you like to have samples without this mixing, check the nexus gallery.[/size]\r\n\r\n[center][url=http://imageshack.us/a/img198/1610/sgqd.jpg][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img194/6287/6ngw.png[/img][/url][url=http://imageshack.us/a/img600/479/zbbm.jpg][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img35/7010/nhnk.png[/img][/url][url=http://imageshack.us/a/img542/1885/ox95.jpg][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img51/3699/murw.png[/img][/url][url=http://imageshack.us/a/img580/281/s3pm.jpg][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img9/5852/kafg.png[/img][/url][url=http://imageshack.us/a/img34/2041/sjx1.jpg][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img20/797/04h9.png[/img][/url][url=http://imageshack.us/a/img13/4724/tre4.jpg][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img856/5285/bzqy.png[/img][/url][/center]\r\n \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img571/7205/eywa.png[/img][/center][size=3]Every tweak is on separate ESP file, this gives you the flexibility to install only the stuff you really want.[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=3]I recommend installing this mod with [color=#CCCCFF][i]Nexus Mod Manager[/i][/color], but if you are installing it manually, just extract into your [color=#CCCCFF][i]skyrim/data[/i][/color] folder the features you want installed.[/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img713/1989/ysm2.png[/img][/center][size=3]After a successful installation, wait from 10 to 20 seconds the first time you run the game and you will be ready to go.[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=3]You have to buy the spell tomes to start using the spells, the names of the spells are:[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=3][color=#8C99C2][i]Detect Life Toggle[/i][/color] or [color=#8C99C2][i]Detect Life Tweaked[/i][/color][/size]\r\n[size=3][color=#8C99C2][i]Detect Undead Toggle[/i][/color] or [color=#8C99C2][i]Detect Undead Tweaked[/i][/color][/size]\r\n[size=3][color=#8C99C2][i]Clairvoyance Toggle[/i][/color] or [color=#8C99C2][i]Clairvoyance Tweaked[/i][/color][/size]\r\n[size=3][color=#8C99C2][i]Candlelight Toggle[/i][/color][/size]\r\n\r\n[size=3]You can find merchants at the same place of the native spells.[/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img19/6247/vuxc.png[/img][/center][size=3]To increase compatibility, this mod adds its own resources to the game. The light used for the [color=#8C99C2][i]Candlelight[/i][/color] spell is custom made, new magic effects were added for every spell of this mod, the spell tomes are added to the game merchants by script and have different names.[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=3]Compatible with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286]T3nd0s Skyrim Redone[/url], just make sure it loads after [color=#CCCCFF][i]\\\"SkyRe_Main.esp\\\"[/i][/color].[/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img694/5590/r1wi.png[/img][/center][center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img534/3320/q0m2.png[/img][/center][size=3]The vanilla spell uses the [color=#CCCCFF][i]\\\"MagicLightLightSpell01\\\"[/i][/color] light, but this light is used for other stuff too, so any changes to that light will affect other parts of the game. To prevent this from happening, I added a custom light just for the [color=#8C99C2][i]Candlelight Toggle[/i][/color] spell, leaving the vanilla light alone. By making this modification, maintaining multiple versions of the spell became a nightmare, so I round up the installation options, different durations for the spell were removed, sorry.[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=3]The toggle script is really short and simple, you don\\'t have to worry about overloading the game.[/size]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img543/9985/hbv0.png[/img][/center][size=3]The changes to the detection spells, [color=#8C99C2][i]Detect Life[/i][/color] and [color=#8C99C2][i]Detect Undead[/i][/color], were made just to make them viable for the auto cast feature of another mod I made. Now you can use these versions if you consider the toggle versions overpower.[/size]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img62/6587/cjbj.png[/img][/center][size=3]I had some problems with these spells. First, the magic effects are attached to everyone else except the player, so there is no easy way to dispel the [color=#8C99C2][i]Detect Life[/i][/color] or [color=#8C99C2][i]Detect Undead[/i][/color] spells. Second, if I reduce the duration of the magic effects to either spell to be less than 20 seconds, everything falls apart.[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=3]It is hard to explain, but this is how the toggle versions works, when the player cast the spells, in fact is casting a management spell for the real detect spell, this manager will be auto casting the real detect spell every 5 seconds and will be managing the toggle feature of the spell too. This is why sometimes it takes a while for the spell to dissipate after deactivating it. Now, as I mentioned before, I cannot reduce the duration of the magic effects without breaking down the spell, so I had to leave the magic effects duration to 20 seconds, but I attached a little script to the magic effects to auto dispel after 5 seconds, the only downfall is, if you save the game when the spell is active, at the time you load that file, the magic effects attached to everyone will last 20 instead of 5 seconds, it is just a minor bug, and I hope it works for everyone.[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=3]When I was testing my detection toggle spells, my stealth gameplay became overpower, looking for a way to balance this problem, I increased the magicka cost to maintain the spell active, but then I came up with the idea of putting a small delay in the auto cast function of the management spell, this creates a detection intermittence, like the motion detector in the aliens movies, I highly recommend this option if you want an immersive gameplay. If you don\\'t like this behavior, you can choose other versions of the spell at the installation. Remember, if you want to reduce the magicka cost of these spells, you have to achieve [color=#CCCCFF][i]Adept Rank[/i][/color] in the [color=#CCCCFF][i]Alteration Tree[/i][/color] for the [color=#8C99C2][i]Detect Life[/i][/color] spell and [color=#CCCCFF][i]Expert Rank[/i][/color] for the [color=#8C99C2][i]Detect Undead[/i][/color] spell.[/size]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img38/3356/ple8.png[/img][/center][size=3]It has the same origin as the previous spell. But now it is just there if you like a hint and not a complete trail to your destination.[/size]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img850/5117/0396.png[/img][/center][size=3]I use the same technique as the detection spells, there is a management spell that is going to be auto casting the [color=#8C99C2][i]Clairvoyance Tweaked[/i][/color] spell every 5 seconds, the management spell will be responsible for the toggle features as well. To prevent the player from abusing the spell and using it as a GPS guide the entire game, I added an extra magicka cost for maintaining the spell active. This handicap is optional, at installation you can choose the 1x cost option and forget about the extra magicka cost, or you can spent some perk points to achieve [color=#CCCCFF][i]Apprentice Rank[/i][/color] in the [color=#CCCCFF][i]Illusion Tree[/i][/color].[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=3]I added an auto dispel in the [color=#CCCCFF][i]\\\"OnHit\\\"[/i][/color] event, just in case you get into a fight while traveling to your quest.  Every time I got into the fight, my enemies did some free damage on my character while I was deactivating the spell, now you don\\'t have to worry about this scenario.[/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img571/7720/97h2.png[/img][/center][size=3][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/43123]Smart Cast[/url][/size][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/43123][center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img28/8852/3o2f.jpg[/img][/center][/url][size=3]Use SkyUI to get new alternatives to cast magic spells, give it a try if you are looking to improve you magic casting gameplay.[/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34795]Learn Alchemy From Recipes[/url][/size][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34795][center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img24/1527/40i9.jpg[/img][/center][/url][size=3]Would you like your alchemy recipes to be more useful?, try this mod.[/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][url=http://www.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27043]Enhanced Lights and FX[/url][/size]\r\n[size=3]This mod creates a more dramatic and realistic mood to the Skyrim lighting.[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=3][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5312]Acquisitive Soul Gems[/url][/size]\r\n[size=3]The way soul gems should behave, give it a try, you won\\'t be disappointed.[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=3][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31799]Traps Make Noise[/url][/size]\r\n[size=3]You must have this mod if you want a better experience.[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=3][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26116]NONSTOP Firewood Chopping[/url][/size]\r\n[size=3]Your character will keep chopping firewood until interrupted, really cool if you want to make a sandwich while your character is left chopping firewood.[/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img546/1599/lhs7.png[/img][/center]\r\n[b][size=3]Author:[/b] [color=#BBFF77]NeoRunek[/color][/size]\r\n[b][size=3]Special Thanks to:[/b] [color=#BBFF77]Zeitz[/color][/size]",
