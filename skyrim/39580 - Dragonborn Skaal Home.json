While the backstory is aimed at an archmage character, it works for any build and gives you one more warm bed for those cold Solstheim nights.\r<br />\r<br />[heading][color=#99FFFF]Features:[/color][/heading]\r<br />[list][*]Direct access to Severin manor through the basement.\r<br />[*]Alchemy and Enchanting in main house\r<br />[*]Slightly maze like* basement that&#39;s half in Apocrypha (no tentacle attacks or black water).\r<br />[*]Unique set of Stalhrim Gear.\r<br />[*]Unique spell.\r<br />[*]Full crafting facilities and additional storage in the basement&#39;s &#34;panic room.&#34;\r<br />[*]Fully Navmeshed with idle markers.\r<br />[*]Chair on the roof and tons of other easter eggs.\r<br />[*]Cooking gear.\r<br />[*]Mannequins/bookshelves/weapon racks.\r<br />[*]Tons of storage (only un named sacks are unsafe, all else is safe).\r<br />[*]Lore Friendly.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[line]\r<br />[center][size=2]UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES MAY THIS MOD BE DISTRIBUTED IN WHOLE OR IN PART VIA STEAM WORKSHOP OR ANY PAID DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL. \r<br />If you paid for it the person you paid stole it.\r<br />[/size][/center]\r<br />[line]\r<br />[heading][color=#99FFFF]Update Notes:[/color][/heading]Do not update if your current save is in either the Skaal Village (including, obviously, the home itself) or in Severin Manor. Raven Rock exterior should be safe, but feel free to get out of town first if you&#39;re feeling paranoid. [heading][color=#99FFFF]Known Issues:[/color][/heading][list][*]ALL SACKS (except the Apothecary satchel) and MOST CRATES & BARRELS DO RE-SPAWN&#33;&#33;&#33; I figure my sandboxing companions must eat things and re stock them, so I&#39;ll probably leave it that way\r<br />[*]Weapon Racks may get stuck, duplicating your item and making it a permanent mount. Followed the official tutorial, please give feedback on how to fix)\r<br />[*]AFT followers do not see the area as &#34;home&#34; and will equip their &#34;standard&#34; outfit. If anyone knows how to fix this please let me know, it doesn&#39;t seem to be a &#34;player owned vs player faction owned&#34; or &#34;public Area&#34; thing.\r<br />[*]The basement&#39;s exit to Severin Manor is NOT LINKED TO THE QUEST and is UNLOCKED BY DEFAULT\r<br />[*]The house is player owned and unlocked by default, no quest or dialogue for it ATM\r<br />[*]The basement exit to Severin was supposed to be an &#34;extending hallway&#34; but I can&#39;t figure out the triggers for it; as a result the auto load door going into Severin is a bit abrupt.\r<br />[*]The incredibly cool and quite useful Daedric Dawnbreaker mod emits really really strange squares of light on the walls when used in the Skaal Village home. Possibly due to the number of light sources and the increased imagespace dropoff.\r<br />[*]Followers sometimes do not cross the door threshhold into the &#34;panic room.&#34; once inside they can snadbox and navigate and leave properly. Should be fixed in next update.\r<br />[/list][heading][color=#99FFFF]Backstory on the Home&#39;s Original Occupant:[/color][/heading]A Nord Mage from Skingrad fled to Solstheim where he became allied with the Skaal. Sharing much about alchemy and magic with the Shaman, and helping defend the town from Reavers; he quickly became a local hero. When word reached him that the Thalmor were looking to &#34;Question&#34; him on his activities both in Skyrim and back south, he fled to keep the Skaal people safe. Before he left, he triggered a small avalanche, burying his home. This bought him time, and made it appear that the Skaal had reason to want him gone, the &#34;accident&#34; that caused the avalanche being a threat to the town. By the time the Thalmor dug their way in to his former abode, he was already far away. They pursued him, but that is a story for a different time.[heading][color=#99FFFF]Known Conflicts::[/color][/heading]None. Anything that changes the area immediately behind the Shaman&#39;s Hut is likely to conflict; as is anything that alters the area directly next to the forge in Severin Manor.[heading][color=#99FFFF]Compatible With:[/color][/heading]It has been optimized to fit in with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31167/?]Severin Manor Improvements[/url] by uglydemon but this amazing mod is not required or utilized in any way other than checking the door&#39;s position in game with that mod enabled. If you choose to use the Severin Manor Improvements mod, load this mod after as it should not conflict and will put the door in its appropriate location no matter what state Severin Manor is in[heading][color=#0A122A]Shameless Self Promotion:[/color][/heading][color=#DF7401]Fallout New Vegas:[/color]\r<br />[color=#DF7401][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/56045/?]JOANA COMPANION[/url][/color]\r<br />[color=#DF7401][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/55818/?]SKYNET COMPANION[/url][/color]\r<br />[color=#DF7401][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/55736/?]EMILY ORTAL DOCTOR COMPANION[/url][/color]\r<br />[color=#DF7401][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/46982/?]ASSASSIN&#39;S ABODE[/url][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#088A08]Fallout 3:[/color]\r<br />[color=#088A08][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/20710/?]MOIRA BROWN COMPANION[/url][/color]\r<br />[color=#088A08][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/20497/?]ANTAGONIZER COMPANION[/url][/color]\r<br />[color=#088A08][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/20163/?]THE VAULT DWELLER&#39;S STASH[/url][/color]\r<br />[color=#088A08][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/20202/?]PIP BOY UPGRADE MODULES[/url][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#086A87]Skyrim:[/color]\r<br />[color=#086A87][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/39580/?]DRAGONBORN SKAAL HOME[/url][/color]\r<br />[color=#086A87][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52282/?]CRAFTMEISTER GEAR[/url][/color]\r<br />[heading][color=#99FFFF]Obvious Disclaimer:[/color][/heading]\r<br />Seeing as the area in which the house is built is on Solstheim which only exists in the Dragonborn DLC... this requires Dragonborn. Yeah, I know, but I&#39;m saying it anyway :)\r<br />\r<br />[heading][/heading]\r<br />* I originally built an actual maze. But once the pure Minecraft like joy of making it wore off, I realized it was a huge hassle for the player. So I scrapped it and went for something that FEELS a bit like a maze instead. There are two forks in the road, one leads to a dead end. The dead end is very easy to avoid once you have found it. You will want to go all the way to the end of the dead end one time anyway :) Once you have gone back and forth between the two houses once or twice, you will find it impossible to get lost. The level design makes it feel like a slightly magic basement that Hermaeus Mora had a little fun with and the backstory in the journal entries makes it (almost) make sense.",
