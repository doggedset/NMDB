  "modName": "Damage Reduction heavy armor",
  "summary": "feel like your not getting enough of a return on your heavy armor skills? easy mod that makes all that armor rating beyond the cap a useful investment.",
  "descriptionHtml": "we all know that skyrim\\'s armor works by means of a equation that pumps out a percent that the incoming damage has removed. at an armor rate of around 500 something, this percent caps out and leaves you with about 85% damage reduction, so you only take 15% of the damage and that seems okay until you notice that the armor rating continues to climb and provides no further protection and that doesn\\'t seem right.  This mod adds another layer of protection onto the percentage one provided normally by generating a number based on your armor rating and subtracts said number from the damage you would normally take, possibly negating all damage taken to zero is you have a high enough armor rating. The mod currently only works for heavy armor, because....well, it\\'s heavy armor, but if I get enough feed back, I might expand it to work for light armor.\r\nupdate:\r\ndue to a small oversight in my modding, the conditioned perk hindered magical effects that were beneficial, but the issue has been resolved in the newest version.\r\nThe Run Down\r\nthis is how you get your invincibility working.\r\nJuggernaut 1: gain damage reduction equal to 2% your armor rating\r\nJuggernaut 2: gain damage reduction equal to 4% your armor rating\r\nJuggernaut 3: 6%\r\nJuggernaut 4: 8% \r\nJuggernaut 5: 15%\r\ncushion: knock 10% of your armor rating off fall damage\r\nconditioned: reduces damage from magic by 50% and then knocks off 10% of your armor rating in damage.\r\nso yeah, tell me if it works for your game and tell me what ya think. First mod, would really like feedback\r\nsome current bugs in the system, like health draining when unarmored and attacks healing damage, have been reported...currently working on it.",
