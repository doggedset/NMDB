  "descriptionHtml": "I love immersion and RP and I started a hunter character for myself playing as Alvor and Sigrid\\'s eldest daughter. As I played away I started to run into little problems so I made a mod which fixes most of them.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you like and don\\'t like how I can make this better. I\\'ll try to accommodate.\r\n\r\nAfter a few attempts I have decided that I am not going to make a male character. The males are too weathered and they don\\'t really look very young without installing mods which will effect every male in the game which isn\\'t worth it to me. You are free to do so yourself though.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------0.72 Update--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nMore bug fixes and tweaks\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------0.71 Update--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick hotfix of my own stupid error, Sorry to those who downloaded 0.7 :< I havn\\'t had a lot of time for testing this week.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------0.7  Update-------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral bugs fixed\r\nWorking bookcase Added\r\nStorage renamed appropriately\r\nStealing from storage removed (Sigrid no longer calls thugs on you)\r\n(I spent way too much time on silly bookcases this week to get much else done)\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------0.6 Update--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nAt night time you get locked out of your own house so I added your own key.\r\nChests and barrels no longer have a re-spawn timer so belongings are safe.\r\n          Container\\'s now updated to require family key\r\nAdded a couple more container\\'s around the place.\r\nDummy Weapon rack replaced with real one next to Alvor\\'s Works.\r\nExtra seat at the table for the new addition to the family including food and plate.\r\nInterior Navmesh cleaned up to function much better than vanilla. (what were they thinking).\r\nAn extra bed installed downstairs.\r\nFamily surnames implemented to suit the saved character\\'s name.\r\nStunning young beginner hunter re-scaled and meekly armoured for the role of eldest child.\r\nTimescale set to 5\r\nCrosshairs Disabled\r\nSet to Master Level\r\nExtra idle spots added for NPCs\r\nMore to come....\r\n\r\nCompatible with any other mod that doesn\\'t effect Alvor\\'s house interior.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------RP-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI was born and raised in the small village of Riverwood. Father Alvor is the village Blacksmith.   \r\n\r\nTimes are hard, more so lately as I heard a rumour that bandits had recently moved into the mine father collects ore from. I have been told very harshly that I am not allowed near that mine so it must be true as it was never a problem before.  I used to enjoy playing hide and seek in there with Sven when we were younger. He was never any good at finding me. \r\n\r\nFather would never admit it to his children but I looked in his ore container yesterday and he is down to his last few. If only the guards would come and do something about those bandits.\r\n\r\nI think secretly father always hoped for a son but was cursed with two Daughters. When I was growing up he always tried to show me how to work a forge but I was always small for my age. I definitely never had the strength to be hitting metal with that heavy hammer all day. I don\\'t know who will tend the forge after father gets old. Maybe Dorthe\\'s Husband will when she is older. It won\\'t be mine. I\\'m never getting married!\r\n\r\nI\\'ve just turned 16 the other day and father gave me a bow for my birthday. He showed me a little how to use it but said I should practice some more on tree\\'s and things. I might ask Faendal if he can teach me a little. I know he is always busy working for Gerdur though and can be quite short with me when I pester him, he is never in a very good mood lately. Maybe because there aren\\'t any other elves for him to talk to here. \r\n\r\nI can\\'t practice hunting in the forest either. Father says a bear has been sighted near by and hasn\\'t been killed yet. I need to be able to hit this tree from far away before I start practising on bears.\r\n\r\nCousin Hadvar came home today! He seems hurt and was limping a little. He was talking privately with father about something but I wasn\\'t allowed to listen. I hope he is ok. Everyone was so proud of him when he went off to join the Legion. One day I hope to join too when I\\'m older. I will be able to go and see the world just like him. Maybe we can go together. It\\'s been such a long time since he has been around and I have missed him terribly.\r\n\r\nFirst I need to learn how to use this bow though. Maybe soon I can bring some food home to help the family. I was trying to practice but Dorthe keeps pestering me. I might have to sneak off a in the morning to practice just a little further away. I\\'ll be ok if I\\'m quiet. Bears are too big to sneak up on people I think.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------REQUIREMENTS-------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t want the save you DO still need to pick Hadvar at the start or you will be trespassing and stealing from the containers.\r\n\r\nFor the save to look like mine you need....\r\n\r\nDimonized Body @ http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6709\r\n\r\nBetter Females @ http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812 (makeup version 1)\r\n\r\nCute freckles @ http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=515\r\n\r\nNo More Blocky Faces @ http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=30\r\n\r\nCover eyes 1 @  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4869\r\n\r\nThe fur outfit is a replacer @ http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=461\r\n                 (If you don\\'t add this you will just be wearing regular fur) \r\n\r\nThat should do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------KNOWN BUGS---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAlvor\\'s surname won\\'t change yet.\r\n\r\nSometimes character resized when crafting and sleeping etc. To fix this open the console and type \\\"player.setscale 0.87\\\" without quotations\r\n\r\nWoodcutter\\'s Axe does not work on Weapon Rack\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IMMERSION MODS-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nThese are not required in any way but are absolutely amazing.\r\n\r\nBetter Villages @ http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10411\r\nNOHUD Compass @ http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=1914\r\nLorecraft @ http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9959\r\n            (Requires Jaysus Swords @ http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=1002 )\r\nImps More Complex Needs @ http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10639\r\nWars In Skyrim @ http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6176\r\n            (Set to Dark Rainbow but turn off heroes and Villains all together cause it just kills all\r\n             your villagers at low level, I often advance my health and stamina a little to cope)\r\nQuality World Map Classic version @ http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4929\r\nFrostFall @ http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11163\r\nWarzones @ http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9494\r\nThe list could go on and on but I have to stop somewhere\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------INSTALLATION-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nManual\r\nAlvorFamilyHome.esp placed into C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\r\nSaved Game placed into C:\\\\Users\\\\#####\\\\Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Saves",
