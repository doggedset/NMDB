  "descriptionHtml": "This is just a small overhaul for Solitude, giving it a victorian-era vibe. Some of the textures are from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77809/?]Clockwork by Antistar[/url]. Additional resources provided by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/150026]Ga-Knomboe Boy[/url].Â Also included in the download are two optional ESPs. One, called Industrial Solitude, adds functional smokestacks to most of the buildings in Solitude. The other, Solitude Carpenters, adds a new building near the market in Solitude, just to fill in some empty space and make the city feel more alive. The interior is pretty simple and about what you would expect. I would recommend combining it with Books of Skyrim for a nice lightweight Solitude Overhaul.\r<br />\r<br />Overall, the resulting aesthetic fits Solitude much better in my opinion. Stuffy, refined, upperclass, cosmopolitan, forward thinking, mercantile, aristocratic.",
