  "descriptionHtml": "[size=48pt][color=yellow][b] Teldryn Sero\\'s Twin Brother Endryn [/b][/color][/size]\r\n\r\n[b]Requires Dragonborn DLC[/b]\r\n\r\nDid you get excited when you met Teldryn Sero but then suffer the disappointment of not being able to marry him?  Well you still can\\'t but you can marry his identical twin brother, Endryn!\r\n\r\nEndryn Sero is almost exactly like his brother Teldryn except as with most siblings they do have a slighly different voice (such a shame I know).\r\n\r\nEndryn fights like his brother, levels like his brother and comes equiped with a set of Dark Brotherhood Armour (because it looked fantastic on him!)\r\n\r\nHe can be located in the Bannered Mare (Whiterun).\r\n\r\nDownload with Nexus Mod Manager and place him low in your mod order.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
