  "descriptionHtml": "Compilation mod is released, freckles have migrated there as well. That will be the one I support.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48705/?]RaceMenu Overlay Compilation[/url]\r<br />\r<br />A while back I converted Rost3&#39;s fantastic [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15766/?]freckle body textures[/url] to a RaceMenu overlay so I could use it independent of my skin texture. He recently got back to me granting permission to share it, so here it is.\r<br />\r<br />There are two overlays, one for the body that adds freckles to the shoulders, chest and back area and a face overlay that adds freckles around the neck to prevent a noticeable seam. The neck freckles turned out kind of subtle in RaceMenu so they may need to be applied a few times, &#39;stacking&#39; them to make them stand out relative to the body texture.\r<br />\r<br />Should be compatible with all body types.\r<br />\r<br />Requires [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?]RaceMenu[/url] to be installed of course. *Make sure you install &#34;Loose Base Scripts&#34; otherwise the texture menu may show up empty.*\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Drag mod contents to Data folder, or install with mod manager.\r<br />\r<br />All credit for the texures goes to Rost3 for going above and beyond in providing the source files for his freckle texture.\r<br />Further credit to Expired6978 for Racemenu and the documentation provided with it.",
