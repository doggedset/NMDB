This mod is compatible with any hair texture replacer, e.g AOF Believable Hair, so it will look different on each system. \r<br />\r<br />This mod requires the Dawnguard DLC, or else you will get a CTD when launching Skyrim.\r<br />If you find bugs, please report them in the comments, as I will check them every day and I&#39;ll try to provide as much support as I can. \r<br />\r<br />Thank you for downloading, enjoy, and be sure to endorse this mod if you like it&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Cheers, \r<br />       pwner69.",
