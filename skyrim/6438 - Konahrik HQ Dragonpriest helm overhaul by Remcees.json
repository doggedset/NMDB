  "summary": "This mod replaces the original Konahrik texture with a HQ better looking one!",
  "descriptionHtml": "Check out my other mask retexture, but beware I have only done so much texturing, so there might be a difference between this one and the old one.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5934\r\n\r\nAS FOR THIS MOD.\r\n\r\nIt replaces the standard texture, which was kind of simple for such a possesive item, with a 1024x1024 texture. With that I gave it a whole overhaul.\r\n\r\nTo install; Place this in your skyrim folder ewhich will probably be something like this:\r\n\r\nC:\\\\ProgramFiles\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim or something\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been asked before, so I will announce: This is my last dragonpriest overhaul for now. Do not expect any new ones in the near future!",
