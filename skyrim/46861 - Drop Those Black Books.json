  "descriptionHtml": "[color=&#34;red&#34;]***IMPORTANT***[/color]\r<br />Do not use this mod before you have completed all activities within Miraak&#39;s temple. There is a chance it will prevent you from initiating conversation with him when you read Waking Dreams. I don&#39;t know what causes this, so be careful when installing this mod.\r<br />\r<br />Fed up with lugging about these bulky and heavy tomes everywhere I went, I decided to do something about it. This is a simple fix that makes each of the Black Books droppable. They should now behave like any other book when you aren&#39;t reading them for the free perks from Mr Mora. This should be compatible with pretty much any other mod out there (I don&#39;t know how it will interact with other mods that allow you to drop these books, though).\r<br />\r<br />This is a simple mod and it&#39;s going to stay simple.",
