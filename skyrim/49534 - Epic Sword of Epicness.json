  "descriptionHtml": "The Epic Sword of Epic Epicness is truly an Epic Sword indeed.  Crafted from a very secret (and absurdly simple recipe) that has made it&#39;s way, as if by magic, into the mind of the Dragonborn, this unassuming looking Great Sword may be all that stands between you and death.  However with this sword in hand, even Death would be afraid.\r<br />\r<br />In one swing it may Paralyze an opponent as it inflicts Fire, Frost and Shock damage while simultaneously Draining and Damaging their Magicka.  It absorbs their health and stamina replenishing any lost by the weilder before finally they expire.  When this happens, and providing you have a large enough soul gem, it will also trap their souls for future use.  It can also Turn the undead and make them flee from you (provided the live long enough to do any running).\r<br />\r<br />All of this and it wastes no magical energy...\r<br />\r<br />Truly an Epic Sword indeed.",
