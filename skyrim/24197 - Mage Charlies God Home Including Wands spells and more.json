More magic&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Please Endorse if you like.\r<br />Updates\r<br />\r<br />13/01/14 Added a new spell, Blizzard which last longer kills more and has fire damage. Changed the textures on the wands.\r<br />I am trying to get in my own wands into the game, Ive made a simple one in Blender but cannot for the life of me get in into Nif or Skyrim. If anyone knows how to do this and could help I would give credit.\r<br />\r<br />10/01/14 Ha I figured out how to make a wand, So ive uploaded it for you. I will make some more once I figure out how to remodel the shiv.   To install now just drag the both the files into the main game folder ie. D:SteamSteamAppscommonSkyrim it will ask you to merge the files say yes. Done&#33;\r<br />\r<br />09/01/14 A few tweaks here and there, Added some more spell books and some Nightingale armor with new Enchantments.\r<br />\r<br />06/01/14 Added some Powerful Staffs for your pleasure, Will take down most enemies in seconds, If not one will set them on fire the other electrocute them for 60 seconds. And the Third is (which is hidden in the house) well you will find out.\r<br />\r<br />06/01/14 Added some more spell books  one is a basic flame but very powerful. The Other is... Well fun to use&#33; But use it with Caution around Allies.
