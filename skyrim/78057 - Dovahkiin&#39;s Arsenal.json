  "summary": "The armor the Dragonborn of the Skyrim covers. I grew tired of not being able to play the Dragonborn in the trailers and screenshots by Bethesda due to game mechanics and the base stats of the armor, and made adjustments.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I wanted to portray the Dragonborn of the trailers and screenshots by Bethesda in several of my game-plays, but due to the limitations and game mechanics of the particular armor set the Dragonborn is meant to wear in-game that was impossible without the experience being infuriating.\r<br />\r<br />Thus I made this mod, which adds a set of armor and weapons which the Dragonborn is shown to use in the trailers and screenshots. The stats are equivalent to Dragonbone, and they can be crafted in the Daedric category, and require the equivalent perk to upgrade.\r<br />\r<br />Alternatively, you could use the console and give yourself the items, seeing as the Dragonborn is supposed to have these from the get-go.\r<br /> (( I&#39;m assuming.)) Just search &#34;Dovahkiin&#39;s&#34; with the help command and the item codes will display.\r<br />\r<br />At the moment the set is only heavy and light but if people like the mod and it is requested I could make an unarmored version too possibly.\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t believe it would require any DLC&#39;s to function, and the change is so minimal ((yet so needed IMO)), that it can&#39;t possibly do any damage to the performance of your game. I seriously doubt there are any bugs as well.\r<br />\r<br />just download as usual and follow the aforementioned tips on how to obtain it.",
