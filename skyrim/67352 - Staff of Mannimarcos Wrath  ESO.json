  "descriptionHtml": "  Trolhetta is a large mountain on the border of Skyrim, Cyrodiil and Morrowind, located approximately where the Jerall, Velothi and Valus Mountains meet.\r<br />\r<br />The mountain has changed hands many times over the centuries. In the early First Era, it belonged to a Chimer clan, who built an extensive Daedric shrine on its peak. In the middle Second Era, Trolhetta was considered a part of the Rift region in Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />In 2E 582, the summit of Trolhetta was the site of the battle between the forces of the Ebonheart Pact (including Jorunn the Skald-King and the Vestige) and the Worm Cult, led by the fused spirits of the legendary giant Sinmur and Thallik Wormfather. The battle was won by the Pact forces, which ended Sinmur&#39;s threat to the Rift.\r<br />\r<br />Access to the mountain was through a cave in the southeastern corner of the Rift. No trace of this cave remained by 4E 201.\r<br />\r<br />                    Until  now  &#33;\r<br />\r<br /> Surviving Worm Cultists are trying to reopen this passage and in doing so have found a unique artifact.  The Staff of Mannimarco&#39;s Wrath.\r<br /> This staff shoots skulls of ice and fire. Upon the ground, ice...If a target is hit, fire.\r<br /> Can you claim this mighty prize for your own ?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br /> Please enjoy the mod and do not upload elsewhere or use assets without permission, Thank you &#33;",
