  "descriptionHtml": "This is something I made as a prank to a friend. All it does is edit 10 of the most common lines from guards and \\\"cleans them up\\\" with an appropriate bleeping out of some choice words. I don\\'t plan on expanding upon this, plus if I did too many lines it\\'d be unbearable. \r\n\r\nBonus points to the first person to post all the edited lines (note, all of them are general except two, one is early main quest related and the other is gender and event related). \r\n\r\nNote I only edited male guards, didn\\'t feel like shuffling though the thousands of files for a few select needles twice.
