  "descriptionHtml": "[b]What does the mod do?[/b]: The mod makes the pickpocket perk &#34;poisoned&#34; more useful on higher levels. In vanilla skyrim the chance of placing a poison in the target pocket is determined by the value of the poison. I changed it so you have a 90% chance no mater what the poison vale is. (not OP since poisons don&#39;t do much damage in vanilla skyrim)\r<br />\r<br />I made this mod because I could not find any similar mods on the nexus. If there is a similar mod please send me a message. This was for personal use and i thought it would be nice to share it with everyone.\r<br />\r<br />[b]How to install[/b]: Just use mod manager or place the esp manually in the data folder if you like it that way Â :)\r<br />\r<br />[b]How to uninstall[/b]: Delete the better poisoned perk esp file.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Compatibility[/b]: I am not sure if the mod will conflict with other mods that alter pickpocket perks since I don&#39;t use them. (If you have the time you can test it and share it in the comments with other.)\r<br />\r<br />I recommend some mods that make poisons last longer or do more damage for more fun.",
