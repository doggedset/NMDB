  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a new spell to the game.\r\n\r\nEssentialy this is an improved version of the equilibrium spell already in the game. I changed the visual effects a little, and made it drain 33.33 health for 66.66 magicka, making it a one to two ratio. This makes the spell (in my opinion) much more viable than equilibrium, while still retaining that sense of danger. I find it perfect to use with my vampire necromancer.\r\n\r\nYou can find the spell at the end of the Ilinalta\\'s Deep, which can only be accessed if you have finished or are on the quest from Azura. I\\'m sure you understand why I thought this was a fitting location, and if you don\\'t, you\\'ll see why.\r\n\r\nInstallation is simple, just plop it in your data folder, or use the mod manager.\r\n\r\nThis is compatible with absolutely everything. I made sure of that.",
