  "descriptionHtml": "The player can use either Azura\\'s Star or the Black Star to upgrade the atronach forge in the College of Winterhold\\'s Midden. The upgraded forge can grant infinite charges to a variety of unique weapons. Place either star in the pedestal. In the offering box, place a daedra heart and either a filled black soul gem or a filled grand soul gem with your weapon of choice. Pull the lever.\r\n\r\nSupports Skyrim-only, Dawnguard, Dragonborn, and Dawnguard+Dragonborn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKNOWN ISSUES\r\n\r\nI designed this mod to conflict as little as possible. That said, there are some unavoidable problems with this kind of endeavor. \r\n\r\n\t1) I rewrote the atronach forge scripts, so any mod that also makes changes to those scripts will conflict. As far as I know, no mod does this, so I wouldn\\'t worry. Any mod that adds recipes to the forge will be compatible, however. \r\n\r\n\t2) Any weapon you choose to craft will lose any tempering (ie, your \\\"Legendary Volendrung\\\" will become a base \\\"Volendrung\\\" again). This is unavoidable. Fortunately, I made new tempering recipes, so you can go re-temper any weapon. \r\n\r\n\t3) If you use a mod that replaces the weapon\\'s model with a new model from a non-default directory (for example, InsanitySorrow\\'s Unique Uniques), the NEW weapon will not reflect that mod\\'s changes. The vanilla weapons, however, will be left modified. Your options: a. simply play with that vanilla weapon and limited enchantments, b. make a patch (very easy to do), c. ask me politely to make a patch. Same goes for any mod that changes the base values of a weapon - weapon speed, damage, etc - texture and enchantment changes should be fine, though.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDEAS\r\n\r\nIf you\\'d like to see support for another weapon added from Skyrim, Dawnguard, Dragonborn, or a popular mod, please ask, but I won\\'t guarantee I\\'ll do it. Same goes for any patches with regard to Section IV part 3.\r\n\r\nI implemented this mod as finely-detailed as possible. That means, for instance, The Black Star and Azura\\'s Star operate with different recipe and result lists. Currently, the ins+outs are identical, but in the future that doesn\\'t have to be so. This could allow for consequences for choosing either The Black Star or Azura\\'s Star (because right now who doesn\\'t choose The Black Star?) For example, breaking Azura\\'s connection to the star could lock the player out of upgrading any other daedric artifact. Using the Black Star could add a soultrap enchantment to any created item. Ideas. If you like the above ideas, have ideas of your own, whatever, let me know.\r\n\r\nObviously, this mod is a psuedo-cheat mod thinly veiled as a gameplay enhancement mod. Considering that this mod doesn\\'t simply change all the current weapons and requires a certain cost, even if it\\'s not that dire, I felt that gameplay categorization was warranted. If you have an idea to balance this more properly, by consuming a Star in the process of upgrading a weapon (for instance), and there\\'s enough demand for it, I\\'ll probably do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCURRENTLY SUPPORTED WEAPONS\r\n\r\n----SKYRIM\r\n\r\nBlade of Woe\r\nBolar\\'s Oath Blade\r\nChillrend\r\nDawnbreaker\r\nDragonbane\r\nEye of Melka\r\nMace of Molag Bal\r\nMehrune\\'s Razor\r\nNightingale Blade\r\nNightingale Bow\r\nPale Blade\r\nRed Eagle\\'s Bane\r\nRueful Axe\r\nSanguine Rose\r\nSkull of Corruption\r\nStaff of Magnus\r\nvolendrung\r\nWabbajack\r\nWindshear\r\n\r\n----DAWNGUARD\r\n\r\nAetherial Staff\r\nAuriel\\'s Bow\r\nHarkon\\'s Sword\r\n\r\n----DRAGONBORN\r\n\r\nBloodscythe\r\nChampion\\'s Cudgel\r\nDwarven Black Bow of Fate\r\nHoarfrost\r\nMiraak\\'s Sword\r\nMiraak\\'s Staff\r\nSoulrender",
