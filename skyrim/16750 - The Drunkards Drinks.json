  "descriptionHtml": "THE DRUNKARDS DRINKS v1.00\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nThis mod adds 27 new magically infused alcoholic beverages to the game. The drinks are spread across Skyrim in various towns and taverns. Upon drinking, each beverage gives the player a permanent \\'active effect\\' bonus of some kind. e.g. Hearty Hops - +10 Health. When in the players inventory, all of the drinks sit under the \\'food\\' tab. \r\n\r\nThis mod is meant to provide some challenge and entertainment and as such the player must use their mind to find the magical drinks. A book titled \\'The Drunkards Book\\' can be found somewhere in The Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood. This book contains various rhymes/poems riddles and clues regarding the location of the drinks.\r\n\r\n“Various alcoholic beverages infused with magical properties have been spread out across the cities and towns of Skyrim. The drunken wizard who created them has left a book containing clues on where to find them at The Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood.”\r\n\r\nFor anyone who wants the locations of the drinks given to them or for anyone who is having trouble finding one of the drinks here is a video that reveals the locations of every drink\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHfdmsjNNmA\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n\r\n1. Place the esp file and BSA Archive in your Skyrim/Data directory.\r\n2. Enable the esp file in the Skyrim Game Launcher or equivalent.  \r\n\r\nThat\\'s it!  :)\r\n\r\nProper Drinking etiquette \r\n\r\n1. Drink a beverage taking note of the bonus it is meant to give.\r\n\r\n2. DO NOT OPEN inventory for a few seconds, when you drink one of the drinks it adds an active effect for a second or two. After this effect wears off a new effect should be added to your active effects tab in the magic menu, this is the permanent bonus...Sometimes if you open your inventory too fast the first temporary active effect might still be in effect. If this is the case close your inventory wait for the active effect to end, then the permanent one should be added to your active effects tab.\r\n\r\n3. Check your active effects tab, looking for the name of what the drink increases, e.g. If you drank Titan on Tap, look for a \\\"Fortify Heavy Armour\\\" effect under the active effects tab, when you put your mouse over this active effect the name of the source should show as Titan on Tap.\r\n\r\nThis is the first mod I have made that has reached the upload stage...\r\nIf it\\'s not too much trouble, please give me feedback.\r\nBe sure to let me know about any issues or bugs you encounter (hopefully there won\\'t be many if any)\r\n:)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nFatalisticZero\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nList of drinks and effects\r\n\r\n27 Drinks total\r\n\r\n>Attributes<\r\n\r\nHearty Hops          - +10 Health \r\nGreen Fairy          - +10 Stamina \r\nMystical Mead        - +10 Magicka \r\n\r\n>Combat Skills<\r\n\r\nBarbarian Beer      - +5% Two handed Damage\r\nSamurai Sake        - +5% One handed Damage\r\nCenturion Cider     - +5% Damage Block \r\nDeadeye Daiquiri     - +5% Damage with Bows \r\nThe Anvil            - Improvements on armour and weapons are 5% better \r\nTitan on Tap         - +5 Heavy Armour skill\r\n\r\n>Stealth Skills<\r\n\r\nBrewers Brew         -Created Potions are 5% better\r\nBards Brandy         - Prices are 5% better \r\nRogues Rum           - Sneaking is 5% better \r\nSwindlers Swill      - Pickpocket Success is 5% better\r\nLocks of Lager      - Lockpicking is 5% easier\r\nFeathery Flip        - +5 Light armour skill\r\n\r\n>Magic Skills<\r\n\r\nReshaping Red        - Alteration Spells are 5% cheaper to cast \r\nThe Spawn            - Conjuration Spells are 5% cheaper to cast \r\nThe Apocalypse       - Destruction Spells are 5% cheaper to cast \r\nEnchanted Elderberry - +5 Enchant skill\r\nPhantom Punch        - Illusion Spells are 5% cheaper to cast  \r\nThe Rejuvenator      - Restoration Spells are 5% cheaper to cast \r\n\r\n>Resistances<\r\n\r\nBlazing Bourbon - +10 Fire Resistance\r\nNippy Night Cap - +10 Cold Resistance\r\nMagnetic Mead - +10 Shock Resistance\r\nThe Wall - +5 Magic Resistance \r\nThe Panacea - + 20 Disease Resistance \r\nSnakebite - +20 Poison Resistance\r\n\r\nMy other mod(s)\r\nDepraved - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23714",
