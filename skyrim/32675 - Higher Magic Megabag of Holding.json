  "descriptionHtml": "Ever run out of space? Ever really want that really nice toy, but know that you would have to waddle out of the ruins at a half inch a minute to get it back to town? No more. \r\n\r\nMegabag of Holding is an upgrade to my Multibag of Holding mod. \r\n\r\n- 42 different magical bags of holding available with a single spell for access. \r\n- The Boxes are sorted into categories for ease of use.\r\n\r\nWeapons : Ammo, Archery, Blade, Blunt,Staff,Misc\r\nArmor : Light, Heavy, Cloth, Jewelery, Misc1, Misc2\r\nConsumeables : Food, Ingredients, Potions-Restore, Potions-Assorted, Misc1, Poisons\r\nReadable : Scroll, Book-Normal, Book-Special, Misc1, Misc2, Misc3\r\nMisc : (Craftable & Clutter Submenus)\r\n\tCraftable : Smithing, Leatherworking, Enchanting, Building, Misc1, Misc2\r\n\tClutter : Dwarf, Tableware, Storage, Kid, Worthless, Misc\r\nSpecial : Favorites, Loot, Stolen, Quest, Misc1, Misc2\r\n\r\n- Has a sorting process to rapidly transfer things to and from the boxes, available on opening the box in question.\r\n- Has 2 copies of it in the world. \r\n: 1 in Breezehome  (Free of charge) \r\nFor those that use a modified breezehome, don\\'t worry, there is another\r\n: A small barrel in the corner of Windhelm that has copies of the spells as well. \r\n\r\n-Has 2 spells.\r\n1) To access the bags normally. Able to be equip in either hand, no problem. \r\n2) A Quicksort that will rapidly sort categories of items (all consumeables, all clutter, etc...) It is set up as a lesser power, and can be set up as a voice usage.  This does NOT open the boxes... It simply does it in the background, and lets you know when the sort is done.  It automatically puts the items in the normal, corresponding boxes so you can access them later with the other spell. \r\n\r\n=====\r\n\r\nNotice : \r\nI have done a bit of work, and while it isn\\'t perfect, it is good enough for most things.  I have MULTIPLE VERSIONS of this Available. \r\n\r\nBase : Base Skyrim... No mods\r\n- DG : Base Skyrim + Dawnguard mod. Both of these are in the form lists for sorting.\r\n- DG DB : Has both Dawnguard and Dragonborn put into the lists for sorting. \r\n- Full : Has Dawnguard, Dragonborn, and Hearthfires in the lists. \r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t have the right one, that is fine. Any of the lower ones will work with the higher ones, they just won\\'t have the other items in the lists. It means you have to click the items accordingly on your own... Easy enough. :)\r\n\r\n=====\r\nPackrats Rejoice... Your saving grace is here! :) ",
