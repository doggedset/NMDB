  "descriptionHtml": "ATTENTION! This mod has been incorporated into the USKP.\r\n\r\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n\r\nYea! My second mod, so here goes:\r\n\r\nAt first, I thought that the Dwemer had a really cool magnetic war axe that magically clung to my armor, but then I realized that Bethsoft just let it slip by QC.\r\n\r\n\r\nI made this a couple of months ago so I don\\'t remember exactly how I did it. All I remember is that the ring was there, just not associated with the axe, I had to use NifSkope for the 1st time ever, and that the whole process was a pain in the rump!\r\n\r\nBut hey, it\\'s the little things that make a game great.\r\n\r\nPermissions:\r\nAnyone can use my mod for their own purposes as long as they give me credit for my work and most importantly, they provide me with a link \\'cause I\\'m always on the prowl for new mods!\r\n\r\nAbsolutely do not upload my mod to any other site, especially Steam and its affiliated garbage. \r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nAll content, edited or otherwise, is assumed to be the original property of Bethesda Softworks and the file(s) posted here under the screen name \\\"ViperMkII\\\" are not-for-profit.\r\n",
