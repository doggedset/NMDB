  "summary": "A simple character preset to create Annikae the blind Bosmer.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I was piddling around in Skyrim one day when I thought \"How would it impact my gameplay to RP a blind character?\" Thus, I created Annikae. She was one of my best games, but one of my mods got corrupted and I lost the ability to continue. I still had the (corrupted) save though, and I managed to create a preset (and, hopefully coming soon, a custom follower) out of the wreckage.\r\n\r\nThis is my very first time uploading any mods anywhere, so I'm not an expert by far. I don't know how it works but THIS PRESET MAY REQUIRE CBBE. I was also using ApachiiSkyHair at the time but since she uses a vanilla hair I think you're fine there.\r\n\r\nThe screenshots I've uploaded myself include the following mods downloaded right here on the Nexus and I highly recommend all of them:\r\nAlternate Start - Live Another Life\r\nWest Wind Combat Series - Misfit Mage\r\nWest Wind Combat Series - Assault Armor\r\nCloaks of Skyrim\r\nTemptress Race - Temptress Complete\r\n\r\n",
