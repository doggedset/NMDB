  "summary": "Patch to forward Requiem perks and deleveling to Wyrmstooth. Based on the NRM patch.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I was unable to directly convert the NRM patch for Wyrmstooth so I made one essentially from scratch. I'm not an expert in Requiem mechanics or the Wyrmstooth mod, so I just took the edits from the NRM patch and forwarded those changes while leaving out things that seemed obviously bugged, or invalid references considering the original patch was made for an old version of both Wyrmstooth and Requiem.\n<br />\n<br />This was made entirely in SSEEdit and is completely untested. There may still be balance issues but it at least works, delevels the NPCs and adjusts stats to be closer to Requiem in design.",
