  "summary": "New music with periods of none",
  "descriptionHtml": "This adds some of TES music and other games that I\\\\\\'ve accumulated over the years of gaming, but also throws in periods of no music at all.  Skyrim doesn\\\\\\'t seem to give any real pauses.  This mod will not remove the Skyrim music, but only adds the above. \r\n\r\nThanks to this mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13286/?tab=3&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmodimages%2F%3Fuser%3D0%26id%3D13286 which made mine possible.  He stripped out the tree folder which lets us easily insert our own music.  Bethesda used to make it easy to add tracks, but not any more.  My mod simply uses his with my own tracks.  \r\n\r\nExtract this folder into your Data folder. For STEAM users, that path is probably: C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data   and place the \\\"ISP\\\" esp into the same folder and (of course) activate it.
