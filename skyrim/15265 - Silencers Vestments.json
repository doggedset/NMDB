The cloth version requires no smithing skill and is of course at 0 armor. The light armor version requires glass smithing and is comparable to glass armor. The heavy armor version requires ebony smithing and is comparable to ebony armor. The replacer version replaces every instance of dark brotherhood armor, and as such is found everywhere the default armor is found.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use the console to get the armors, these are the names:\r\n\r\nSilencer\\'s Braced Vestment\r\nSilencer\\'s Braced Boots\r\nSilencer\\'s Braced Gloves\r\nSilencer\\'s Vestment\r\nSilencer\\'s Boots\r\nSilencer\\'s Gloves\r\nSilencer\\'s Mask\r\nSilencer\\'s Hood\r\nSilencer\\'s Hooded Mask\r\n\r\nAnd in the replacer version:\r\n\r\nBraced Shrouded Armor\r\nBraced Shrouded Boots\r\nBraced Shrouded Gloves\r\nBraced Shrouded Cowl\r\nBraced Shrouded Masked Cowl\r\nBraced Shrouded Mask\r\nBraced Shrouded Robes\r\nBraced Shrouded Shoes\r\nBraced Shrouded Hand Wraps\r\n\r\nSo if you wanted to see the ID for the braced version, you would type -help \\\"silencer\\'s braced\\\"- without the -- and it would show IDs for the braced vestment, boots, and gloves.
