  "descriptionHtml": "[color=deeppink]=====DESCRIPTION=====\r\n\r\nThis mod is a texture replacer (initially) for the \\'crest\\' on the Full Imperial Helmet; originally black, I changed it to the \\'imperial\\' red color present on all imperial attire. As with most of my mods, I acknowledge the simplicity of this retexture, however, the helmet just didn\\'t look right with a black crest and I have done my best to make the helmet look as authentic as possbile. \r\n\r\n\\\"Love the idea, much better than a metal blade on top.\\\"\r\n\r\n\\\"EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR with Red thing on the helmet !\\\"[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=Chartreuse]=====INSTALLING=====\r\n\r\nNOTE: You can download it with the Nexus Mod Manager if you so choose, and there will be no need for installation.\r\n\r\nI have chosen not to include a ReadMe with this mod, as it is a very simple texture replacement. Please take a few seconds here to read up on the process. Once you have downloaded and extracted the mod, simply place the folder named \\\"textures\\\" into your Skyrim \\\"Data\\\" folder. For most of you, this will be: \r\n\r\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=DeepSkyBlue]=====UNINSTALLING=====\r\n\r\nTo uninstall this texture replacer, simply enter the \\\"Data\\\" folder in your Skyrim directory, then enter \\\"textures\\\" and \\\"armor\\\" then delete the folder named \\\"imperial\\\". Please remember to leave constructive feedback on un-installation.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=orange]=====PLEASE NOTE=====\r\n\r\nThis mod [i]replaces[/i] the texture of the Full Imperial Helmet so - as long as this mod is installed - you will not encounter an original version.\r\n\r\nPlease remember to comment with ideas and criticisms!\r\nNow, download, install, and enjoy!
