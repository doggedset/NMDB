  "descriptionHtml": "Knight\\'s Steel Armor version 1.0\r\nA MOD for TES V: Skyrim by LieutenantHawk\r\n\r\nI was somewhat disappointed with Skyrim\\'s armor sets, since the majority of them don\\'t cover the whole body. It doesn\\'t make much sense, since half of the province is frozen over. Also, being an Argonian, I get cold easily. I was really excited when I found the Steel Plate armor; it had a cool-looking Medieval design and left nothing exposed. However, it wasn\\'t perfect, so I decided to modify it for myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n--{Features}--\r\n\r\nA retexture of the armor, boots and gauntlets of the Steel Plate set. The fur parts and dull bluish cloth are replaced with chainmail, the engravings are smoothed out, and the color is tweaked.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 1/3/2012: I have done the female armor and helm now. A file has been uploaded with all of the textures, including the new ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n--{Installation}--\r\n\r\nCopy the \\\"Textures\\\" folder into your \\\"Skyrim\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\" folder. If you are prompted to overwrite files, say \\\"yes.\\\" \r\n\r\n\r\n--{Bugs/Conflicts}--\r\n\r\nObviously, it\\'s not compatible with any other Steel Plate retextures.\r\n\r\n\r\n--{Copyright}--\r\n\r\nNo distribution or alteration without my permission.\r\n\r\n\r\n--{Credits}--\r\n\r\nBethesda Softworks for making Skyrim, of course. 1000carlos for the Real Steel Plate Armor retexture that this one is inspired by. Otherwise it\\'s all been me.\r\n\r\nTo contact me: The most obvious would be via Skyrim Nexus, but I am also on deviantART and Yahoo under the same name.\r\n",
