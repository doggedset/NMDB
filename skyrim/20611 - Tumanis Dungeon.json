  "modId": 20611.0,
  "modName": "Tumanis Dungeon",
  "summary": "Custom Dungeon for any mod developer or editor to use! This mod gives you a Dungeon which you may edit, republish, or use for your own mod. Only condition is: You must give me credit. Other then that, go crazy!",
  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/2uj6b.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[b]HOW DO I GET IN?:[/b]\r\n\r\nIn-Game you can either type \\\"coc Tumanis\\\" in the terminal, or alternatively you can go to the physical entrance which is located in the woods somewhere. Inside the creation kit, to access the cell, simply find \\\"Tumanis\\\" and double click it. And on Tamriel the exterior is conveniently called \\\"TumanisExterior\\\".\r\n\r\n[b]PERMISSION?:[/b]\r\n\r\nIf you are to use this for your own mod or edit, you may. But please credit me as the original creator of the Dungeon (no matter how much you\\'ve modified it).\r\n\r\n[b]INSTALLATION?:[/b]\r\n\r\nUse ModManager for the easiest installation. Otherwise, save the file to your desktop and \\\"Add mod from file\\\".\r\n\r\n[b]PLANNED UPDATES:[/b]\r\n\r\nI plan on adding updates to Tumanis on a regular basis, although if you prefer a previous version they will also be available for download. Below is the planned next update (v3)\r\n\r\n*Nothing planned yet, leave suggestions in comments?\r\n\r\n[i][u][b]NOTE:[/b][/u][/i]\r\n\r\nI cannot stress this enough, on its own this Dungeon would suck as a mod. I HIGHLY encourage you to play with it and make it better. The intention is to give modders and editors a baseline to work from and improve and not have to start from scratch.",
