Prides of Lions inhabit Skyrim&#39;s Whiterun Hold, Reach, and Eastmarch. They live in their dens and lairs complete with bones, blood, and dead stuff. Panthers are rare and solitary animals and inhabit the swamps of Hjaalmarch.  Their lairs are often used to hide in and decorate them with prey that they store in the trees, the tiny population of Tigers occupy the forests of the rift they a ruthless killers and man-eaters there lairs are full of body’s of many a man (endorse to help in there conservation :P) and finally Scar who inhabits Pride Rock and is the Alfa male for the biggest pride in skyrim, it is said his roar can knock and man flat and his teeth are as sharp as daedric steel. Beware&#33;\r<br />(If you want to find the Lions look at the map in the images section or look ingame for the map marker location “Pride Rock” just above Rorikstead )\r<br />There are 75 Lions, 228 Lionesses, 17 of the rare Panthers, 4 of the rare Tigers and 1 Scar all custom-placed with patrols and idle markers. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=gold]--- Normal Version ---[/color]\r<br />Lions, Lionesses, Panthers, Tigers are now all LVL (levelled) creatures except for scar because he is a boss, (this change is because of high demand for weaker lions that level with the player – request of hundreds of comments) low level players are still advised to avoid the prides but they are no longer impossible to beat (I can beat a pride at lvl 15 on master difficulty so you should be fine) lions are now about as strong as giants, lionesses substantially weaker than giants, panthers somewhere between the lions and lioness and finally tigers who also as about strong as giants.\r<br />\r<br />[color=gold]--- Hard Core Version (Classic PoS) ---[/color]\r<br />Lions, Lionesses, Panthers, Tigers and Scar are all assigned the ENC (encounter) value, which means that you can encounter them at any time, regardless of your level. Lions are level 50, Lionesses are level 40, Panthers are level 45, tigers are level 55 and Scar is Level 60 so they are very powerful for anyone under level 40, and they are almost never alone.  It&#39;s best you sneak around them&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Skyrim&#39;s Lions use classic hunting techniques to hunt and take down prey. They will strike quick and fast, and then circle and repeat. This makes it very hard for you to focus your fire on just one. It also means they occasionally smack into each other... \r<br />Skyrim’s Panthers are one of Skyrim’s rarest big cats. They are ambush predators and hide in the bushes around their lairs waiting for something unfortunate to walk by.  Even though panthers are solitary they are still a force to be reckoned with, they are faster than a lion and are know not to tire easily.\r<br />Good luck navigating the outdoors, and I hope you enjoy this mod&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=gold]-----New in v1.3-----[/color]\r<br />* Lions are now lvl (normal version)\r<br />* Lioness are now lvl (normal version)\r<br />* Panthers are now lvl (normal version)\r<br />* Panthers have a new mesh (short teeth and tail, no longer is a sabre panther)\r<br />* New Creature: Tigers with new mesh and texture (placement still WIP)\r<br />* Tigers are now lvl (normal version)\r<br />* New location: “Pride Rock” highly detailed custom dungeon with a boss inside (bring a torch)\r<br />* New Creature: Scar, a lion boss with new texture and unique attacking ability’s \r<br />* Major balancing changes lowered health of everything (normal version)\r<br />* Added 2 Lions, 8 lioness and Scar to Pride Rock Dungeon  \r<br />* Added 4 Tigers\r<br />\r<br />[color=gold]-----New in v1.2-----[/color]\r<br />* Lions have a new mesh (they now have a Mane, short teeth and a lion tail)\r<br />* Lionesses have a new mesh (they now have short teeth and a lion tail)\r<br />* Lions have some new sound effects\r<br />* Lionesses have some new sound effects\r<br />* 5 new lion dens have been added to the tundra areas of Hjaalmarch and the Reach\r<br />* Added 7 lions and 20 lionesses\r<br />\r<br />[color=gold]-----New in v1.1-----[/color]\r<br />* New creature: Panthers\r<br />* Moved the pride outside Rorikstead to fix collision with the ‘reserve’ mod \r<br />* Slight balancing tweaks lowered male Lion health\r<br />\r<br />[color=gold]-----Overview-----[/color]\r<br />* New creature Lions with new textures, new meshes and new sounds\r<br />* New creature Lionesses with new textures, new meshes and new sounds\r<br />* New creature Panther with new textures and a new mesh\r<br />* New creature Tiger with new texture and a new mesh\r<br />* New creature Scar Lions with new textures, new meshes and new sounds\r<br />* 75 custom-placed Lions\r<br />* 228 custom-placed Lionesses\r<br />* 17 custom-placed Panthers\r<br />* 4 custom placed Tigers\r<br />*2 custom placed Scar’s\r<br />* 1 Unique highly detailed custom dungeon  \r<br />* 64 custom-built lairs/dens\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=gold]---- RECOMENDED MODS&#33;&#33;
