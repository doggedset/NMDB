  "descriptionHtml": "[b][center][size=4][color=#ffff00]For anyone checking out this page: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70194]This mod has been completely rebuilt&#33;[/url] \r<br />\r<br />This version will work as advertised for users of VTF, and I will keep it available for people \r<br />who want vampire NPC&#39;s to use a custom skin texture. However, now that I&#39;ve had more \r<br />experience with modding, I have come to the conclusion that VTF is bad news. Its edits to \r<br />the vampire race record cause an incredible variety of compatibility issues, and this mod \r<br />only scratches the surface in terms of fixing it. \r<br />\r<br />There were also a lot of things I could have done better when I first made this, and rebuilding \r<br />it from scratch was the only way to put it right. I&#39;ve done the same thing I did here, but in \r<br />a way that does not rely on race edits OR custom textures. It is now an extremely basic NPC \r<br />overhaul with much wider compatibility, restoring the human appearance of Dawnguard vampires \r<br />and also making them all a little bit hotter, because we all know vampires need to look hott.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#fff2cc]I remade every Vampire NPC in Skyrim.

My mod is basically one huge compatibility patch for VTF and Dawnguard, smoothing out a ton of little problems that kept the game from properly recognizing those custom texture paths. Now EVERY VAMPIRE is specifically tailored to work with VTF, and as a bonus, they each got a little makeover. [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Again, VTF is not strictly required in order to run this mod, but - ironically - it&#39;s going to have a bit of trouble with VANILLA texture paths. I&#39;m not sure, but you might be able to hammer it into shape by perfectly replacing every possible vampire-related texture with your regular human body/face textures. If you try it, let me know how it works out.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#ffe599][size=4]A patch is available for users who don&#39;t have Dawnguard...[/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=5]IT&#39;S CALLED DAWNGUARD&#33; [/size]\r<br />[/color][color=#ffe599][size=4]Get it.

That&#39;s practically all this mod IS.[/size]\r<br />[size=3]We&#39;re talking about 140+ NPC&#39;s here, and I&#39;m not doing them over, ever. This took F---ing forever. [/size]\r<br />[size=3]Thank you for understanding.[/size]\r<br />[size=2](It&#39;s funny how I said this back then, and then did it.)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />You have my permission to make your own mod that puts different hair on different NPC&#39;s&#33;[/center]Here&#39;s the story, the &#34;why&#34; if you will: A while ago I downloaded the excellent Serana overhaul [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38326/?]Seranaholic[/url], and then further customized Serana with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/42049/?]Porcelain Vampire Skin[/url]. Her new look was ghostly pale with bright yellow eyes. Very cool Vampire look, but suddenly every other vampire NPC in the game looked like a different species... with Dawnguard&#39;s &#34;butt face&#34; effect. The mismatch bothered me, so I downloaded [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31136/?]VTF [/url]in an effort to turn all the other vampires pale, yellow-eyed, and un-butt-faced. \r<br />\r<br />It didn&#39;t quite work, though, really through no fault of the mod authors involved. My game had old facegen data rattling around in its subfolders, giving every vampire a nasty body/face mismatch. It seemed to be a common problem for VTF users.\r<br />\r<br />I knew the only real fix was to re-export the facegen data of EVERY VAMPIRE after ensuring that their body and face textures looked right with VTF loaded. I figured, as long as I was manually inspecting/fixing EVERY VAMPIRE, I might as well make it fun and give them better faces and cool new hair. And really it wasn&#39;t until late in this process, when I was starting to regret ever starting it, that it occurred to me to upload it on the Nexus. Basically it took so f---ing long I figured I should save everybody the trouble of ever doing it again.\r<br />\r<br />I actually overhauled Serana too, even though I&#39;m still just going to use Seranaholic myself. If you don&#39;t use any Serana mods besides this, she&#39;ll at least fit in with the other vampires. I changed her race from &#34;Nord&#34; to &#34;Nord Vampire&#34; and fixed the VTF texture paths.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][color=#fff2cc]Other Mods I have made:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59277]Blood and Silver - Cidhna Mine Expanded[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58084]Immersive Laundry[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83060]The Erotic Adventures of Misty Skye[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62338]Female Forsworn Briarhearts[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74959]Hott Interesting NPCs[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70194]Hott Vampires 2 - The Quickening[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75031]Hott Witches[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/86514]Hott Dremora[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58857]Hott Argonians[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69104]The Brotherhood of Mead[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58416]Morning Mist Mage Robes[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63477]Bigger Dragon Bridge[/url]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65163/?][img]http://static-5.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/65034-1-1430105640.png[/img][/url]",
