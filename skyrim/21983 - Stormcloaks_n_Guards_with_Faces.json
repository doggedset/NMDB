  "descriptionHtml": "---README---\r\n\r\nStormcloaks and City Guards with Faces\r\n\r\nby Dall\r\n\r\nv1.0\r\n\r\n08/08/2012\r\n\r\nStormcloak n City Guards with Faces mod replaces original Stormcloak Full Face Helmets - for open-face ones. This seemingly simple and visually reasonably small (item - armor part) exchange makes - in-game - very big difference as all these bland n faceless NPCs  now have proper faces n easily recognizable personalities. \r\n\r\nFor even more difference / better looking faces - try it with my Skyrim_Faces_NPCs mod.\r\n\r\nTo install you need to navigate to your Steam/SteamApps/common/skyrim - game folder and paste / drag n drop in it my Data (mod) folder. Allow overwrite!    \r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t like this new look, simply delete / remove my mod .esp and files from Data/meshes n textures/armor/stormcloaks and original look will be restored to your game.\r\n\r\nBugs/conflicts: None known with my lot - but if you have some other mod, which changes/uses same Stormcloak helmet chances are that NPCs face will be gone / not visible. Unfortunately due to zillion of levelled lists - used for distribution of this helmet/s - nothing further can be done for open face helmets.  \r\n  \r\nUse:\r\nFree to use but if used for modding ask me for permission!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for great game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
