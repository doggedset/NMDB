  "descriptionHtml": "After my best friend&#39;s dog Lucky died, I felt sad. So I imagined he would like to see an immortal version of Lucky, one that can still play with him in the magic world of Skyrim. And since Lucky was a white haired bastard he looked like Skyrim&#39;s default dogs, so the feeling of it is real.\r<br />Lucky is located in the Drunken Huntsman, Whiterun. In his inventory you will find two spell books. These spells can transform any NPC in a werewolf or a dog, and this is permanent. It was created to be used with Lucky, so that you can transform him into a werewolf during the toughest battles and revert him afterwards.\r<br />This mod has no compatibility issues. I use it with a ton of mods in my personal Skyrim, some affecting werewolves and companions.\r<br />If you are in need of a nice, friendly, brutal talking dog, here you are.\r<br />Remember, Lucky is balanced in combat, but is essential.",
