Don&#39;t answer that. I just found it really a bit dull, so I changed it for my own pleasure, and also so I can see which shop it is I&#39;m going to. The sign for Angeline&#39;s Aromatics is now a wood carving that to my eyes stands out a bit more. I&#39;ve left it as weathered wood, as I imagine the climate in Skyrim isn&#39;t kind to gaudily painted signs. I&#39;ve left a glowmap channel in the mesh for those using Mystical Illumination by EvilDeadAsh34, though it&#39;s set to no emission at present. If you&#39;ve got Nifskope and you want it to light up like a neon sign, go for it :)\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Drop the Meshes and Textures folders into your Skyrim/data directory, merging when asked and saying &#39;yes&#39; to the prompt to overwrite.
