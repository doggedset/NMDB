  "descriptionHtml": "--== Introduction ==--\r\n\r\n\\\" ... take it, and you\\'ll walk as a lion among sheep ...\\\" -Harkon\r\n\r\nThat\\'s quite a lie don\\'t you think? Most city guard could kill vanila Vampire Lord easily, a spit of dragon\\'s fire breath could turn Vampire Lord to dust in almost instant, and so many other.
