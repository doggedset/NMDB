  "descriptionHtml": "Way back when, I posted [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/4898545-brunwulf-free-winter-should-wear-heavy-armor/#entry42800985]this thread[/url], and with an incredibly helpful reply, it became possible for even the simplest mind to create and share this incredibly simple mod.\n<br />\n<br />What it does:  Replaces Brunwulf Free-Winter's light armor boots with steel, and adds steel gauntlets.\n<br />\n<br />My game is Merged, Bashed, &amp; Patched, but it doesn't want to load before Immersive Citizens - if his armor doesn't change, or he's in his undies, check your load order.\n<br />\n<br />If you have any issues with the mod, I'll try &amp; see what I can do, but I'd seriously recommend you make a friend that knows how to mod.\n<br />\n<br />[b]ALWAYS [/b]back-up your saves.\n<br />\n<br />Not intended for sale, and always free for all.",
