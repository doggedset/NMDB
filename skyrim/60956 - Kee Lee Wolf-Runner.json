He then ruled over Thirsk for three years until he was slain in the mead hall massacre.\r<br />\r<br />Kee Lee works well with EFF but no clue about UFO as I don&#39;t use it. You can find her at the Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun, ready to do battle and adventure along by your side, equipped with Barbarian Hunter skins and a Steel Broad Sword. Don&#39;t underestimate her by her looks she isn&#39;t very friendly.\r<br />\r<br />Of all the followers I&#39;ve created I have grown to like her quickly, who says a follower has to be a nice person, a little friction makes for interesting times. If you can stand her attitude she is Marriageable. She&#39;s a Combat Warrior and starts at level 5 and will go to 60, if you want her to go higher you can change it in the CK, if you need help with it let me know.[/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />************************************************************************************************\r<br />[size=4][b][font=Tahoma]Required:[/font][/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Verdana][size=3]ApachiiSkyHair by Apachii\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?[/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b][font=Tahoma]Essential Mods For Her Looks:[/font][/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[font=Verdana][size=3]1.Caliente&#39;s Beautiful Bodies Edition -CBBE by Caliente\r<br />\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666/?\r<br />I still use V3-2 I recommend the new version.\r<br />\r<br />2.
