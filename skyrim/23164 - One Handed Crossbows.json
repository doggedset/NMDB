  "descriptionHtml": "Finally the mod you\\'ve been waiting for is here at last! Thatâ€™s right one handed crossbows: you can dual wield them, use them with a shield, spell, or sword! this was a project being worked on by the dawnguard and the college of winterhold, a crossbow that never needed to be reloaded so you could have another hand free, and now its finished! Steel and dwarven crossbows can be bought from merchants or found throughout the world, you can find Nocturnal crossbows in Nightingale Hall and Akiviri Crossbows in Skyhaven Temple. Dragon bone crossbows can be forged with Dragon Smithing\r\n\r\n[youtube]JeZAC8Rp6bk[/youtube]\r\n \r\n\r\n[youtube]nMRjcWxXvIw[/youtube]\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\ndawnguard is required\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUpdates: \r\n\r\nV3: Added Dwarven One Handed Crossbows\r\n\r\nV4: lowered the fire rate to prevent crashing (it makes more sense this way anyways)\r\n\r\nV5: Added Nocturnal Crossbow and Nightingale bolts to the Twilight Sepulcher (in the small room extending off the worship chamber)\r\n\r\nV6 Added one handed Akaviri Crossbows, moved Nocturnal Crossbows to Nightingale Hall, and added bolt packs to recharge the crossbows (bolt packs act like soul gems for now).\r\n\r\nV7: No more CTDs! No longer disconnects when kill cams activate.\r\n\r\nV8: Now upgradeable at special workbenches added to all major cities. You can upgrade them higher depending on your overdraw perk.\r\n\r\nV9: Full Release\r\n\r\nV10: Added Dragonbone Crossbows\r\n\r\nAlso check out my new Blessings of the Madgod Mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38348/?\r\n\r\nAnimations: New animation files added, to install them unzip the file and put everything in it into: \r\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Meshes\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\animations\r\nWARNING: the animations replace the right handed staff animations, so staves in your right hand may look weird.\r\n\r\nCredits: A big thanks to 3ukalipto for the animations.\r\n\r\nNote: This mod is out of beta stage, but will still be updated with new crossbows.",
