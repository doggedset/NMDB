  "descriptionHtml": "This is currently a work in progress, some might say a beta release. When the Construction Kit is released myself and a friend are planning to create an entire quest line revolving around acquiring Mjolnir. The reason I\\'ve uploaded this weapon is because it is meant to trigger the Unrelenting force impact effect when power attacking, but when I have tested it myself it seems to occur randomly. Also, I\\'m not sure if the effect will trigger if the player does not already have the words FUS, RO, and DAH in their spellbook and unlocked. I don\\'t really have time to test it thoroughly enough by myself so if you want to help, play with the mod and leave a comment describing how the hammer worked for you. Thanks!\r\n\r\nCurrently Mjolnir is a standalone weapon and can be crafted from the Daedric smithing menu at a cost of 1 ebony ingot, 1 moonstone ingot, 1 quicksilver ingot, and 2 leather strips. it is NOT upgradable.\r\n\r\nBase stats are damage 17, weight 20, value 5000. It also holds an enchantment that deals 30 shock damage and is supposed to cause massive knockback when power attacking. It will never run out of charge.\r\n\r\nI know it\\'s overpowered but once again I would like people to give feedback so I thought you should at least have outrageous fun whilst doing it. =)\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nAn updated texture is now available. The esp is also included in the optional download, so it is not essential to download the main file if you haven\\'t already.\r\n\r\n",
