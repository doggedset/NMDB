  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ff0000][size=6][center][b]THIS IS THE FIRST SKYRIM MOD I EVER MADE. PLEASE GIVE FEEDBACK IF YOU FOUND ANY PROBLEMS OR FOUND ANYTHING UNBALANCED[/b][/center][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b]-Description-[/b][/size]\r<br />This is a patch for compatibility between Jaysus Swords and Requiem - The Roleplaying Overhaul. It rebalances the weapons and their recipes according to the standard set by Requiem, it adds meltdown recipes for recovering the materials used to make the weapons and changes the Leveled Lists to conform with the unleveled philosophy of Requiem.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b]-Requirements-[/b][/size]\r<br />Requiem and Jaysus Swords v14, which you can find at Sharlikrans Compatibility Patches page (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26230/).\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b]-Installation Instructions-[/b][/size]\r<br />When installing disable JSwords.esm and JSwordsDistributionBalance.esp as all edits from those files have already been included on the mod, you will however still need the assets from the original mod.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b]-Details-[/b][/size]\r<br />The weapons were divided into tiers equivalent to the vanilla materials, to craft them you will need the perk that would be required for that tier, a list list with the tiers each weapon was assigned to is provided below. I tried not to change the damage, reach, speed and weight of a weapon unless i had a very good reason to do it and balanced the value according to all those values and not only the damage itself, i did reduce the damage of the Dovah Luv (Dragonhilt) sword because it surpassed all other one-handed swords in the game by far, it is no tied with Miraak&#39;s Sword with damage 16.\r<br />\r<br />I also removed hand-placed weapons that the JSwordsDistributionBalance.esp added to the world and NPCs but i might add another version with them back in in the future.\r<br />\r<br />The esp file on this mod included all edits from the JSwords.esm and JSwordsDistributionBalance.esp and thereby those are not needed, but you still need to have Jaysus Swords installed because of the assets.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b]-List of included Weapons (According to Tier)-[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b]----DWEMER----[/b]\r<br />Crude Axe\r<br />Woodsman&#39;s Axe\r<br />\r<br />[b]----Orcish----[/b]\r<br />Hunting Knife\r<br />Legionaire&#39;s Sword\r<br />Norse Axe\r<br />\r<br />[b]----Elven----[/b]\r<br />Ancient Sword\r<br />Argonian Battleblade\r<br />Baskethilt Sword\r<br />Dagger\r<br />Fine Bastard Sword\r<br />Fine Iron Sword\r<br />Khajiit Saber\r<br />Knight&#39;s Greatsword\r<br />Nordic Blade\r<br />Scimitar\r<br />Shiavonna\r<br />Smallsword\r<br />\r<br />[b]----Glass----[/b]\r<br />Albensword\r<br />Ancient Nordic Sword\r<br />Bastard Sword\r<br />Boarding Knife\r<br />Crusader Sword\r<br />Gilded Norse Sword\r<br />Gungnir\r<br />Heavy Crusader Sword\r<br />Jade Blade\r<br />Legendary Corundrum Blade\r<br />Long Hunting Sword\r<br />Long Hunting Sword (Black)\r<br />Magnificent Sword\r<br />Norse Sword\r<br />\r<br />[b]----Ebony----[/b]\r<br />Akavirii Battlesaber\r<br />Akavirii Saber\r<br />Akavirii Short Saber\r<br />Akavirii Sword\r<br />Argonian Blade\r<br />Fine Crusader Sword\r<br />Fine Norse Axe\r<br />Gilded Crusader Sword\r<br />Great Norse Axe\r<br />Hunting Sword\r<br />Hunting Sword (Black)\r<br />\r<br />[b]----Daedric----[/b]\r<br />Dragonbrand\r<br />Dragonsting Sword\r<br />\r<br />[b]----Dragonbone----[/b]\r<br />Dovah Luv\r<br />Dragonbone Battleaxe\r<br />Dragonbone Greatsword\r<br />Dragonbone Sword\r<br />Dragonbone Waraxe\r<br />Dragonsting Dagger\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b]-Credits-[/b][/size]\r<br />Jaysus for the original mod including the models and textures of all weapons.\r<br />Sharlikran for version 14 of Jaysus Swords\r<br />Tabris999 for compatibility patch",
