  "descriptionHtml": "The Ring of Namira can provide great benefits to cannibals, but it\\'s really annoying to use because it opens the prompt to feed on every dead body. I\\'ve just added a check so that the prompt only opens when in sneak mode. Now you can loot corpses while wearing the ring without getting that annoying prompt constantly. This was made for a request I received. I got that request two months ago, but better late than never, right?\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=cyan][b]Install[/b][/color]\r\nUnzip the file into your Data folder and activate then using whatever mod manager you use. My data folder is located in \\\"C:/Program Files x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/\\\" and I\\'d imagine yours is something similar.",
