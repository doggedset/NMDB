  "descriptionHtml": "Farengar Secret-Fire is the court wizard at Dragonsreach in Winterhold. He frequently recommends to the player that they enroll at the College of Winterhold, even if the player has already finished that quest line. He also frequently asks the player if they have arrived because of \\\"ongoing hostilities,\\\" apparently in reference to the civil war. This mod removes both lines of dialog for a more pleasant gaming experience.\r\n\r\nMost players can avoid Farengar altogether after an initial meeting, but magic users may want to frequent his shop throughout the game.\r\n\r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=8251]This mod is also available at the Steam Workshop[/url].
