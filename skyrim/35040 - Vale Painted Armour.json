  "descriptionHtml": "[size=7][b]Vale Painted Armour[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Why?[/b][/size]\r\nI was rather sad to discover, after making my way to a cool new place called the Forgotten Vale, finding funny animals that would glow in the dark, and getting their pelts, that I could then do nothing but make regular leather.  Seemed a bit disappointing.  Thus began a learning journey with the CK and Google.  Many thanks to those who post tutorials!\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]What does this mod do?[/b][/size]\r\nOnce you have procured the Vale deer and/or sabre cat hides, you can craft a new ingredient, Vale Powder, at the tanning station.  It glows.\r\n\r\nWith your glowing powder (and a set of ordinary heavy armour) in hand, you can paint details and fancy designs that glow in the dark (also at the tanning station).\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Details[/b][/size]\r\nI tried a few different ways to get the \\'painting\\' process to work.  Unfortunately, neither the alchemy station or the armour upgrading table will work, so the tanning station will have to do.  Just pretend you\\'re holding a paint brush instead of a dagger.\r\n\r\nCurrently available armours are ebony and daedric.  For male, female, and all kinds of beasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Benefits of wearing Vale Painted armour[/b][/size]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Impress your friends and colleagues with your artistic skills.\r\n[*]Scare off enemies by pretending to be a [url=https://www.google.ca/#hl=en&safe=off&sclient=psy-ab&q=woad+warrior&oq=woad+warrior&gs_l=hp.3..0l3.321.4051.0.4182.22.13.6.3.3.0.139.1232.9j4.13.0.les%3B..0.0...1c.1.6.psy-ab.JTKggClb3vE&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&bvm=bv.43828540,d.b2U&fp=bd77088938b5e6b7&biw=1920&bih=977]woad warrior.[/url]\r\n[*]Play nice with the creatures of the Vale*, and actually be able to defend yourself when the relationship goes sour.\r\n[*]Be your own night-light.\r\n[*]Make vampires jealous.  Only their eyes glow.\r\n[*]Mix and match different designs for lots of choice!\r\n[/list]\r\n[i]*provided you have the necessary pacification spells.[/i]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Other things you might want to know[/b][/size]\r\nThis mod adds all new pieces of armour, based off vanilla armour in the CK and vanilla textures from the original game, as well as Dawnguard.  It also adds the new ingredient (which is usable as any other ingredient).  Obviously, you will need both Skyrim and Dawnguard to run this mod.\r\n\r\nThere are no known conflicts, and really there shouldn\\'t be, since nothing in the game is modified; only additions are made.\r\n\r\nThis mod works perfectly fine with my other vale mod (for light armour): [url=http://www.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33439]Vale Skin Armor[/url].  Both the powder and the leather can be created with both mods running.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Special Thanks[/b][/size]\r\nThis mod uses meshes built by MadCat221 (with permission), which can be found [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2903]here.[/url]\r\n\r\nVanilla ebony meshes are a headache to work with.  Without MadCat221\\'s meshes, this mod would never have happened.  Thank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Instructions in brief[/b][/size]\r\nDownload and extract the files from the .rar file.  Place the files into your Skyrim data folder.  Activate with your favourite mod manager.  Play.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[size=5][b]Change Log[/b][/size]\r\nv1.0\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Initial release.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nv1.1\r\n[list]\r\n[*] New Daedric armours - normal, Azura, and Hircine.\r\n[*] A slight change to the file system.  The \\'paint\\' now appears in a master file (.esm), which should come before the plugin file (.esp).  This was done for compatibility issues.\r\n[/list]",
