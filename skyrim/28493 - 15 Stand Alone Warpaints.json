  "descriptionHtml": "[color={orange}][b]Info[/b][/color]\r\nThese fifteen warpaints are for females only, for every race except for Argonians and Khajiits. Orcs have slightly modified texture files to accommodate for their scrunchy noses. Human and elf races have slightly different ear warpaints to make the stripes fiton their ears right with no wrap arounds. \r\n\r\nThese will not replace any existing warpaints, and should be compatible with any extra colors added.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**\r\nWhen changing the color of these warpaints, it will not change immediately. If the color is set to black, and you move it to white, you will have to change the warpaint itself to another one and then change it back to see the color change. The creation kit doesn\\'t save the file properly if I \\\"assign\\\" more than one warpaint colors. It doesn\\'t hinder too much, but I know it is kind of annoying and I am sorry about that! I\\'m working on sifting out that problem and I\\'ll update these as soon as I can figure it out!\r\n\r\n[b]Please[/b] do not upload my warpaints to other websites without my permission. If you would like to upload them with a custom follower, NPC, or what have you, please credit and notify me.\r\n\r\nI love seeing people\\'s characters!
