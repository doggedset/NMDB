  "descriptionHtml": "The Crafter\\'s Crypt is a player home I created to satisfy my desire for the perfect home for a crafting-focused character, along with having decent interior lighting and little or no lag.\r\n\r\nThe home includes:\r\n* Smelter\r\n* Blacksmith\\'s Forge\r\n* Armor Workbench\r\n* Grind Wheel\r\n* Alchemy Table\r\n* Enchanting Table\r\n* Cooking Spit\r\n* Wood Chopping Block\r\n* Player Bed\r\n* Four storage chests\r\n\r\nIt is located just outside of Whiterun. Go to the area where Ri\\'saad and his caravan usually set up camp, and then go north along the rocks until you find a stream. The entrance is a sewer grate that will be to the left of the small waterfall which feeds the stream. A lantern is set out on top of a barrel to help find it at night.\r\n\r\nJust a note, this is my first mod, and I plan to improve it over time. Suggestions are welcome!",
