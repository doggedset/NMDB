  "descriptionHtml": "Description:\r\nA standalone craftable armor set under the ebony smithing section. I call it the Jade Knight Armor set because its green and it sounded cool haha. I don’t know what lore-friendly is like the guidelines that make it lore-friendly so I hope its lore enough for you..? \r\n\r\nPossible Bugs:\r\nIt is only designed for humans I’m still working on the other races and keep in mind this is a WIP im still improving the textures etc. I’m not new at this but I’m not really good either. \r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nI don’t know what that automatic installer is because I don’t use it. But to install just drag everything in the data folder of the mod into the data folder of Skyrim. Which you can find in the Steam Apps. \r\n\r\nJade Knight Credits:\r\n•\tfume0101 – For his amazing Sicarius Armor textures that I used as a template.\r\n•\tMaddMordi-Stock - http://maddmordi-stock.deviantart.com/art/Leather-002-124882531\r\n•\tStratification - http://stratification.deviantart.com/art/Weathered-Leather-87792032\r\n•\tshodan44 – for his orc helmet mod\r\n",
