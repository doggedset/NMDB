I have perfected this process through extensive \r<br />user-assisted experimentation and testing to take into account a massive number of variables.  \r<br />We have come a very long way from [url=forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/904953-how-to-merge-multiple-mods-with-multiple-master-files]the manual merging method[/url] that was known 2 years ago.\r<br />\r<br />The script is extremely easy to use, just select the mods you want to merge in xEdit, run the \r<br />script, type in a name, and presto&#33; Your mods are now in a single clean package&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b]Version 1.8:[/b][/size]\r<br />[color=#66CC99]//=====================================================================================================[/color]\r<br />After extensive beta testing and development, Merge Plugins v1.8 has been publicly released.  \r<br />A lot has changed since v1.7, so it is extremely important for you to read the summary below.  \r<br />You can also check out the change log.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ffd966][b]TES5Edit version checking:[/b][/color][/b]\r<br />The script will terminate and print messages to xEdit&#39;s internal message log if you aren&#39;t using \r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859]xEdit version 3.0.33[/url] or newer.  Because there isn&#39;t a way for me to check the svn of xEdit, you \r<br />will pass this test even if you&#39;re using an old xEdit 3.0.33 svn.  For this reason, I recommend \r<br />that when you download version 1.8 you [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859]download the latest version of xEdit[/url] as well. Currently,\r<br />the latest version is available on Nexus Mods (version 3.1.0).  Having the latest xEdit version \r<br />is absolutely essential for the script to run properly.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ffd966][b] Advanced options:[/b][/color][/b]\r<br />The GUI has received a massive overhaul.  The settings that dictate how a merge is performed \r<br />have been moved to a separate window, which you can open by clicking the gear icon in the \r<br />lower right corner of the main Merge Plugins window.  This[color=#88ddff] &#34;Advanced Options&#34;[/color] window will \r<br />automatically open the first time you run the script.  You cannot perform a merge until you have \r<br />set your settings in this window.  Settings will be saved to [color=#88ff88]&#34;Edit Scripts&#92;mp&#92;config.ini&#34;[/color], and \r<br />reloaded each time you run the script in the future.  Every control in the Advanced Options \r<br />Window has detailed Hint text which will appear if you mouse over it.  Hints that say LEGACY \r<br />OPTION correspond to options you shouldn&#39;t use unless you&#39;re doing experimentation.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ffd966][b] Mod Organizer options:[/b][/color][/b]\r<br />If you&#39;re using Mod Organizer, you need to the check the [color=#88ddff]&#34;I&#39;m using Mod Organizer&#34;[/color] checkbox \r<br />and then make sure the script knows where Mod Organizer is installed.  If you click the Detect \r<br />button the script will attempt to find Mod Organizer by searching standard installation \r<br />directories.  You can also enter the path manually or click on the folder icon to browse for it.  \r<br />The path here should be a full path to the directory holding ModOrganizer.exe.  E.g. [color=#88ff88]\r<br />&#34;C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Mod Organizer&#92;&#34;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />There is a new option here called Copy general assets.  This option only works with Mod \r<br />Organizer, and has the script copy assets from the [color=#88ff88]&#34;Mod Organizer&#92;mods&#92;*&#92;&#34;[/color] folders \r<br />corresponding to the ESPs you&#39;re merging.  I highly recommend you use this option if you&#39;re \r<br />using Mod Organizer.\r<br />\r<br />[b]\r<br />[/b][b][color=#ffd966][b]Renumbering options:[/b][/color][/b]\r<br />A new option called [color=#88ddff]&#34;Renumber conflicting FormIDs&#34;[/color] has been added.  This is the best of two \r<br />worlds in that it only renumbers the records that need to be renumbered to avoid fatal conflicts \r<br />(duplicate FormIDs), but doesn&#39;t renumber everything so esoteric issues relating to renumbering \r<br />FormIDs are mitigated.  You should always use this option, resorting to [color=#88ddff]&#34;Renumber all FormIDs&#34;[/color] \r<br />only if merging with [color=#88ddff]&#34;Renumber conflicting FormIDs&#34;[/color] isn&#39;t creating a functioning merged plugin.\r<br />\r<br />You should never use [color=#88ddff]&#34;Don&#39;t renumber FormIDs&#34;[/color] unless you know what you&#39;re doing and are \r<br />prepared to face the issues associated with duplicate FormIDs.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ffd966][b]Copying options:[/b][/color][/b]\r<br />You should always use [color=#88ddff]&#34;Copy Intelligently&#34;[/color] unless you&#39;re doing experimentation.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ffd966][b]Second pass copying options:[/b][/color][/b]      \r<br />Second pass copying used to be necessary to create functioning merged plugins with certain \r<br />records (NAVM, NAVI).  Recent xEdit updates may have made it unnecessary. To be safe, \r<br />you can use the [color=#88ddff]&#34;Second pass same as first&#34;[/color] option, though this will extend the time spent \r<br />merging.  The default option is [color=#88ddff]&#34;No second pass&#34;[/color], which I have determined works for mods \r<br />that used to require a second pass.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ffd966][b] Other options:[/b][/color][/b]\r<br />The [color=#88ddff]&#34;Asset destination directory&#34;[/color] is the directory where the script will copy assets to.  If you&#39;re \r<br />using Mod Organizer this should be Mod Organizer&#39;s overwrite folder.  This will automatically be \r<br />set if the script successfully detects Mod Organizer after you click the Detect button.  You can \r<br />also enter the path manually or click on the folder icon to browse for a destination folder.  If \r<br />you&#39;re using NMM your destination folder could be either Skyrim&#39;s data folder or a different \r<br />folder which you plan on making into a mod package to install into Nexus Mod Manager later.\r<br />\r<br />The [color=#88ddff]&#34;Extract BSAs&#34;[/color] option will extract all BSAs associated with the plugins being merged to the [color=#88ddff]\r<br />&#34;Asset destination directory&#34;[/color].  This is only necessary if you&#39;re using NMM, as Mod Organizer will \r<br />load all assets from available BSAs automatically regardless of whether or not there&#39;s an ESP \r<br />with a matching file name.  Also note that, when copying file-specific assets like FaceGenData, \r<br />Voices, and MCM Translation files the script will check inside available BSAs as well as your \r<br />data directory, so you no longer need to extract BSAs before merging for that purpose anymore.\r<br />\r<br />The [color=#88ddff]&#34;Disable label coloring&#34;[/color] option is for users that can&#39;t see the colored labels in the main \r<br />[color=#88ddff]&#34;Merge Plugins&#34;[/color] window.  An alternative to using this option is to enable Windows Aero.\r<br />\r<br />The [color=#88ddff]&#34;Batch copy assets&#34;[/color] option will copy all assets after merging via a batch (.bat) script.  This \r<br />option is valuable when performing large merges, as Delphi&#39;s internal CopyFile function operates \r<br />asynchronously, which leads to massive memory and CPU usage, and will often lead to xEdit \r<br />running out of available memory.  You should always have this option enabled, but take note of \r<br />the fact that it will open a visible Command Prompt (cmd.exe) window at the end of the merge \r<br />for asset copying.  You must not close TES5Edit or this window during the copying operation if you \r<br />want asset copying to be performed correctly.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ffd966][b]Asset destination helper:[/b][/color][/b]\r<br />With the introduction of the [color=#88ddff]&#34;Asset destination directory&#34;[/color] feature, I also implemented a check\r<br />which makes certain the asset destination directory is empty before performing any operations\r<br />for the merge.  If it&#39;s not empty, a window will appear alerting you that it&#39;s not empty, giving\r<br />you the options to proceed with the merge, open the directory in explorer, or cancel the merge.\r<br />This should help you avoid the mistake of including files in the merged mod that aren&#39;t needed.\r<br />If you&#39;re using the data directory as the asset destination directory when you first run the script, \r<br />you will be notified that using it will make your data directory messy over time, and isn&#39;t \r<br />recommended.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b]Installation:[/b][/size]\r<br />[color=#66CC99]//=====================================================================================================[/color]\r<br />Before installing and using this script [color=#ff5555][i][b]you need xEdit 3.0.33 svn1898 or newer[/b][/i][/color].\r<br />xEdit is an alternative editing program to the Creation Kit.  While xEdit may not have some \r<br />of the cool features the Creation Kit has, it runs faster and allows for the execution of pascal \r<br />scripts.\r<br />\r<br />You can get xEdit 3.1.0 [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859]here[/url].\r<br />\r<br />Once you have downloaded and installed xEdit you simply need to copy the contents of the \r<br />included &#34;Edit Scripts&#34; folder into xEdit&#39;s &#34;Edit Scripts&#34; folder.  This folder is located in the \r<br />directory where TES5Edit.exe is.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b]Tutorial:[/b][/size]\r<br />[color=#66CC99]//=====================================================================================================[/color]\r<br />[color=#ffd966][b]Merging Plugins with Mod Organizer:[/b][/color][b]\r<br />[font=Tahoma]1.

This will only work on plugins made with\r<br />Merge Plugins v1.7 or newer.  Note: this is an experimental feature and results may vary.\r<br />\r<br />[b]1. [/b]Load your merged plugin in TES5Edit.\r<br />[color=#bad0f4][b]2. [/b]Right click on the merged plugin, and click &#34;Apply Script&#34;.[/color]\r<br />[b]3.

[/b]Close the Merged Plugin Manager and then exit TES5Edit, saving the merged plugin.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffd966][b]Generating and Submitting Reports:[/b][/color]\r<br />As of v1.7, you can generate reports on the merge-ability of plugins. This can be done with a Merged\r<br />Plugin or with the ESP files you merged.\r<br />\r<br />[b]1. [/b]Load your merged plugin in TES5Edit.\r<br />[color=#bad0f4][b]2. [/b]Right click on the merged plugin, and click &#34;Apply Script&#34;.[/color]\r<br />[b]3. [/b]Choose &#34;Merged Plugin Manager v1.1&#34; from the drop-down menu and click OK.\r<br />[color=#bad0f4][b]4. [/b]Check the plugins you want to generate reports on, then click &#34;Report&#34;.[/color]\r<br />[b]5. [/b]Enter the information you want to submit for each report.  You won&#39;t be able to generate the\r<br />report if you leave one or more fields blank or at their default values.\r<br />[color=#bad0f4][b]6. [/b]Once you&#39;ve generated your reports, go to your Edit Scripts folder and open the &#34;mp&#34; folder.[/color]\r<br />[b]7.[/b] Run &#34;Merge Plugins Report Client.jar&#34;, enter a username you want to have associated with \r<br />your report, and click &#34;Login&#34;.\r<br />[color=#bad0f4][b]8. [/b]Click &#34;Send Reports&#34; to send all reports you have generated to the remote server to be \r<br />incorporated with the Dictionary file.[/color]\r<br />[b]9. [/b]Click &#34;Logout&#34;.\r<br />[b]\r<br />NOTE: [/b]If you&#39;re found to be abusing the report submission system your IP will be blacklisted and \r<br />you will no longer be able to submit reports or get updated dictionary files through the client.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffd966][b]Updating your Dictionary File:[/b][/color]\r<br />Updating your dictionary file will give you all the latest definitions from reports submitted by\r<br />users.  I recommend you try to update your dictionary file before merging, and at most once \r<br />a week.\r<br />\r<br />[b]1. [/b]Go to your Edit Scripts folder and open the &#34;mp&#34; folder.\r<br />[color=#bad0f4][b]2. [/b]Run &#34;Merge Plugins Report Client.jar&#34;, enter a username, and click &#34;Login&#34;.[/color]\r<br />[b]3. [/b]Click &#34;Get Dictionary&#34;.\r<br />[color=#bad0f4][b]4.

This was done because there is a demonstratable performance hit when printing many \r<br />messages to the xEdit log.  To maximize the speed gained by not using a visible log, you \r<br />should not click the [color=#88ddff]&#34;Show Details&#34;[/color] button while the merge is being performed.\r<br />\r<br />The script&#39;s internal log will be saved to a file [color=#88ff88]&#34;Edit Scripts&#92;mp&#92;logs&#92;merge_&lt;date&gt;_&lt;time&gt;.txt&#34;[/color]\r<br />after the script finishes executing.  If you experience problems you [color=#ff5555][i][b]must[/b][/i][/color] copy the messages\r<br />from the log file associated with the merge and post them here or on [url=http://pastebin.com]pastebin[/url] if you wish\r<br />to recieve assistance.  Without a log file I can only really take shots in the dark as to what \r<br />went wrong with your merge.  With a log file, I can determine within 30 seconds what went \r<br />wrong with a merge and respond immediately.

Is this still the case?[/color][b]\r<br />[/b][color=#ffffff][b]A: [/b]Based on 2791 reports submitted as of 02/12/2015, 97.56% of plugins merge well.  \r<br />Considering how v1.8 has a large number of bugfixes and improvements over v1.7, this\r<br />percentage will only be getting higher.\r<br />[/color][b]\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] [/color][/b][color=#FF9966]Will &lt;insert mod here&gt; work?[/color][b]\r<br />[/b][color=#ffffff][b]A: [/b]Based on user-submitted reports, there&#39;s a 97.56% likelihood it will work.  Those are \r<br />some pretty good odds.[/color][b]\r<br />[/b][/color][color=#FF9966][b]\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] [/color][/b][color=#FF9966]How do merge plugins behave with BOSS/LOOT?[/color][b]\r<br />[/b][color=#ffffff][b]A: [/b]BOSS and LOOT don&#39;t know how to place merged plugins in your load order.  You have to \r<br />manually place them at the highest load order position of the mods you merged with respect \r<br />to masters.  (Viz., not above a file that is a master for the merged plugin.)[/color][b]\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/color][color=#FF9966][b][color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] [/color][/b][color=#FF9966]Can I merge merged files?[/color][b]\r<br />[/b][color=#ffffff][b]A: [/b]Yes, just not during the same run of xEdit (save and quit before each new merge).  This shouldn&#39;t \r<br />introduce new problems, just remember to backup so if you merge something bad you can undo it \r<br />and keep the merged file you&#39;ve been working on.[/color][b]\r<br />\r<br />Q: [/b]What can I do about errors in plugins I want to merge?\r<br />[color=#ffffff][b]A: [/b]Well that depends on what the error is.  If its a [color=#ffe599]&#34;&lt;Record&gt; marked as deleted...&#34;[/color] error\r<br />you can clean the plugin using xEdit&#39;s [color=#88ddff]&#34;Apply Filter for Cleaning&#34;[/color] and [color=#FF9966][color=#ffffff][color=#88ddff]&#34;Undelete and Disable\r<br />References&#34;[/color][/color][/color] options.  Other errors can be more complicated.  Invalid or out of order subrecord\r<br />errors often can&#39;t be fixed, but you can try[color=#FF9966] [color=#ffffff]o[/color][/color]pening these mods in the Creation Kit as the active file \r<br />and then resaving them.  [color=#ffe599]&#34;&lt; Error: Could not be resolved &gt;&#34; [/color]FormIDs can be fixed by entering a \r<br />valid FormID in their place or by removing the subrecord that holds them (right click -&gt; Remove).\r<br />[b][color=#e06666][b][color=#ff5555]NOTE:[/color][/b][/color] [/b]Fixing errors asides from UDRs can be a tricky business.  Make sure you keep backups\r<br />of the plugins you plan on fixing errors for in case you accidentally break one of them&#33;[/color]\r<br />[b]\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] [/color][/b][color=#FF9966]Can mods with MCM menus be merged?[/color][b]\r<br />[color=#ffffff][b]A:[/b][/color][/b][color=#ffffff] As of v1.7 MCM translation files are handled properly, so MCMs should merge perfectly.  [/color][b]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] [/color][/b][color=#FF9966]Can I merge ESP patches with their master file?[/color][b]\r<br />[/b][color=#ffffff][b]A: [/b]Yes.[/color][b]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] [/color][/b][color=#FF9966]Can I merge a mod&#39;s patches together?[/color][b]\r<br />[/b][color=#ffffff][b]A:[/b] Yes.[/color]\r<br />[b]\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] [/color][/b][color=#FF9966]What are the benefits of merging?[/color][b]\r<br />[/b][color=#ffffff][b]A:[/b] Merging reduces ESP clutter allowing for more mods.  It also makes your data directory \r<br />more manageable, so you no longer have to rip your hair out trying to find that ONE ESP \r<br />which is causing you problems. It also improves performance, load times, and reduces \r<br />CTDs. It&#39;s basically the panacea for DMS: Disorganized Modder Syndrome.[/color][b]\r<br />\r<br />Q: [/b]SkyRe?  AutomaticVariants?  SUM?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Don&#39;t merge plugins that were made or are in any way related to these mods.  SkyRe was \r<br />made  with TESVSnip, and is a giant mess of corrupted data.  In addition, all third party \r<br />patchers will create corrupted data, which will lead to CTDs if copied in TES5Edit.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] Can I use SUM/AutomaticVariants/the Reproccer on a merged plugin?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Yes.  A merged plugin is a plugin just like any other plugin is a plugin.  A merged plugin is \r<br />just a single plugin with data that used to be spread out between multiple plugins.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#FF9966]Q: [/color][/b][color=#FF9966]Right clicking isn&#39;t doing anything&#33;[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Wait for the background loader to finish loading the mods.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#FF9966]Q: [/color][/b][color=#FF9966]I&#39;m getting CTDs, why?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] If you didn&#39;t check for errors in xEdit you may have merged mods with errors which, can\r<br />lead to CTDs.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] Will this make my game explode?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Just make sure you only save the merged ESP and disable the ESPs you merged from your \r<br />load order when testing the merged file.  If things don&#39;t work for some reason, active your old \r<br />ESPs and delete the merged file and voila, everything&#39;s back to the way it was&#33;  No harm done.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] Where should I put the merged file in my load order?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] At the spot where the highest mod you merged was/should be.  So if you merge mods at \r<br />positions #10, #26, and #100 you want to put the merged ESP at position #10, with respect\r<br />to masters.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] Copy Intelligently?  Copy Records?  Copy Groups?  What are these things&#33;?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Just use copy intelligently.  The other two are old merging methods that advanced users \r<br />can choose to use if they so wish.  You don&#39;t need to worry about them.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] What is corrupted data and can I fix it?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Mods with invalid/out of order subrecords may have corrupted data.  Or, at least, data \r<br />that xEdit can&#39;t interpret properly.  Opening these mods in the Creation Kit as the active file \r<br />and then saving them MAY fix this problem, or it may not.  If you merge mods with these errors \r<br />the result is Skyrim CTDing when it starts.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] My hair&#39;s gone?&#33;  My armor&#39;s gone?&#33;  My weapons are gone?&#33;  My face is gone?&#33;?&#33;  WHAT?&#33;?&#33;[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] When you merge plugins many records are being moved to new FormIDs to prevent conflicts.  \r<br />That means all save games with references to the items from the mods you merged may have the \r<br />items/objects removed.  This is just the way the game works, there&#39;s nothing I can do about it.  \r<br />So say you merge your hair mods and you load a save game where you had a hair from one of those \r<br />mods.  You will be bald.  It&#39;s no biggie though, just use showracemenu, find the hair, and save once \r<br />you&#39;ve fixed your depilation dilemma.  Armors: add them back.  Weapons/items: add them back.  \r<br />Face: uhh... o_o&#39;?  Generally speaking, however, it&#39;s probably best to start on a new save after \r<br />merging hair/object/Leveled List/NPC outfit altering mods.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] Should I check for errors before merging?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Yes.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] Should I check for errors after merging?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Yes.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] Can I merge my entire load order into a single ESP?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Theoretically, if all those mods didn&#39;t have problems with merging, yeah you could.  It&#39;s probably \r<br />best to just merge by mod groups though.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] Should I submit user reports?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Please do.  It takes you all of a few minutes and may be very helpful to other users.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] I&#39;m unable to select the Merge Plugins script from the Apply Script window/which script do I select?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] When you right-click and choose apply script the window that comes up should have a \r<br />drop-down menu from which you must select Merge Plugins v1.8.  DO NOT USE &#34;Merge plugins&#34;, \r<br />this is a WIP non-functional script created by Zilav.  If you do not see Merge Plugins v1.8 in the \r<br />window you&#39;re doing one of a few things wrong:\r<br />[list][*][size=2]You&#39;re starting xEdit from a shortcut, which is starting it in a directory where it doesn&#39;t [/size]\r<br />[size=2]have access to &#34;Edit Scripts/Merge Plugins v1.8.pas&#34;.  Try starting xEdit directly from \r<br />the executable located in the directory as the Edit scripts folder you installed my Merge \r<br />Plugins script into.[/size][/*][*][size=2]You didn&#39;t install my Merge Plugins script correctly.  See the installation section.[/size][/*]\r<br />[/list][center] [/center]\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] Can I remove an ESP from a merged plugin?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Yes&#33;  As of v1.7 you can do this with the Merged Plugin Manager&#33;  Note: this is an experimental \r<br />feature, your results may vary.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] mteFunctions.pas is included in both AutomationTools and the Merge Plugins script, which should I use?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Use the one in the Merge Plugins script.  If you really want to be certain you&#39;re using \r<br />the most up to date version (all versions are backwards compatible) you can grab that from \r<br />[url=https://github.com/matortheeternal/TES5EditScripts/blob/master/trunk/Edit%20Scripts/mteFunctions.pas]my GitHub[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] TES5Edit has to be in its own folder?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] That&#39;s how I like to organize things. This is no longer required as of version 1.7.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] When do merged plugins cause problems?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Merged plugins fail/cause problems when data isn&#39;t properly copied to them by xEdit or \r<br />when assets aren&#39;t properly made available to them.  Merged plugins are plugins just like all \r<br />other plugins are plugins.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] Can I merge ESM files?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] If the ESM files are used by any other files in your load order you should not merge them. \r<br />If they aren&#39;t used by any other files in your load order, you can merge them.  Alternatively you \r<br />can open the master file and all the files that use it as a master and merge them all together.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] Can older merged plugins I made continue to work with new versions of TES5Edit/the script?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Yes.  You don&#39;t need to re-merge things whenever there is an update to TES5Edit/the \r<br />Merge Plugins script.  If the merge is working, it&#39;s working.  However, you won&#39;t be able\r<br />to use the features of the Merged Plugin manager on Merged Plugins that were made in \r<br />versions prior to 1.7.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] I&#39;m getting grey faces still... why?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] Shouldn&#39;t happen in v1.8 unless you didn&#39;t set your Asset destination directory\r<br />correctly.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] I got &#34;Error in unit &#39;mteFuntions&#39;...&#34;, why?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] You installed an older version of mteFunctions.pas.  Reinstall the latest version of the \r<br />merge plugins script and make sure you replace your current mteFunctions.pas with the one \r<br />in v1.8.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] Is it OK to rename merged plugins after merging?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] No.  Renaming the merged plugin will break the association of various assets with it.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF9966][b]Q:[/b] How much can this reduce my load order?[/color]\r<br />[b]A:[/b] I&#39;ve heard reports of ~70% plugin reduction in load orders (insaneplumber, 357 to 104 \r<br />plugins).  It all depends on the mods you&#39;re using.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://www.skyrimgems.com/images/gems_logo.png[/img]\r<br />[url=http://www.skyrimgems.com/utilities.html]Skyrim G.E.M.S. -- Utilities[/url][/center]",

This can be used to generate reports\r<br />      or to remove plugins from an existing merged plugin.\r<br />    - Created a client-server interface for submitted reports and getting updated \r<br />      dictionary files. <br/> \n",

      "changelogHtml": " \r<br />  - Internal logging now used instead of TES5Edit logging.  Some TES5Edit\r<br />    log messages will still be used.  Logs are automatically saved to a\r<br />    text document in Edit Scripts/mp/logs/merge_&lt;date&gt;_&lt;time&gt;.txt.  The\r<br />    log can be viewed during execution by clicking on the Show Details\r<br />    button.\r<br />  - Logs folder is automatically created if it didn&#39;t exist before the\r<br />    script was executed.\r<br />  - New separate &#34;Advanced Options&#34; window for setting script options.\r<br />  - Settings specified in the advanced options window will be saved to a\r<br />    the file Edit Scripts&#92;mp&#92;config.ini whenever you click OK.  These \r<br />    settings are then loaded and used each time the script is run in the\r<br />    future.\r<br />  - Automatic detection of Mod Organizer&#39;s directory has been added.\r<br />  - Log saves even if script terminates prematurely.\r<br />  - Better messages when a record fails to copy.\r<br />  - Note: Several of the options in the Advanced Options window are\r<br />    disabled because they haven&#39;t been implemented yet.\r<br />  - New option: Renumber Conflicting FormIDs only renumbers FormIDs that \r<br />    conflict with each other.  \r<br />  - Fixed asset copying to work with MO&#39;s virtual data directory as well \r<br />    as a real Skyrim data directory (e.g. NMM or manual installation).\r<br />  - Fixed renumbering methods to not terminate prematurely.\r<br />  - Made it so the script will wait for the user to close the progress \r<br />    window after execution instead of closing it automatically.\r<br />  - Enhanced the advanced options GUI with hints and messages to help \r<br />    the user use the script properly.\r<br />  - Added separate Asset destination directory so the user can set where \r<br />    the script copies assets to.\r<br />  - Added CopyAll option, which copies assets from Mod Organizer mod \r<br />    folders to the asset destination folder.\r<br />  - Fixed reference redirection error in Renumber Conflicting FormIDs \r<br />    method.\r<br />  - Added BSA extraction.\r<br />  - Added asset destination directory helper which will help the user if \r<br />    the directory they have set isn&#39;t empty. \r<br />  - Improved logging and clearer difference between normal mode and \r<br />    debug mode.\r<br />  - File Specific asset copying fixed to also copy from BSAs.\r<br />  - Fixed asset copying not handling renumbered FormIDs correctly.\r<br />  - Fixed issues with merged plugin description not being created properly.\r<br />  - Fixed issue with Next Object ID not being updated properly, causing\r<br />    formlists to conflict with other records.\r<br />  - Fixed issue with Remove() being used in second pass copying instead of\r<br />    RemoveNode().\r<br />  - Added batch copying, which allows you to do asset copying via a batch\r<br />    file constructed by the script after the script&#39;s execution.  This is\r<br />    necessary for large merges where the memory footprint of CopyFile can\r<br />    become an issue.\r<br />  - Fixed TMemIni to use WriteBool and ReadBool for boolean values.\r<br />  - Made internal log more responsive with Application.processmessages; \r<br />    after each new LogMessage.\r<br />  - Adjusted remove masters routine to be more efficient.\r<br />  - Better memory management (everything is freed properly, now).\r<br />  - Copy General Assets now works correctly when modPath isn&#39;t found.\r<br />  - Description no longer has issues with Merged Plugin: text.\r<br />  - Script now forces TempPath to exist, in case it&#39;s been deleted.\r<br />  - Filename sanitization now put in mteFunctions.\r<br />  - Automatically updates GUI after merging via RemoveFilter(), which was\r<br />    added in xEdit svn1876.\r<br />  - Changed two-pass copying to remove immediately after copying, which should\r<br />    correct any issues with merging into existing files with two-pass copying.\r<br />  - Fixed issue with script closing the progress bar/log window when an exception\r<br />    occurs instead of leaving it open.\r<br />  - Fixed issue with Renumbering FormIDs where incorrect FormIDs were being \r<br />    added to the OldForms and NewForms stringlists (which affected FormLists).\r<br />  - More robust approach to TempPath, will now try to use a secondary path if\r<br />    DirectoryExists(TempPath) returns false after using ForceDirectories(TempPath),\r<br />    and will terminate the script if the secondary path fails as well.\r<br />  - Added PluginForm, which can be viewed by clicking a plugin label in the main \r<br />    MergeForm.  This form shows more details on reports on a particular plugin.\r<br />  - Massive fix, the Duplicate FormID errors that came up when copying CELL/WRLD\r<br />    records have been fixed.  The fix is kind of ugly right now, but it should\r<br />    result in working merged plugins.  A cleaner fix would require a direct change\r<br />    to how wbCopyElementToFile works in the xEdit binary.\r<br />  - If there are no files to be copied, the batch copy messages will not be printed\r<br />    to the log and the script won&#39;t stop at the end to wait for batch copying to \r<br />    complete (because there is no batch copying happening).]\r<br />  - Fixed issue with Renumber Conflicting FormIDs failing to properly index FormIDs\r<br />    from a file being merged into.\r<br />  - Fixed voice asset copying directory error.\r<br />  - Revised hints in merge window.\r<br />  - Removed unimplemented &#34;Disable Plugins&#34; checkbox.\r<br />  - Made it so MCM translation file copying is logged at a basic level even when \r<br />    debugMCM isn&#39;t true. <br/> \n",

ESP and ESM files\r<br />will always be in the base folder for the mod, else xEdit wouldn&#39;t have been\r<br />able to load them in the first place.\r<br />- Now using Edit Scripts&#92;mp&#92;temp as temporary directory, and verifying files\r<br />can be saved in the temporary directory.\r<br />- Implemented user-friendly EditOutOfDate method from mteFunctions when it has\r<br />been detected that the user is using an out of date version of xEdit.\r<br />- Now using robocopy instead of the deprecated xcopy function when copying\r<br />general assets with batch copying.\r<br />- Now logging batch copying to the merge log.\r<br />- Merge logs named properly (no more AM/PM).\r<br />- Now using copy instead of robocopy when useRobocopy constant is false. This\r<br />fix should help users who have privilege escalation issues when starting xEdit\r<br />through Mod Organizer.\r<br />- Updated EditOutOfDate method to take a URL as a parameter, now pointing to Nexus\r<br />Mods for TES5Edit (because of the 3.1.0 release).\r<br />- Fixed issue with Merged Plugin Manager not doing smart removal correctly due to\r<br />GetEditValues returning the wrong variable type when used in a function call. <br/> \n",
