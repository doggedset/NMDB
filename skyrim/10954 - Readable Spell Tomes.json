  "descriptionHtml": "This is a modder\\'s resource. I won\\'t restrict players from downloading it of course, but recognize that there is no new text added to the spell tomes. They have merely been made readable.\r\n\r\nIf you would like me to create a version that makes Spell Tomes from a certain mod readable (Midas Magic, for instance), then let me know and I\\'ll work on it.\r\n\r\nThe only confliction that I can think of would be a mod in which a script depends upon Spell Tomes being destroyed. If you are creating a mod, and would like me to make this script compatible with whatever process you are using, I\\'d be happy to do so to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\nThe name of the new script is: SpellTomeReadScript\r\n\r\nTo take a look at the tutorial for creating readable spell tomes, visit this link: http://tesmods.blogspot.com/2012/02/tutorial-readable-spell-tomes.html",
