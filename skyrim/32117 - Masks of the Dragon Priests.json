  "descriptionHtml": "If you\\'ve played Skyrim for a while, you\\'ve probably encountered at least one of the Dragon Priest Masks, but there is no resource in-world to help you locate all 8 of these treasures.  \r\n\r\nThis mods adds a book entitled \\\"Masks of the Dragon Priests\\\" to the world of Skyrim, providing lore-friendly descriptions of the evil Dragon Priests and the locations of their masks.  No frills, just useful information for the adventurer seeking some of the game\\'s finest enchanted objects.  If you don\\'t find a copy in a chest or bookshelf, you can buy a copy from the magic-merchants in Markarth, Morthal, and the College at Winterhold.  \r\n\r\nTO INSTALL: Add the file \\\"dragonpriestsbook.esp\\\" to your Data folder (...\\\\skyrim\\\\data)\r\nTO UNINSTALL: Just remove the file \\\"dragonpriestsbook.esp\\\" from your Data folder.  No gameplay changes should occur.",
