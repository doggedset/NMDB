  "descriptionHtml": "I was browsing the other Main Menu Background Replacers on the Nexus when i saw a comment in the posts about how someone liked a personal background someone had made. the person with the background didnt want to share theirs, and i respect that.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, what i can do is take a person&#39;s preference and make them a background, custom tailored.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am new to Nexus modding, and saw this as a pre-learners intro into it. They aren&#39;t perfect, but they DO work, and aren&#39;t bad.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Files Section you will find 2 versions of each background. \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) With Bethesda Logo and \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) Without Bethesda Logo\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation Instructions:\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The install directions are the same for both versions\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Unpack the file you downloaded to a location of your choice. Though dragging the files directly from the .rar file to the destination location is possible, this can result in less than necessary file integrity. \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) For safety reasons, i recommend you make a back up at this point of: Skyrim/Data/Meshes/Interface\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skyrim/Data/Textures/Interface \r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;folders if they are present in your installation directory.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) With the above backed up, Copy/Move the downloaded and extracted Data folder of this mod to your Skyrim Installation directory, NOT into the Data Folder. Overwrite when prompted.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) Close all open windows and launch Skyrim via your favorite/current launcher. If you followed the above instructions, then your background should have been changed from the default Dragon and solid black to the background you downloaded.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Un-Installation:\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Logo Version-\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delete the following files:\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Data/Meshes/Interface/logo/logo.nif\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Data/Textures/Interface/Objects/MAINMENUWALLPAPER.dds\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-No Logo Version-\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delete the following:\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Data/Interface/startmenu.swf\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Data/Meshes/Interface/logo/logo.nif\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Data/Textures/Interface/Objects/MAINMENUWALLPAPER.dds\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter which options instructions you follow, to be safe re-merge your back up files with those in your data directory to insure any files you had before are restored.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;",
