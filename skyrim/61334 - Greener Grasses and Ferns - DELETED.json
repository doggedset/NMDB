  "summary": "Making Grass and ferns look less dead.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Firstly I [b]highly [/b]recommend using the Grass on Steroids mod. It both makes landscapes look better and i optimized my mod to look best when using it, specifically i use the goldilocks version. It can be found here ---&gt; http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33582/? &lt;---\r<br />\r<br />Many of the grass and fern textures in the game look fine but a few of the most commonly used ones are brown and lifeless. The aim of this mod is to make them look better by re-texturing them to be greener and higher(ish)-res. All texture and normal map resolutions are 1024x1024, twice the vanilla resolution but still small enough to cost as little performance as possible. \r<br />\r<br />As a texture replacer it will overwrite any other texture mods that modify the same grass and fern textures. For best results i recommend placing mod as low in your mods list as possible. \r<br />\r<br />(Optional Files)\r<br />\r<br />Added alternate bark texture replacer for Aspen trees. The bark is now textured to look like Birch trees, there isn&#39;t much difference between the two other then the alternate texture looks cleaner. \r<br />\r<br />Added alternate green leaves for Aspen trees and LOD textures to match. Just as the bark option this is stand-alone.\r<br />\r<br />(Future Plans)\r<br />\r<br />[s]Currently working on making Aspen leaves green. The distance LOD texture for trees is refusing to cooperate but i will make the replacer available as soon as i can make it presentable.[/s] (EDIT, Done&#33;)",
