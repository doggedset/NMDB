  "descriptionHtml": "Adds arcane devices and tomes which analyze alchemy ingredients -- even those from other mods -- in a game-balanced and lore-friendly manner. \r\n \r\nLet\\'s face it: someone has probably already figured out that the dragon gizzard you scavenged from your last kill cures warts on sabertooth kittens. So why are you running around gathering stuff only to waste it in blind, mindless experimentation?\r\n \r\nThe Automated Alchemical Analyzer is a conduit to the Royal Alchemists Guild in Cyrodiil. Place any unknown items in the container, push a button, and for a small fee a registered alchemist will tell you what you have and what it does - without even losing the sample. If you are lacking funds, you can even perform the analysis yourself. You can find one behind the locked door in Arcadia\\'s shop in Whiterun, hidden under the stairs. And people wonder why she\\'s so skilled at Alchemy when she can\\'t even tell a case of the Rattles from Porphyric Hemophilia...\r\n\r\nAlso keep your eyes open for \\\"Alchemy Tomes\\\" in several locations across Skyrim. These work just like Spellbooks and Ability books, except that when you read them, you learn about the alchemical properties of various items. These generally come in two styles - learn a lot about a few items (such as bird eggs) or learn a little about a lot of items (such as animal parts). Look for three on Arcadia\\'s dining room table.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2 Update:\r\n\r\nLowered analysis price from 10x to 3x value of item.\r\n\r\nAdded 5 new Analyzers: Sindarion\\'s Field Lab in Blackreach, Drelas\\' Cottage, The Midden, Dawnstar Sanctuary,  the Cistern Vault and the Archmage\\'s Quarters. Unlike Arcadia\\'s, these are all unlocked.\r\n\r\nSearch these areas for the following Alchemy Tomes as well, and expand your knowledge of rare ingredient properties:\r\n\r\n- Eggs of the Northern Wastelands\r\n- Bug Mashing for Fun and Profit\r\n- The Big Book of Daedra\r\n- The Master Baiter (and other Fish Tales)\r\n- Botany for Barbarians\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1 Update:\r\n\r\nAdded Alchemy Tomes - Mod authors are encouraged to add their own Tomes... Just add my SnauxAlchemyTeachPropertiesScript to any book, and point it to a Formlist of your own ingredients... just give me credit, a link to this mod, and don\\'t modify the script!\r\n  \r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n \r\nMy other Mods:\r\n \r\nFishing In Skyrim http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=39990763\r\n God-Gear and Glory Bookset http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=673281\r\n Longer Duration Crafting Potions http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=715527\r\n Marriable Aranea Ienith http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=20712",
