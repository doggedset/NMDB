  "descriptionHtml": "Less Condescending Steward\r\n\r\nThis mini-mod addresses the problem when your steward will simply get on your nerves and\r\nmake you constantly ask why they volunteered for a job they hate so much.\r\n\r\nWhat it does is it disables greetings and goodbyes for a non-player character \r\nwho has become your steward as follows:\r\n\r\n\\\"Make it quick!\\\"\r\n\\\"Speak!\\\"\r\n\\\"Now, if you\\'ll excuse me...\\\"\r\n\r\nThe following lines I decided to keep, as they are not so bad and I feel they go along with the actual character:\r\n\r\n\\\"Need something?\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was especially made for Ingjard, obviously, who is quite nice and respectful when she is your follower,\r\nbut when she becomes a steward she goes back to her annoyingly condescending self.  \r\nImagine somehow getting Grelka as your steward only you had not known what you were getting in advance.\r\n\r\nIt will affect other stewards including males if they had such dialogue lines,\r\nbut mostly those who have the condescending voice type and only NPCs who are currently your steward.\r\n\r\nIf you feel more or less lines should be disabled feel free to make a suggestion.\r\n\r\n(Un)Installation is very easy as this mod is a single ESP file. \r\nYou may use NMM or similar if you are into that kind of thing.\r\n\r\nIt goes almost without saying that the Hearthfire DLC is a requirement.\r\n\r\nA minor issue is that it makes Ingjard less talkative as she will mostly say \\\"Hmm.\\\" or \\\"Yes?\\\"\r\nbut I very much prefer that.\r\n\r\nAs for conflicts, I don\\'t know of any.  This mini-mod touches only a little.\r\nThere is a mod called \\\"Remove Annoying Lines - Incl Housecarls and Townsfolk\\\"\r\nwhich changes different dialogue lines as far as I know.\r\nI\\'d load mine after that one if you like to use both.\r\n",
