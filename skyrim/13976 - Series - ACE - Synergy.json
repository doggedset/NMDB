Remember these effects have no perk costs.\r\nSome good examples are:\r\nA standard perk combination giving a small but reasonable bonus.\r\nAn unlikely perk combination giving a mediocre bonus.\r\nA very unlikely combination of several perks giving an awesome cool bonus.\r\n\r\nAnother goal is to push players to expand skills and perks, even items and game behavior, outside of the standard generic behavior.\r\nAlso, all current bonuses are open to changes, I would love to make existing bonuses more interesting more than adding new bonuses.\r\n\r\n[color=008000][size=4][b]Mod Compatibility[/b][/size][/color]\r\n- Completely compatible with all mods.\r\n\r\n[/center]",
