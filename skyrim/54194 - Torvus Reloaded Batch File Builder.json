Supporting targeted scripts and a whole bunch else, you&#39;ll spit out a batch file capable of putting any mod to the test. As of 4/21/16, Torvus has been renamed Torvus Reloaded, as it is far better and far better designed than its predecessor. Along with the newly designed interface, TR contains support for better targeted scripts as well as more commands. IncPcs command is selectable in the menu and just general fixes. Also included is a logging subroutine that records just about everything the program does in case of a bug. There is an option to view the log in the Help menu.\r<br />\r<br />[/size]PLEASE DL AND ENDORSE&#33; :) Thanx&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]ABOUT TORVUS CONSOLE INCPCS UTILITY\r<br />[/b][/size]So, I&#39;,m debating on tinkering with a console (command line) version of Torvus. I dunno. But, I did do this one. Although useless, it did make me think that it might be a neat idea. click spoiler to find out how much of a waste of time it was. lol\r<br />[spoiler]\r<br />UPDATE: I didn&#39;t realize this but Skyrim caps IncPcs skill commands out at 100. Which makes the rest of the commands after the 100th time, useless and irrelevant. \r<br />\r<br />So, I used the batch file generated with 1.8 million lines. Nothing happened aside from freezing for 3 minutes. \r<br />\r<br />Anticlimactic. Meh, whatever. It only took about an hour to code.\r<br />\r<br />I was expecting at least some graphical anomalies or something. Nothing. Skyrim is quite the sturdy program I guess... I think I&#39;m gonna try the one with 18 million lines and get a cup of coffee...\r<br />\r<br />Stress testing Skyrim... Yeah, I&#39;m bored today.\r<br />\r<br />So the console application is literally useless... Meh... Was still fun to make. \r<br />\r<br />So, the more astute of you will notice I uploaded another file to the page, not quite labeled like the others.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Rumor control, here are the facts...\r<br />[/i]\r<br />So I got really bored and created a stupid little utility that will populate a batch file with IncPcs commands for all skills, [b]at once.[/b]..\r<br />\r<br />Having said that, The text file that this program spits out will be as long as you want it to. This program can handle putting it together, but your text editor (&#39;notepad&#39; by default) is going to have a devil of a time opening it. Mine pooped out by the 100k skill level mark.\r<br />\r<br />Skill level 100&#39;s file will be about 79KB and about 1,800 lines.\r<br />Skill level 1000&#39;s file will be about 793 KB and about 18,000 lines.\r<br />Skill level 10k&#39;s file will be about 7.9 MB and about 180,000 lines.\r<br />Skill level 100k&#39;s file will be about 79 MB and about 1.8 million lines.\r<br />Skill level 1M&#39;s file will be about 793 MB and a whopping 18 million lines of code...\r<br />\r<br />I haven&#39;t gone bigger than that, honestly. I don&#39;t know about you, but I&#39;m kind of excited to see what Skyrim does with a 79 MB batch file with almost 2 million lines... It will probably crash... \r<br />\r<br />Most likely it will crash, but in the meantime... WHEEEEE&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />[/spoiler]Update Entries, click Spoiler...\r<br />[spoiler]\r<br />[b]UPDATE:[/b] As of 4/10/16, I am resuming active development for Torvus. My apologies for the lapse in development, anyone who is married with a child will know the constant struggle for free time and the demands of a full time career. *ugh* The next release, I hope to have out in a few weeks and will include;\r<br />[b]*[/b] fixes for the skills (a few of them were mis-nammed)\r<br />[b]*[/b] Incremental skill level ups\r<br />[b]* [/b]Support for custom plugins[b]\r<br />*[/b] nicer interface[b]\r<br />*[/b] quest grouping [b]\r<br />[/spoiler]\r<br />In order to accomplish the new release, Torvus is going to be completely redesigned from the ground up, and I have a few more surprises in addition to what I&#39;ve already listed here for new features. \r<br />\r<br />[/b]Would be nice to develop this application professionally for Bethesda Softworks to be incorporated into the next Creation Kit... Todd Howard, I&#39;m looking at you, good sir... As always, bug reports and suggestions on the forum below or hit me up at bane@savrasbane.com.\r<br />\r<br />Breath and Focus,\r<br />Bane[b]\r<br />\r<br />------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Can YOU think of a feature that Torvus lacks?[/b] Shoot me an email at bane@savrasbane.com or leave a post on the discussion below. I really want to make this program better.\r<br />\r<br />The current version has a custom list editor, searchable lists as well as other bells and whistles.
