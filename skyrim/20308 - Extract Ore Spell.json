  "descriptionHtml": "As a mage i hate manual labor & mining just really annoys me. If this was SWTOR i would tell my companion to do it, but since u cant i made this mod to make mining faster & not have to carry around a heavy pickaxe all the time.\r\n\r\n---DESCRIPTION---\r\nThis mod adds an alteration spell to the game called Extract Ore that can be used to mine ore. To use it just point & shoot at ore veins to start mining. You can buy the spell tome from adept alteration spell sellers i.e Tolfdir or u can find the spell tome in Halted Stream Camp next Transmute spell tome.\r\n\r\nThis mod was inspired by Mining Flames by Vonwarr.\r\n\r\nA great mod to use with this is Mining Extended by NiMayne aka Donald Love\r\n\r\n---COMPATIBILITY---\r\nThis mod is incompatible with bound pickaxe mods such as midas magic & also incompatible with Mining Flames.\r\n\r\n---INSTALL---\r\nUse NMM or place .esp into Data directory.\r\n\r\n---UNISTALL---\r\nUse NMM or remove .esp from Data directory.",
