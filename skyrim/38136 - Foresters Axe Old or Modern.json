  "descriptionHtml": "Heya, this is the new Foresters Axe, modeled in Blender, textures photographed and\r\nedited in Photoshop CS6 by me!\r\n\r\nREAD THIS:\r\nThe axe isent actually placed in the map, you have to craft it, or to cget it via console!\r\nHeres the console command:  \r\n\r\nplayer.additem 13000D63 1\r\n\r\nChanges for 1.1:\r\n-fixed that the axe was invisible in-game (thanks to ForestTech for reporting ans solving this bug)\r\n\r\nYesterday I remembered that this model was still on my external harddrive, used two years\r\nago as a movie asset, for a private film project.. So, finally, I thought, this must be in Skyrim,\r\nand here it is!\r\n\r\nI hope you will have some fun with it, if you find any bugs, report them to me, i will\r\nsee if I can fix them!\r\nCritic is very very welcome, please tell me what you think about the Foresters Axe:)",
