  "descriptionHtml": "There are many Types of the Mace in Skyrim but I have always wanted a Mace like a Sword, Also Called a \\\"BAR MACE\\\" So I made one myself and I like to Share it with you . Well here it is - This is a Real Medieval Weapon and was used in the Middle Age to kill and it Breaks Skulls easily. Hope you like it !\r\n\r\nThe Original Stats from the Creation Kit are : \r\n\r\nCritical Damage 8\r\nDamage 20\r\nDamage per Second 16\r\n\r\n\r\nThese Stats are individual and depend on your Characters Perks and Skills ! For me it makes 60 Damage because my Perks and Skills are at the Maximum ! So dont compare the Stats from the Screenshots to yours ! \r\n\r\nYou can craft it at any Forge in the Iron Section.. No DLC needed !\r\n\r\nEndorsments are Welcome ! Thank you *\r\n\r\nCredits to Nexus and Bethesda !\r\n\r\nEnjoy",
