  "descriptionHtml": "A clean and elegant retexture of cmdo\\'s [url=\\\"http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=634\\\"]Moonstone Elven Armour and Weapons[/url]. \r\n\r\nI always thought that the Elven Armor had an old and battered look that didn\\'t match the appearance of a newly crafted piece of armor... actually it looked like you just looted it from a flooded dungeon and you just had to remove the decaying corpse of the previous owner from inside the pieces.\r\n\r\nThe retex made by cmdo was an excelent approach to what I think the armor should look, but I missed the golden look of the original. Then, using cmdo\\'s retex, I played a little with colours and saturation, and the result is this: A clean, golden armor with black leather and red fabric details. Simple yet elegant, and also the weapons textures saturation was changed to match the armor.\r\n\r\nI really hope you like it ;)",
