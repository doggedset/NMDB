  "summary": "=DRAGONBORN AND DAWNGUARD REQUIRED=\r\n\r\nA mod which adjusts the vanilla shout \\\"Elemental Fury\\\" into a power worthy of Kynareth\\'s blessed Dragonborn...",
  "descriptionHtml": "Partially inspired by both the Windrunners found in Brandon Sanderson\\'s Stormlight Archive series and the Dragoon job class of Final Fantasy, Fury Of The Elements transforms the vanilla Elemental Fury shout from an occasional-use shout into an asset capable of enhancing the gameplay experience of any melee-oriented Dovahkiin.\r\n\r\nThis mod is very much an in-development piece, the result of a dissatisfaction with the effect of the vanilla Elemental Fury. After all, the Voice was supposedly a gift from Kyne bestowed upon the moral realm. Why would the shout which draws upon Kynareth\\'s element be no more special than a weapon attack multiplier?\r\n\r\nThis mod utilises several visuals from the new Dragonborn DLC as well as several special effects made possible by the recent CK updates, along with scripting techniques and CK manipulation I have only just figured out how to utilise effectively. There are several features I would like to implement, but have not yet been able to achieve successfully. If you believe you can help with these desires, let me know through the comments and I\\'ll try to implement these changes.\r\n\r\n[b][u]The Shout[/u][/b]\r\n\r\n[b][i]- Su (Air) -[/b][/i]  \r\n-Cooldown : 30 sec-\r\nMovement speed is increased by 15%\r\nWeapon swing speed is increased by 15%\r\nFall Damage is decreased by 80%\r\nIncoming Damage from bows is reduced by 40%\r\n\r\n[b][i]- Grah (Battle) - [/b][/i]\r\n-Cooldown : 45 sec-\r\nMovement speed is increased by 30%\r\nWeapon swing speed is increased by 30%\r\nFall damage is reduced by 95%\r\nIncoming Damage from bows is reduced by 70%\r\nSprinting knocks aside enemies in a short radius (Drains 30 Stamina and Magicka per second when used)*\r\nEnables Water Walking\r\n\r\n[b][i]- Dun (Grace) - [/b][/i]\r\n-Cooldown : 60 sec-\r\nMovement speed is increased by 50%\r\nWeapon swing speed is increased by 50%\r\nFall damage is reduced by 95%\r\nIncoming Damage from bows is reduced by 90%\r\nSprinting knocks aside enemies in a short radius (Drains 30 Stamina and Magicka per second when used)*\r\nEnables Water Walking\r\nNon-stationary Power Attacks launch opponents into the air\r\n\r\n\r\n*When you start sprinting, the screen will flash and a sound will play to indicate that you have been \\\"Windblessed,\\\" meaning you\\'ll knock down any enemies you run into while sprinting. Blocking while sprinting is [i]not[/i] required.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Compatibility & Recommended Mods[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nFury Of The Elements will work with any other Shout-altering mods; just place FotE below the other mod in the load order. I reccommend using FotE alongside [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27531] Dragon Soul Relinquishment[/url] by Alek and [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17010] Dragonborn Ascendant[/url] by Madcat221 for the ultimate Dovahkiin experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Plans for future versions:[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nScaling jump height modifier for all levels of the shout\r\n-This requires SKSE scriptwork, and I have no exemplars to help me figure out how to perform such a function.\r\n\r\nThanks for using, and don\\'t forget to endorse if you enjoy it!\r\n-Daedalus A.I.-",
