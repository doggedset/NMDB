INFORMATION ON THE MOD           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   This mod makes it so Vampires get weaker when they do not feed.\r\n\r\n\t   This comparatively simple mod reverses how Skyrim vampires are, to make them more\r\nlike traditional vampires from books and movies.  The vampires get strong when they feed \r\nand weak when they can\\'t feed enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t   A vampire who has just barely fed will be like this:\r\n\r\nHave a powerful Drain spell.\r\nHave a powerful Raise Thrall greater power.\r\nHave a powerful unarmed combat ability.\r\nHave the Vampire\\'s Seduction Charm greater power.\r\nHave the Embrace of Shadows invisibility greater power.\r\nHave a great resistance to frost.\r\nBe able to associate with people without scaring them.\r\nHave a small weakness to fire.\r\nHave a small weakness to sunlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t   A vampire who is starving will be like this:\r\n\r\nHave a weak Drain spell.\r\nHave a weak Raise Thrall greater power.\r\nHave a weak unarmed combat ability.\r\nHave lost the ability to use the Vampire\\'s Seduction Charm greater power.\r\nHave lost the ability to use the Embrace of Shadows invisibility greater power.\r\nHave a small resistance to frost.\r\nInability to associate with people without scaring them.  Get attacked on sight.\r\nHave a great weakness to fire.\r\nHave a great weakness to sunlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t   For all stages of vampirism, weakness to sunlight has been doubled in intensity.\r\nIn my opinion, vampires should not be able to run around in the sun freely.\r\n\r\n\t   In Version 1_0, players who become vampires become part of the Vampire Faction \r\nand will not be automatically attacked by vampires and other undead they meet in dungeons.  \r\nIf cured of vampirism, they are removed from the faction.\r\n\r\n\t   In Version 1_0_B, players are not added to the vampire faction when they become\r\nvampires, and still get attacked by other vampires and undead that they meet in dungeons.\r\n\r\n\t   This is just a fairly simple vampirism tweaks mod that does not make a whole bunch \r\nof changes and add a whole bunch of content like some vampire mods do. \r\n************************************************************************\r\n2. Installation                           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n           Extract (decompress) the .esp and Scripts folder to your Skyrim directory.  \r\n(It will be something like *Installation directory*\\\\Skyrim\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data)\r\nMark the box next to the Vampirism Inverter.esp in your mod manager.\r\n \r\n           Alternately, extract files someplace else.  Then move the .esp and Scripts folder \r\nto Skyrim\\\\Data.  Mark the box next to the plugin in your mod manager.\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstallation:\r\n\r\n\t   This mod edits the vanilla Skyrim script \\\"PlayerVampireQuestScript.\\\"  To remove this\r\nmod, you need to remove both the .esp and the script.  Find it at: \r\nskyrim\\\\Data\\\\Scripts\\\\PlayerVampireQuestScript.pex.  \r\n************************************************************************\r\n3. Version History    \r\n************************************************************************\r\nV 1.0.B  3/13/12   Variant B does not add the player to the vampire faction on becoming a vampire,\r\n\t   \t   so other vampires and undead creatures will still attack the player if this \r\n\t\t   variant is used. \r\nV 1.0    3/11/12   Initial release.   \r\n************************************************************************\r\n4. Conflicts, Known Issues, and Troubleshooting\r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   This mod will conflict with any other vampirism tweak or overhaul mod you can download.\r\nYou need to just choose the one you like best and use it.  You can\\'t be using two or three.\r\n\r\n\t   Vampirism in The Elder Scrolls games is pretty lame.  It would have been nicer if it \r\nhad been done in a more traditional fashion.  Vampirism in Skyrim is so far from the norm that it\r\nis hard to mod it into being the way it ought to be.\r\n\r\n\t   Weakness to sunlight in Skyrim is pretty pathetic.  I would like to figure out how to \r\nhave it be a constant effect that hurts you and removes more and more health points as long as you \r\nare out in the sun where vampires do not belong. \r\n\r\n\t   Non-hostile vampires you meet in dungeons don\\'t have much to say.\r\n\r\n\t   If you use version 1_0, being in the Vampire Faction means that things like draugr, \r\nskeletons, spiders, and wolves get along with you and are your friends.  If you don\\'t want it to\r\nbe this way, use version 1_0_B which does not add you to the vampire faction.\r\n\r\n\t   There are a lot of other mods like this one already.  You may find one of them to be \r\nmore to your liking than this one.  This mod is just available to give you another option.\r\n\r\n\t   This mod needs more testing over the long term under a variety of conditions.\r\n\t\r\n\t   If you locate a bug, contact David Brasher on TES Nexus so that the situation can be\r\nexamined and can hopefully be fixed. \r\n************************************************************************\r\n5.
