  "summary": "Mosha is an Orc. I noticed there are not a lot of Orcish followers, so I made her.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://oi42.tinypic.com/2w4y2wh.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nMosha dual-weilds one-handed orcish axes, and carries an orcish bow with arrows. She tried learning magic at The College of Winterhold, but it was too difficult for her, so now she studies in The Arcaneum.\r\n\r\nThe orcish armor is more revealing because I have the UNP body and an armor replacer that makes the armor skimpier.\r\n\r\nThis mod requires ApachiiSkyHair, her hair isn't vanilla. If you want a vanilla hair version, ask.\r\n\r\nHer warpaint should show up. If it doesn't, let me know.\r\n\r\nCheck out my other follower, [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36349/]Brenn[/url]!\r\nAlso, check out [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/46043/?]Lorae and Kayla[/url].\r\n\r\n[i]If you like my followers, please endorse them! It shows me that I'm doing a good job as a beginner modder, and that you'd like me to continue trying to make mods![/i]\r\n\r\nCredit goes to Bethesda!\r\nAnd to Apachii, for the hair mod.",
