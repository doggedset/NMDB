  "descriptionHtml": "The Nightingale Bow and Nord Hero Bow are both set to have a noise level equal to that of the larger one-handed weapons, like swords and maces. This file sets their noise level down to Silent, like the rest of the bows in the game.\r\n\r\nWith their noise level at Normal, as it is without this mod, enemies at close or medium range detect what would be a sneak attack almost instantly, nullifying the sneak attack bonus and putting the PC into detected status.",
