  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3][color=lightblue]Alternate Starting Factions (by Volek)[/color][/size]\r\n\r\nEach of these plugins let you skip the whole execution scene and the Helgen Keep dungeon. You start at a selected location for that faction, with faction-related equipment and spells.\r\nI tried to keep faction relations lore-friendly, eg. Forsworn are enemies of Stormcloaks, but friends of Hagravens.\r\n\r\nThe following starts are available:\r\n\r\n[u]Bandit 1.2[/u]\r\n* You are a Bandit who lives in Fort Hraggstad.\r\n* There are some crafting tools in the hall.\r\n* A member of the Thieves Guild lives here too, she buys and sells loot.\r\n* Bandits are your friends. Most other people are your enemies. Members of the Thieves Guild and the Dark Brotherhood are neutral.\r\n* You can take one Bandit with you. Your follower will trade items and execute orders.\r\n\r\n[u]Forsworn 1.2[/u]\r\n* You are a Forsworn who lives in Druadach Redoubt Cave.\r\n* A new alchemy table and armor workbench are available here.\r\n* One of the Forsworn in the cave trades loot and stuff.\r\n* Forsworns and Hagravens are your friends. People of the Reach, Stormcloaks and their friends are your enemies.\r\n* You can take one Forsworn with you. Your follower will trade items and execute orders.\r\n\r\n[u]Silver Hand 1.2[/u]\r\n* You are a member of the Silver Hands, your base of operations is Gallows Rock.\r\n* You own a Silver Sword and Leather Armor.\r\n* You can trade loot with the quartermaster in the entry hall.\r\n* Other Silver Hands are your friends. People of Whiterun, Companions and Werewolves are your enemies.\r\n* You can take one Silver Hand with you. Your follower will trade items and execute orders.\r\n\r\n[u]Thalmor 1.2[/u]\r\n* You are a member of the Thalmor, stationed in Northwatch Keep.\r\n* The new Quartermaster in the second room will buy and sell items.\r\n* Other Thalmor are your friends. Stormcloaks are your enemies.\r\n* You can take one Northwatch Guard with you. Your companion will follow orders and trade items.\r\n\r\n[u]Necromancer 1.4[/u]\r\n* You are a novice Necromancer who lives in Fort Snowhawk.\r\n* A merchant lives there too. He will buy your loot, and sell random items.\r\n* Other Necromancers, Warlocks, Draugr and Skeletons are your friends. Vigilants of Stendarr, Thalmor and the people of Solitude are your enemies.\r\n* You can take one Necromancer and Skeleton with you. Your companions will follow orders and trade items.\r\n\r\n[u]Witch 1.2[/u]\r\n* You are a Witch, you are living in the hut at Witchmist Grove.\r\n* There\\'s an Alchemy lab in the hut, and a chest to store your ingredients.\r\n* You are able to cast simple magic from various schools.\r\n* At the Grove, you can meet a Witch who will buy your loot.\r\n* Other Witches and Hagravens are your friends. Vigilants of Stendarr are your enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll files include a Scripts folder. Install this folder too, otherwise the follower dialogue won\\'t work.\r\nThe main quest is disabled by default, but if you want to play it anyway, you have to delete the file Data/Scripts/QF_MQ101_0003372B.pex. After character creation you will be asked if you sided with Stormcloaks or Imperials, which after a while will trigger the beginning of the Main Quest (talk to Gerdur or Alvor).\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion History:\r\n1.2 - added follower dialogue, some minor bug fixes\r\n1.1 - added merchants and crafting tools to start locations\r\n1.0 - First CK release. No ini editing required, faction relations are now working\r\n0.2 - added Thalmor and Necromancer\r\n0.1 - initial release, required skyrim.ini editing\r\n\r\n\r\nNo permission needed to create mods based on this one, but you must give credit and send me a message.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to valery93 and toaDime, and to all the people who posted their ideas for this mod.",
