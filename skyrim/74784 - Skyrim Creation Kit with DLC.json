  "descriptionHtml": "This is a modified version of the SkyrimEditor.ini file that will allow you to load the DLC&#39;s in the Skyrim Creation Kit. This was used by me to create the mod &#34;DLC Shrines in Skyrim Worldspace&#34; (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74666/?), and I combined elements from five different forums and tutorials to do the right modifications in order for the ini-file to work properly, because of my earlier difficulties with making this work, I&#39;ve decided to share my version of the SkyrimEditor.ini with you.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b]Installation instructions (Important&#33;&#33;&#33;)[/b]\r<br />[size=2]1. Only manual installation, no mod organizing tools can treat this as this is not a plugin&#33;\r<br />2. Backup your SkyrimEditor.ini (SkyrimEditor) so that you can use that again of my ini-file does not work for you.\r<br />[/size][/size][size=2]3. Download[/size]\r<br />\r<br />4. Copy/extract the SkyrimEditor.ini (or just SkyrimEditor, dending on your system) into the main Skyrim folder (not the Data folder&#33;) (ProgramFilesx86/Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim) - if you use Steam\r<br />\r<br />5. Allow this file to replace your existing SkyrimEditor.ini (Don&#39;t worry, you have a backup, right?)\r<br />\r<br />6. Launch you Skyrim Creation Kit and enjoy using resources from all the DLC&#39;s when you create mods.\r<br />[b]\r<br />[/b][size=4][b]Requirements[/b]\r<br />[size=2]1. All the official DLC&#39;s, Dawnguard, Dragonborn and Hearthfires, if you don&#39;t have all of them you must open the ini file, scroll down to the archive section, and remove any names where the DLC&#39;s you do not have are mentioned[/size][/size], or you could by the ones you don&#39;t have (That&#39;s what I would recommend ;p)\r<br />\r<br />2. Skyrim Creation Kit - if you don&#39;t have this installed you should still have a copy if you bought this on Steam. CheckÂ  Libary/Tools (as this is a tool, not a game)\r<br />\r<br />[i]\r<br />If you experience any issues, please let me know in the comments or send me a message. Also consider removing my ini-file and use your backup instead if my file causes problems.[/i]",
