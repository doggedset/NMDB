When I was a kid my parents were in a elite group of Brentons to find out the true plans of the High elves unfortunately for me they were caught and killed and I was sold into slavery. The family I was sold to treated me like trash, The family made me sleep outside with the animals, they were awful. I ate with the pigs because to them I was less than human,to them I was a waste of life.  I was their slave for 7 years before I did what any sensible person would do I killed them, all, then set everything they owned on fire and never looked back. From that point forward I always hated elfs. I could never trust them, there all the same to me. I hid from them in skyrim I trained myself with the Bow hunting anything…. or anyone. For 3 years I stayed in the forest hunting until I found Falkreath. When I was there everyone knew what it felt like to be hurt, so I stayed and this is where I wait.\r<br /> \r<br />\r<br />- looking for female voice actor if interested contact me @ brandonjeremiah808@gmail.com\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I would like to thank:\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;apachii for http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;LogRaam for http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722/?\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;dimon99 for http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6709/?\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Xenius for http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30/?\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;hellosanta for http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35267/?\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;hellosanta for http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35327/?\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;mrLenski for http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/4869/?\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;navetsea for http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6554/?\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Xenius for http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/689/?\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;brokefoot for http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31813/?\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;newmiller for http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/46696/?\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;anaka01 for http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48652/?\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />",
