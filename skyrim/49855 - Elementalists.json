  "descriptionHtml": "I saw a request for this once in a comments section and really liked the idea. I finally got around to making it. All of the details are in the images so I don't believe any information is required.\n<br />This is an addition and overhaul to the previous mod. This is standalone. All you need is Dawnguard.\n<br />\n<br />Also: This is NOT and easy mod. I would recommend level 50 or higher with a companion.\n<br />\n<br />Includes: \n<br />Chillrend: Full enchanted armor set with Bow and Dagger.\n<br />Flamerend: Full enchanted armor set with Bow and Dagger.\n<br />Shockrend: Full enchanted armor set with Bow and Dagger.\n<br />Also each set contains a familiar for their respective element.\n<br />\n<br />Enchantments have been toned down from the previous God-like armor.\n<br />\n<br />Chill-Wind Cave Location: Near Ivarstead. Check screenshots for precise location.\n<br />\n<br />Installation:\n<br />Files have been archived. Simply drop the ChillrendArmor.esp and ChillrendArmor.bsa into your data folder or use the NMM.\n<br />\n<br />Grumani was kind enough to message me after making some updates/fixes to the mod: His esp file has been added to the downloads. The following changes can be obtained by replacing the original esp with his esp which is provided in download version 1.1.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Cleaned in TES5Edit\n<br />[*]Deleted (re-numbered) navmesh returned to original ID and connected\n<br />[*]All shields have ‘light armor’ keyword added so they show up as light armor\n<br />[*]All shock weapons have craftable item entries added, so they can be upgraded at a grinding wheel, with appropriate recipes\n<br />[*]All flame weapons have craftable item entries added, so they can be upgraded at a grinding wheel, with appropriate recipes\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />*****IMPORTANT*****\n<br />If you have previously installed the Chillrend Armor mod (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49191/?)\n<br />you must remove it before installing this.",
