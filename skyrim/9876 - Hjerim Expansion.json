Recently added the ability to store scrolls on shelves, But is in need of work in that respect. Excellent mod&#33; \r<br />\r<br />2. Alchemy Ingredient Storage http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8431 Adds an alchemy satchel to all the player houses in skyrim. Has the ability to &#34;store all&#34;,\r<br />&#34;keep one&#34; or &#34;keep three&#34; ingredients with just one click. Works great, Excellent mod&#33;\r<br />\r<br />3. Nirnroots Silenced http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=1497 Self explanitory, Excellent mod works great.\r<br />\r<br />4. Spouses can live everywhere http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11370 Useful if you have a spouse in-game and are wanting them to make hjerim their home. \r<br />\r<br />If you enjoy this mod, please endorse it ;-)\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=red][B][U]Installation:[/B][/U][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Copy the hjerimexpansion.esp file to your skyrim data folder.Open your skyrim launcher and under &#34;data files&#34; ensure the hjerimexpansion file is checked. Also create a save OUTSIDE of hjerim to start off with this mod. After a fresh install loading a previous save in hjerim is preventing some items from relocating properly. Also, leaving hjerim without proper install can cause crashes.\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=red][B][U]Troubleshooting :[/B][/U][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />1. If your already living in hjerim this mod wont effect your items other than having to pickup and re place any items in the sword/sheild display plaque as well as the display case at the top of the stairs. They will be floating in their original locations in the middle of the room after install.\r<br />\r<br />Solution - Collect the floating weapons and place them into the displays again. This will correct the floating weapons bug.\r<br />\r<br />2. There are items and objects that are not moved to their correct positions within the house.\r<br />\r<br />Solution - This is caused by a bugged save game. Remove all your items from the house, Exit the house and save your game outside. Be 100% sure to save as you will want a backup in case things go wrong. Enter the console using the &#34;~&#34; key, Type the following: ResetInterior WindhelmHjerim (hit enter) ResetInterior WindhelmHjerim2 (hit enter) PCB (hit enter) If succesful, this will reset both parts of the house to default condition aswell as clear any saved cell information from memory. If this is not sucessful, reload your previous backed up save.(Also if you enter the console and type: TGM (press enter) you will enter god mode, This is useful to eliminate encumbrance while holding all your items. TGM again to disable)\r<br />\r<br />3. My mannequins are whack\r<br />\r<br />Solution - I have done my best to perfect the navmesh under the mannequins, There are several bethesda bugs associated with mannequins, Most of the time placing armor into their inventory will reset their location. I have found a mod which fixes these bugs, link is above.\r<br />\r<br />Also if anyone comes across any bugs, please let me know in the comments and I will address them asap :-)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />",
