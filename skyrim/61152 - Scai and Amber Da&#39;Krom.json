If not following will attack player but will accept infinite yields (if you attack them).\r<br />- Armor/Weapons are custom, don&#39;t weigh anything in inventory, and are now included thanks to ChronoTrigger77&#33;\r<br />- Two very different attack styles\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][u]Description:[/u][/size]\r<br />These two followers don&#39;t really have a storyline- I&#39;ve just started &#34;coding&#34; with Creation Kit. They can be found in Riverwood Sleeping Giant Inn &#33;~cocRiverwoodSleepingGiantInn. All you need to do is approach them and ask them to follow you. They are invincible, so there will be no more &#34;accidental&#34; spell/arrow hits that cause the final death of these two. Regardless of how many times you attack them, they won&#39;t ever attack you back (while following), but they will leave your service and head back to riverwood. They can be told to follow you again immediately, however. If they are not following you, they will attack back however, they will accept any and all yields (sheathing weapons/spells).\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff][size=3]Both sisters&#39; armor and weapons weigh nothing, giving you the most space out of their inventory. You can [b][u]not[/u][/b] take their weapons/armor as they have custom enchantments on them and are part of a custom set.\r<br />\r<br />Scai Da&#39;Krom&#39;s attack style is sword and shield, blocking then attacking. When presented with a ranged target, she will pull out her custom glass bow to take targets down. She is not as good as Amber at taking aggro, but will be able to snipe targets with her bow.\r<br />\r<br />Amber Da&#39;Krom&#39;s attack style is dual daedric swords. She [b]does not use ranged[/b] ever, instead she&#39;ll charge in with both swords out and rapidly attack targets. She is better for taking aggro and can be built up to an unstoppable war machine.\r<br />\r<br />The followers start at level 5 and level with the player up to level 65. (Past level 65 and Amber is too OP&#39;d)[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=3][u]Requirements for 3.3:[/u][/size][/color]\r<br />HDT Physics - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53996\r<br />CBBE Beautiful Bodies - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666\r<br />XPMS Extended Skeleton - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26800\r<br />Realistic Ragdolls and Force - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/601\r<br />SKSE is required - http://skse.silverlock.org/\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=3][u]Installation for 3.3:[/u][/size][/color]\r<br />Download all mods listed above + this mod; install in this order.

It requires all the mods listed in [u]Requirements 3.1[/u] to work properly. It is a Beta since Amber doesn&#39;t wear underwear and Scai is suffering from a neck seam. [b]PM IF HAVING THIS ISSUE&#33;~&#33;~&#33;~&#33;[/b]\r<br />[color=#00ffff]\r<br />3.0[/color] is a vanilla armor version. It won&#39;t look like the picture above until you install ChronoTrigger77&#39;s armor + all dependencies & ApachiiSkyHair, then it will look like that picture.\r<br />[color=#00ff00]\r<br />[/color]If you have a brown face bug (their faces are brown and their bodies are normal colored) then follow the steps from the following two options below to fix. [color=#00ff00]SHOULD BE FIXED IN VER 3.0+ IF NOT [b]PM A.S.A.P PLEASE&#33; Don&#39;t forget to tell me version used, mods used, and loot order&#33; Thanks&#33;[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />::Option 1::\r<br />1. Open Creation Kit\r<br />2. Check Skyrim and set &#34;CustomFollowerSet2.8&#34; to active file - IN VER 3.0- Will require ApachiiSkyHair as Dependency&#33; MUST DOWNLOAD For this option&#33;\r<br />3. Select Actors tab and type &#34;Custom&#34;\r<br />4. On CustomFollowerAmber left click, then press ctrl + F4\r<br />5. On CustomFollowerScai left click, then press ctrl + F4\r<br />6. A message from each should pop up saying done\r<br />7. Close & Play\r<br />\r<br />::Option 2::\r<br />1. Open Nexus Mod Manager\r<br />2. Choose to &#34;open NMM&#39;s Mod Folder&#34; with the Folder icon in the top left bar\r<br />3. Choose to &#34;open Game Folder&#34; with the same icon\r<br />4. In NMM&#39;s Mod Folder, locate &#34;CustomFollowerSetBC.zip&#34; and open \r<br />5. In Skyrim game folder navigate to &#34;&#92;Data&#92;textures&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;FaceGenData&#92;FaceTint&#34;\r<br />6.

Close & Play\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][u][color=#00ff00]UPDATES:[/color]\r<br />[/u][/size]2.8 - after quite a bit of testing out fighting styles and armor sets + armor mods, etc decided to stick with this file to upload\r<br />2.9 - thought I had fixed the brown face bug; file had hanging textures from other mods\r<br />3.0 - fixed all hanging textures\r<br />[color=#00ff00]3.1[/color] - armor is now included & was tested for consistency: does not affect ChronoTrigger77&#39;s original mod should have complete compatibility. [color=#00ff00]Please PM if issues are found&#33;[/color]\r<br />[color=#ff7700]3.3[/color] - neck seam with Scai is fixed - PM IF STILL HAVING ISSUES&#33;&#33; Both still refuse to wear underwear- maybe they&#39;re trying to tell me something O_o... Apachii has granted permission to use the hair in my mod&#33;&#33; W00T W00T&#33; Comin&#39; along nicely. Anyway, super awesome, again, thank you.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][u]Consistency Issues (Conflicting Mods):[/u][/size]\r<br />[color=#ffff00]Do not use [b][u]Alternate Actors[/u][/b] on any of the followers IN THIS MOD[/color]. [color=#00ff00]You can use alternate actors with this mod[/color], but don&#39;t use alternate actors on any of the characters in this mod. This is because the armor and weapons are NON playable&#33; That means you can&#39;t use &#39;em&#33; Alternate actors won&#39;t load a character that has non-playable weapons/armor/items in their inventory&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Any other consistency based issues would be found if you don&#39;t follow installation.\r<br />If you have any consistency issues with 3.1/3.3, uninstall 3.1/3.3 and install 3.0&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; This will fix any issues with 3.1/3.3 and your mods&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][u][color=#ff0000]Known Bugs:[/color]\r<br />[/u][/size]3.1 Neck seam issue on Scai - Amber is fine... Dunno about this issue, working on it currently. If anyone knows a work-around would be glad for help :)\r<br />3.1 Amber&#39;s underwear meshes didn&#39;t transfer properly so she&#39;ll be &#34;free-balling&#34; for a while til I figure this out\r<br />3.3 Neck seam fixed: Both still refuse to put their underwear on -__-\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00]Do not de-activate the plugin without first taking everything from follower&#39;s inventory and dissmissing follower.[/color]\r<br />If you forget to do this, open the console (in game) and type &#34;set playerfollowercount to 0&#34; press enter. This will let you have a follower again.",
