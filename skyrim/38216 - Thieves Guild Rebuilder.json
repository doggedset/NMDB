  "descriptionHtml": "[center]On my first character, I quickly learned that grinding 125 side jobs to get all of the the trophies was not something I wanted to do again. So, I quickly threw this file together.\r<br />\r<br />By running the bat command in Skyrim&#39;s console, you can execute multiple commands at once. \r<br />\r<br />-Installation-\r<br />Download RebuildGuild.rar\r<br />Unzip with WinZip, SevenZip, WinRar or whichever unzipping utility you use.\r<br />Place RebuildGuild.txt into Skyrim&#39;s base installation directory, NOT the Data folder.\r<br />For 64 bit users, it should look something like Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;skyrim.\r<br />Once in game, open the console with the tilde key (~) if you&#39;re using an American keyboard. I don&#39;t know what key it is for foreign keyboards.\r<br />Depending on which file you have downloaded, type either of the following- &#34;bat RebuildGuild&#34; or &#34;bat RebuildGuildV2&#34; without the quotation marks.\r<br />Press Enter then press the tilde key again to close the console.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=5][b]\r<br />Version Differences[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][b]~RebuildGuildV1~[/b][/color]\r<br />This text file contains the commands to:\r<br />\r<br />Complete the Markarth, Windhelm, Whiterun and Solitude special quests. These will add the Armorer, Apothecary, Blacksmith, and Bowyer to the Ragged Flagon as well as two Thieves Guild Recruits.\r<br />\r<br />Trigger the eight completion stages for completing 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 75 and 125 jobs to unlock the trophies. These trophies appear on the shelf behind the Guild Master&#39;s desk. They are the Jeweled Candlestick, Ornate Drinking Horn, Golden Ship Model, Golden Urn, Jeweled Goblet, Jeweled Pitcher, Jeweled Flagon and a safe that contains random items and money.\r<br />[color=#00ff00][b]\r<br />~RebuildGuildV2~[/b][/color]\r<br />This file contaisn the commands to:\r<br />\r<br />Activate the Markarth, Windhelm, Whiterun and Solitude special quests but does not complete them. This file is for the people who want to actually play those quests, rather than skip them.\r<br />\r<br />Trigger the eight completion stages for completing 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 75 and 125 jobs to unlock the trophies. These trophies appear on the shelf behind the Guild Master&#39;s desk. They are the Jeweled Candlestick, Ornate Drinking Horn, Golden Ship Model, Golden Urn, Jeweled Goblet, Jeweled Pitcher, Jeweled Flagon and a safe that contains random items and money.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Th[b]ese[/b] files do not give the Stones of Berenziah nor does it give you the items you sell to Devlin for Litany of Larceny that you can find while doing the main Guild quests. This is done for two reasons. The first is that I like doing these myself and the second is that item spawn codes are dependent on which if any DLC you have installed.[/center]",
