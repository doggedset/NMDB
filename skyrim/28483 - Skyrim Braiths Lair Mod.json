  "descriptionHtml": "Hello this is a cool braith fun mod.\r\nBefore we get started i would recommend getting KILLABLE CHILDREN MOD as I am not sure if you can kill the braiths without it :P. This mod was made for MMOxReview because he hates braith + I think it is just so fun killing massive braiths for fun! I am a  modder and this is my first ever mod. If you think it sucks then fine :S. \r\n\r\nTo get to the braith lair!\r\n---------------------------------\r\nTo get to the braith lair you must type in on the console coc braithlair  and to leave type coc riverwood. There is also another lair but it is still in work progress. To get to the work in progress one type coc braithslairofepic and to return type coc riverwood\r\n\r\nAdded Npcs\r\n------------------\r\nBraith Master\r\nBraith Kill-Kid\r\n\r\nthank you and enjoy the mod :D\r\nmod by: philanross\r\n",
