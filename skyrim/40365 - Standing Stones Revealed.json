  "descriptionHtml": "Simply reveals the map markers of all Standing Stones. Nothing more, nothing less.\r\n\r\nNow you don\\'t have to remember where those Stones are every time you start a new character or alt-tab to UESP anymore. For me it was just too annoying having to find them every time I start a new character so I never got around to trying them, but now I will.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\nDrag-n-drop the .esp to your Skyrim folder and enable it with your favorite mod manager.\r\n\r\nYou can remove the .esp whenever put I\\'m pretty sure the map markers will remain revealed. That\\'s just how they work.\r\n\r\nPut it in your load order BEFORE any map overhauls like Warburg\\'s Paper Map.\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n=============\r\nCompatible with everything.\r\n\r\nPermissions\r\n===========\r\nYou can do whatever you want with my mods as long as you credit me and provide a link to the original mod. Let me know if you have plans for any of my mods.",
