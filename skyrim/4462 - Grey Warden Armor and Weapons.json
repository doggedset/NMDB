The installed version is, the new version is.\",\n<br />and it asks you \"Would you like to upgrade?\", also it says you \"Selecting NO it will the new Mod normally\", you should click NO and not YES, it will keep the main file and will replace the update files over the main file.\n<br />\n<br />Its not hard to do it so! oo[/color]\n<br />\n<br />Authors: haldir307 \n<br />\n<br />Description:\n<br />Inspired from the Dragon Age Origins armor mod Grey Warden Runic Armor.\n<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/647/?\n<br />I retextured the steel plate armor/weapons, the cape of the Prometheus Capes and duplicated their meshes.\n<br />Its standalone, craftable in Steel section and the cape in misc section,\n<br />it have an issue that i don't know yet how to fix, its the cape, the position is not right on the shoulders,\n<br />can see in images, if its easy to fix with NifSkope, please someone explain me the steps how to fix it, thanks.\n<br />\n<br />Installation:\n<br />Extract \"Grey_Warden-Armor_and_Weapons\" and copy the folder \"Data\" to Program FilesSteamSteamAppscommonskyrim\n<br />\n<br />Run SkyrimLauncher, click to Data Files and checkmark the empty box of the GreyWarden.esp,\n<br />checkmark the empty box of Load Loose Files and click OK.\n<br />Attention please, if the Data Files section is grey and isn't working, go to this directory:\n<br />C:Users****DocumentsMy GamesSkyrim\n<br />and open SkyrimPrefs.ini, find the [Launcher] and type under of the last line,\n<br />those two lines exactly like they are:\n<br />bEnableFileSelection=1\n<br />bLoadLooseFiles=1\n<br />Save and close it, go back to SkyrimLauncher and enable the checkmarks i told before,\n<br />you are ready to enjoy the Grey Warden Armor and Weapons.\n<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />GW - Clipping Cape Fix\n<br />After i learned how to make texture parts invisible, today i thought that\n<br />it can work on the clipping issue of the cape over the shoulders,\n<br />so i tryed and it works, but in side views there may be little visible parts\n<br />which i do not know how to fix it, well, its not so bad, but better from before.\n<br />\n<br />Installation:\n<br />First you need the main file installed!\n<br />Extract \"GW - Clipping Cape Fix\" and copy the folders \"Meshes\" and \"Textures\"\n<br />to Program FilesSteamSteamAppscommonSkyrimData and replace all.\n<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />Permissions:\n<br />1) Users/Modders are not allowed to upload my files to other sites!\n<br />2) Users/Modders are not allowed to convert my file so that it works on similar games!\n<br />3) Users/Modders are not allowed to modify my file including releasing bug fixes or improving on the features my file adds to the game and upload it as a seperate file!\n<br />4) Users/Modders are not allowed to use assets contained in my files in their own files!\n<br />[b][i]5) Translations are allowed, no need to ask me. [/i][/b]\n<br />[b][i][u]6) Users/Modders are not allowed to upload my mods on Steam Workshop as their own to obtain money and it means the same for Permissions 2/3/4, my mods will always stay on nexus for free![/u][/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Credits:\n<br />Made by haldir307.",
