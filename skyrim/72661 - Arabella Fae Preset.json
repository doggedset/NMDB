Arabella Fae is the youngest child out of 5 siblings. She challenges that the only reason Abrianna was out before her, was because Abrianna cut in line at the very end.  She is a destruction and conjuration mage primarily in my game, and if I manage to figure out how to make custom followers, I shall make her that too.   Her mother is an Elf and her father a Nord.  Most noticeable traits from her parents is inheriting her father&#39;s more Nord-like facial features, eyes, ears, and hair color.  From her mother she gained her magic, smaller figure, and nurturing kindness.\r<br />\r<br />Thank you for your download and endorsement&#33;  Please be sure to post your images when you have time&#33;[/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][url=http://s151.photobucket.com/user/Eviejean87/media/Screenshot346629_zpsfcbvjoit.png.html][/url][url=http://s151.photobucket.com/user/Eviejean87/media/Skyrim/Screenshot57109_zpscmd0bx7m.jpg.html][img]http://i151.photobucket.com/albums/s152/Eviejean87/Skyrim/Screenshot57109_zpscmd0bx7m.jpg[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=5]\r<br />[/size][b][size=4][color=#6aa84f][size=5]Back Story:[/size][/color][/size][/b][/center][b][size=4][color=#6aa84f][u]\r<br />[/u][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=2]Arabella Fae meaning &#34;Beautiful Magic&#34;. Lady Amaltheia said the name as she looked from top to bottom at her dark haired little angel.  Jarl Árón looked to his two babies chuckling to himself, on how much they looked the same and yet already appeared to be opposites. One baby whom screeched and wiggled madly in his arms, Abrianna Skye they determined; and then the other [/size][size=2][b][size=4][size=2]while in her mother&#39;s embrace,[/size][/size][/b] cooed softly and squeezed gently at a loose lock of her hair.  Both parents regarded them with wide pride-filled smiles disbelieving their blessings of two babies at once. Árón leaned over Amaltheia kissing her forehead tenderly, then peered down at Arabella&#39;s sweet little face. Not only was the wee babe full of beautiful magic as they easily felt by her powerful aura that shined around her, but quite notable inner spirit too. [/size][size=2]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />As the twins grew, Amaltheia and Árón couldn&#39;t help but notice how utterly different they seemed to be. Though born together, they couldn&#39;t be more different in demeanor and temperament. Abrianna showed a fierce fire for life, always on the go to explore new things, and a need for perfecting her skills. \r<br />\r<br />Arabella like her sister sought perfection, but rather in her ability to control spells and enchantments. She approached life with a serene peace, stubbornness, and uncertainty in confidence.  She made time to laugh and to appreciate others, earning loyalty and love with ease.  She was always smiling, and trying to be idealistic of those doubting themselves. She liked to make people feel better, and in between the moral boosting- she made plenty of time to day dream and smell the flowers. \r<br />\r<br />So many times her family would notice the kindness that is Arabella... Amaltheia smiled to herself as she passed by the Dining Hall one day to see Arabella hugging a maid, who had been sitting alone in the Dining Hall crying.  The maid had already spoken to Lady Amaltheia, but now also spoke to Arabella; almost as if she couldn&#39;t help herself.  The maid had received a letter from the courier, that her son Klindir died a noble warriors death over seas. Arabella instinctively sensed the feelings of others; an empath skill; and sought to comfort the poor woman as best she could. \r<br />\r<br />As women both Arabella and Abrianna would hunt barefoot in the woods. Though Abrianna was the better tracker and hunter; Arabella would master levitation and calming spells to attract the animals to her, making all Abrianna&#39;s acrobatic attempts wasted. Arabella laughed as she saw her sister from afar sticking her tongue out at her- she would answer back doing the same thing.  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#6aa84f]❤[/color] [color=#38761D]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/color] [color=#6aa84f]❤[/color] [color=#38761D][b]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/b][/color] [color=#6aa84f]❤[/color] \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Arabella paced about her stone cage, hoping for weak openings or possible windows to climb out.  Most of the little windows appeared to be like a well with no light shining through.  Her breathing quickened as panic stewed inside her.After she was taken by the invading Thalmor, Arabella worried about her sister who went off alone into the woods. Abrianna had taken her special daggers- but usually ended up day dreaming about dragons and grand intrigues. Was she in danger now? Arabella prayed for her bold and fearless sister&#39;s safety, while missing the feel of her wonderful mother&#39;s hand that had comforted her before the guards separated them. \r<br />\r<br />She could smell death and rotting around her.  Despair clawed at her stoic expression, however she masked it well when the guards were near.  The faded sounds of moaning and screaming prisoners traveled down the dank dark hallways beyond her iron locked gate.Arabella&#39;s father had been wounded during the attack. He did all he could to defend and save his family from becoming captured. Nearly killed himself in fact, before a many mages stepped in and casted a spell in unison to paralyze and make them all sleep. A few times they awoke in a haze to see one another chained to the walls of a wagon, and then a ship. \r<br />\r<br />The Thalmor made sure to give them little chance to get away by forcing sleep spells on them in intervals. Her parents would fight their bindings with no avail, none the less they kept trying. Sadly the Thalmor were careful during this extraction point. They were organized.  Why did they take her and her parents? Why did they slaughter her friends and her people? The memory of their screams and suffering haunted the recesses of her mind; and stalking her once peaceful dreams.  She tried to heal her people when they fell by their enemies blades. But it was always too late by the time she got to their side, their eyes once full of life suddenly empty.  \r<br />\r<br />She wept with pain recalling back to the day her family&#39;s world had changed... when the Thalmor had invaded her land. Seeing her parent&#39;s surrounded by the enemy, Arabella feared for their lives.   She couldn&#39;t breathe as she ran to them from a distance.  The general commanding the other Thalmor soldiers, called for his master mages.  Arabella noticed her father try to push his wife away from the assault of magic flying at them, Amaltheia screamed his name as she fell backward; but it was too late.  Arabella&#39;s parents fell motionless to the ground. \r<br />\r<br />Arabella screamed her parent&#39;s name, incidentally gaining the attention of her enemies.  As they approached her, Arabella began to pool fire into the palms of her hands.  Her body twisting naturally to pull all her magic energy into her growing flame. Her rage made her ever the more powerful; fueling her wrath. She cast her magic on the surrounding enemies making many flee or fall in agony.  She began to laugh as the enemy backed away hesitantly.  The mages who attacked her parents walked through the sudden divide between soldiers; they spoke in unison, their magic overwhelming her own. \r<br />\r<br />&#34;Ten mages against a half elf... you don&#39;t stand a chance Lady Arabella.&#34; the general&#39;s conceited tone spoke from the crowd of soldiers.  &#34;Give in now, while you&#39;re still undamaged.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />&#34;No&#33; &#34; Arabella forced the denial feeling the bead of sweat trickle down her temples.  She had to survive.  She had to win, it was her responsibility now to save her beloved parents.  She had to get to them.  She had to save them.  \r<br />\r<br />&#34;Your strength is admirable, but you won&#39;t win this fight.&#34; He said arrogantly. All the mages continued their spells and incantations, their words heavy on Arabella&#39;s resolve making her legs shake.  &#34;Stubborn woman.&#34; He snarled when she didn&#39;t listen. The general roared at the mages to finish it, his impatience evident.  Their magic stabbed at her skin like tiny dagger pricks over and over, relentless. Trying to shake it off Arabella continued to persevere for her family, ignoring the blood that started to drip from her nose and eye corners.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Do your worst.&#34;  Arabella spoke passionately.  The master mages stepped towards her, their unison voices whispering black deeds; infiltrating her mind like a slithering poison. Before Arabella could blink, a powerful force to the back of the head made her collapse cold. The general had managed to get around Arabella when she was focused on the mages, hitting her in the back of the skull with his hilt.  \r<br />\r<br />Now trapped in her cell Arabella feared for her parents- wherever those bastards put them. All in good time, and when their defenses were low, she would strike. She couldn&#39;t wait for Abrianna to arrive, and without her parents close by to know if they planned something- she had to do this alone. The Thalmor underestimate her and her family. If only they knew... Let them underestimate; all the better to take that weak thinking and kill them with it- Arabella thought. They might have her in a gloomy dungeon for now- but it won&#39;t hold her. Already the energies of the Earth fueled her.  The moss, roots, and even dirt gave her body more and more energy to get her magicka stronger, and before long her flames would engulf them all.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Its only a matter of time...
