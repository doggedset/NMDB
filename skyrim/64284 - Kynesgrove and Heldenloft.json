  "summary": "ClefJ&#39;s modification of Kynesgrove with a unique player home&#33; ",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][u][font=Georgia][size=6]Kynesgrove & Heldenloft[/size][/font][/u]\r<br />\r<br />This is primarily a player home mod - Heldenloft, a cozy cabin adjoined to a Nordic ruin tower that doubles as Kynesgrove&#39;s windmill. \r<br />It contains a modest space and numerous accomodations for the Dragonborn after they slay the Dragon at Kynesgrove, including:\r<br />- 5 weapon racks with 1 sword/shield plaque\r<br />- 2 mannequins\r<br />- Alchemy and Enchantment tables w/ an anvil on the porch\r<br />- Otherwise, the building is primarily aesthetic with no DLC attachments. \r<br />\r<br />Kynesgrove itself is lightly modified, including a new tradehouse and blacksmith, with 2 new vendors&#33; The outside terrain now has light fortifications against the dangers of Eastmarch and the civil war, but nothing claustrophobic.\r<br />\r<br />After [i]A Blade in the Dark[/i], there was really no reason to go back to Kynesgrove, a quest-related town. I felt so, anyways. With a home and other amenities, I&#39;m hoping people might return to this forgotten little hamlet. \r<br />\r<br />[youtube]XRai1L_JUhY[/youtube]\r<br />[b]\r<br />[u][youtube]8Nz_y-Kg8fk[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Incompatabilities: [/u][/b]\r<br />Nernies Village and Town Expansion, along with other mods that modify Kynesgrove, I imagine won&#39;t work so well with this unfortunately. There is a dungeon work in progess in the Steamscorch Mine, but it isn&#39;t connected atm and should be revisited later. \r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s a very small and hopefully lovely mod for everyone to enjoy for Easter&#33; If you think more should be done for the town, or if I should separate Heldenloft as an independent home without town modification, let me know.[/center]",
