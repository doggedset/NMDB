If you have a mod that alters armor spells or how the AI handles them in any way, you might experience issues. \r\n\r\n- The mod uses vanilla conditions and effects. Only the tutor xp gain and summon spells have custom scripts. If you find spells looking weird or hitting the wrong thing, it\\'s likely due to another mod affecting keywords or spell FX in an odd way.\r\n\r\n[b][center][color=darkred][size=+2]Known Issues[/size][/color][/center][/b]\r\n\r\n- Using any mod that allows you to give followers new spells may override priority of their heals/buffs, so choose wisely. ASIS seems to give out new spells/perks automatically, which could essentially neutralize the custom abilities in this mod.\r\n\r\n- Bard followers get distracted by corpses and stop playing their lutes, but keep singing. A quick fix would be to not make them play while surrounded by corpses D:\r\n\r\n- Bard followers have to be dismissed to take requests properly. \r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]When updating, be sure to take back custom gear and dismiss them first if the changelog says they have new locations! Not doing this can lead to broken follower scripts.[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n[u]Changelog[/u]:\r\n\r\n2.0\r\n\r\nAdded Eric Taragan. He\\'s a healer for undead players and their undead allies. Also summons a leveled undead warrior.\r\n\r\nCleaned esp quite a bit. \r\n\r\nFleshed out Alvara, Ra\\'Jiri, Sillen, Nirrah and Mereth. Increased knockdowns on Dharga. \r\n\r\n1.9.1\r\n\r\nIncluded missing script files.\r\n\r\n1.9\r\n\r\nAdded Tutor type followers that grant the player a little xp by using the respective skill. \r\nSo far, these include:\r\nDestruction\r\nRestoration\r\nConjuration\r\nMarksman\r\nOne/Two Handed\r\nBlock\r\n\r\n1.8.1\r\n\r\nThanks to JanusForbeare, all of the followers now carry tomes that teach you to summon them.\r\nNo more lost followers! Take them anywhere!\r\n\r\n1.8 \r\n\r\nAdded Ganius, Volki and Florence.\r\nGanius is a functioning healer, while Volki/Florence are functioning bards.\r\n\r\nGave Klaira the ability to summon Snowflake, a small frost atronach that levels with you. She can also buff your frost resist slightly.\r\n\r\n1.7\r\n\r\nAdded Mereth and Ra\\'jiri to the drunken huntsman. \r\n\r\nAdded Sillen Harborough to the Bannered Mare. \r\n\r\n1.6.1\r\n\r\nExtended the range on Odvar and Alvara\\'s buffs.

All though... if you\\'ve found this mod and not those, you should sort by most endorsements first I think :P\r\n\r\n",
