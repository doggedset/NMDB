I personally liked the location, and set it upon myself to rebuild the house and make it inhabitable again. \r<br />\r<br />The house is simple, with a small bookshelf, a weapon plaque, a mannequin, and a wood chopping block. There are also two corundum ore veins nearby. I&#39;ll admit my main motivation for building this was trying out a hidden door, which can be seen in the pictures; this leads to a basement with all smithing amenities, as well as enchanting and alchemy tables. \r<br />\r<br />As far as I could see, there are no bounties or quests regarding this location, but just in case, I moved the bandits and their locked chest not too far away, and left the copy of the Pickpocket skill book Beggar on top of the crates near the door. \r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Notes[/b][/u]\r<br />I originally made this mod for the Steam Workshop.
