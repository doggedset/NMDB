  "summary": "The Blade of Woe was improved to absorb 10 points of magic, health, and stamina, instead of just 10 points of health. I also included a classy retex of the blade done by boxhead52347 to give it a more unique feel.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The Blade of Woe was not nearly as unique as it could have been. So I made this mod to improve the enchantments on it as well as include a nice optional retexture of the blade done by another modder. I did NOT in any way make the retexure and all of the credit goes to boxhead52347. I just felt that this retexure was a solid addition to the blade.",
