  "descriptionHtml": "[center][IMG]http://i57.tinypic.com/x8w8h.png[/IMG][/center]\r<br />These are a series of upcoming tutorials on how to modify your skyrim manually, bit by bit. Some are so easy and done everyday by more experienced people, which leads to no one wondering what the newcomers are up to, or if they know what they&#39;re doing.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to that, i planned a go-to, well-presented group of tutorials for the most basic items, such as manually making replacements for the game files, as well as directly modifying things in nifskope and CK/TES5Edit and even the very basics of mod instalation.\r<br />\r<br />Just because you think you know how to do it, doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t read these. You may learn a thing or two, or even correct me - this is something that needs to be developed over time.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />J&#39;raidar is one of LEON&#39;s first and most loved characters in Skyrim. She was a khajiit, did many great things, but never managed to get to saving the land from the World Eater. Now she&#39;s in retirement, helping us present the tutorials. :)\r<br />\r<br />Upcoming guides (in no particular order) :\r<br />Mod instalation\r<br />Replacers\r<br />TES5Edit / CK usage\r<br />[maybe, simplified] Texture editing/creation\r<br />[maybe, simplified] Model editing/creation",
