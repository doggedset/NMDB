They live in small tribes of hunters and gatherers. \r<br />Despite their tall stature, they are extremely agile, have a faster regeneration to wounds and very sharp senses. They are skilled with a bow and blade but have difficulty in learning magic, although it is not unheard of specimen that mastered the arcane arts.\r<br />\r<br />[b]---Name---[/b]\r<br />The name is loosely based on the latin &#34;longus auris&#34;, long-eared.\r<br />\r<br />[b]---Traits---[/b]\r<br />-Faster running speed\r<br />-Increased health regeneration\r<br />-Low starting health\r<br />-Slightly decreased magicka regeneration\r<br />-Lesser power that detects living/dead, tagging them for 1-2 seconds\r<br />-Tall\r<br />\r<br />Mainly suited for stealth/rogue characters, giving increased mobility and health regeneration perfect for evasion and hit and run tactics at the expense of base health\r<br />\r<br />[b]---Notes---[/b]\r<br />The head uses the Khajiit&#39;s helmet models, as such, there might be some clipping. Generally it shouln&#39;t be an issue however, as the shape is very similar\r<br />\r<br />Females have facial hair because, well, it&#39;s hard not to when your face is already covered in \r<br />hair. Makes no sense not to have the option to make your character&#39;s face extra fuzzy&#33; Males get to keep the mustaches though.\r<br />\r<br />A few lungaris set up camp near the guardian stones, just across the river. They don&#39;t do much right now. \r<br />\r<br />[b]---Known Issues---[/b]\r<br />-Odd lighting on ears, particularly females (especially in low light situations but for the most part is bearable, will fix)\r<br />-Clipping when actors use facial expressions (this should be a non-issue on player characters for the most part, regardless, will fix)\r<br />-Missing No Hair option\r<br />-?\r<br />\r<br />[b]---Future (possible) Additions---[/b]\r<br />-Earrings\r<br />-Presets\r<br />-Concentration-type spell version of the Sharp Senses power\r<br />-Making the hair and facial hair less &#34;floaty&#34;\r<br />-New body texture\r<br />-Increasing jump height\r<br />-Stat balancing\r<br />-More NPCs scattered around the world\r<br />-Followers\r<br />-Quests?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]---Compatibility---[/b]\r<br />As you can imagine this mod uses quite a few khajiit assets, so anything that overwrites some \r<br />of the khajiit features (mainly body, eyes and hair) might have an impact. Chances are it will \r<br />just change some things around without breaking anything, but you never know\r<br />\r<br />[b]---FAQ---[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Q: Is this based on the game Lugaru?\r<br />A: No, while it was an inspiration, the similarities in the name are a coincidence.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Are you going to add large rabbit-like buck teeth?\r<br />A: They already do have them&#33; Real rabbits do not usually have visible teeth when they have their mouth shut, unlike you might see in cartoons and the like.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Are you going to add a tail?\r<br />A: No, for technical reasons aswell as personal preference.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Will you make a version without floppy ears?\r<br />A: See above.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Can you make their ears move when they change mood?\r<br />A: They already do, to a degree. Their facial expression files are that of the Khajiits so I currently have no control over them, and I don&#39;t plan to change for the time being.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Will you add increased jump height?\r<br />A: Can&#39;t be done without SKSE, and I won&#39;t make it a requirement just for that.\r<br />\r<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />You like rabbits?
