  "descriptionHtml": "A simple mod to let you choose between various different styles of magic effects for your favorite spells. I made this mod simply because I thought the purplish nature of shock magic made me think too much about conjuration. I wanted something a bit more blue/white looking. So I made it, and while I was it I figured out how to do it to all the spells in the game. Therefor, instead of just making ALL spells willy-nilly, I&#39;ll be taking requests for a period of time. Purple lightning wasn&#39;t exactly the best fit for my hero, and lightning can actually come in many different colors. It&#39;s entirely realistic and &#34;lore-friendly&#34; depending on how much information exists in TES about lightning. For those of you who don&#39;t know, the color of the lightning we see depends entirely on the air the electricity is heating up and not the lightning itself.",
