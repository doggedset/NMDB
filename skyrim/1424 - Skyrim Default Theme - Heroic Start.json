  "descriptionHtml": "Tired of sitting at the main screen waiting for Skyrim\\'s amazing theme to really get going?  Well, fret no more!  This mod simply rearranges the default theme music to start off at a point I consider to be much more epic.  Start your gaming session right as the sons and daughters of Skyrim chant you on to glory!\r\n\r\nI made this for myself initially, but figured others might like it, so here you go.  The song should loop as usual, so once it gets to the end it will go back to the real start of the song (which you would hear without this mod).\r\n\r\nHere\\'s a preview of what you can expect when you start up your game:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or3kZgrg9_4\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nSimply extract the .rar file to your Steam/Steamapps/Common/Skyrim/Data folder.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.  :)\r\n\r\nCredits:  All credit for the actual music goes to Bethesda and Jeremy Soule, I simply rearranged it a bit.\r\n\r\nNow also on Steam Workshop:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=9664",
