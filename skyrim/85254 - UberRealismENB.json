  "descriptionHtml": "[center][/center][left][/left][size=6]This is only [/size][color=#ffff00][size=4][u][i][b]two files[/b][/i][/u][/size][/color][size=6] in size. How you might ask? It only includes the [/size][size=4][u][b][i][color=#ffff00]ENBseries.ini[/color][/i][/b][/u] [/size][size=6]file which contains all the adjustments and the [/size][color=#ffff00][size=4][u][i][b]ENBpalette.BMP[/b][/i][/u][/size][/color][size=6] this is used to Shade the world and everything.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=6]So Steps to install this...[/size]\r<br />[size=4]      1. Go out and find an ENBpreset and install it.\r<br />      2. Download these two flies from URE.\r<br />      3. Go to the Steam/steamapp/common/skyrim folder...\r<br />      4. Replace the file ENBseries.ini from the other ENB with the ENBseries.ini that was just downloaded from URE.\r<br />      5. Now Open the ENBseries Folder and replace the ENBPalette.BMP with the one from URE.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />So many of you are probably like well that is just lazy as F*** piggy backing off someone else&#39;s ENB. YES and NO. these are the only two files that i actually made and im actually reusing my ENBpalette from the last ENB i made cuz it&#39;s a better shade mapping image. the actually ENBseries.INI file is high quality and versatile. \r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=6]The point i&#39;m trying to make is maybe that ULTRA realistic ENB that many of us want isn&#39;t something we can do alone, this will be a collaborative piece of art. \r<br />\r<br />Mixing and matching different ENB presets this HERESY&#33;&#33;&#33; YUP, but isn&#39;t the point to make the game look and feel better?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Alright so what do these two files do when combined with other enbs?\r<br />[/font]well why don&#39;t you come find out.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />***ANYONE WHO WANTS TO IMPROVE THIS ENB AND TAKE THIS FURTHER YOU HAVE THAT PERMISSION\r<br />LETS MAKE CUSTOM WEATHERS BASED ON CITY, SETTLEMENT, HOLD, KINGDOM, AND REGION.\r<br />LETS MAKE FX BETTER AND MORE DYNAMIC\r<br />MAKE THE COLOR MORE PALE, MORE CONTRAST, MORE DYNAMIC AS YOU TRAVEL. LET THE COLOR CHANGE WITH THE SKY COVERAGE, OR THE SUNSET, OR SUNRISE.\r<br />YOUR CHARATCTER SHOULD BE THE BEST LOOKING CHARACTER IN THE BEST LOOKING LIGHT\r<br />IT IS TIME TO MAKE REFLECTIONS SO REAL THAT WE CAN FINALLY SEE OUR CHARACTER IN THE WATER.***  [/size]",
