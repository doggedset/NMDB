[/color][/size]\r<br />[size=4] This is meant for players like me who have obtained the best items of vanilla Skyrim and want better weapons/armor.\r<br /> It is an end-game weapon, and does higher damage than any Daedric. The guards in the screenshots were made immortal to help me showcase the weapon. You can purchase it at the Warmaiden&#39;s in Whiterun. I did not have any greatsword positioning mods at the time I took screenshots, so I had my cape and backpack unequipped.[/size][size=1]yes I look nooby :)[/size][size=4]\r<br />[color=orange] Flamehazer does high fire damage, and doesn&#39;t wear out. The mesh is from the &#34;Riesig Greatsword&#34; in KURESE&#39;s Monster Hunter Series Weapons, but now it&#39;s a completely new weapon with a new molten enchantment.  [/color]\r<br /> [color=orange] Please give constructive criticism. I will listen to any user suggestions and make modifications appropriately. This is my first uploaded mod. [/color]\r<br /> [size=5]I am going to add a real flaming effect to it. I just have to find the right one.[/size]\r<br />[size=4] I am considering adding a formula for it. Probably the Big Rusty Ore and a boatload of Fire Salts, and two black soulgems. [/size]\r<br />Give credit where it is due if you implement or modify my mod and distribute it :) \r<br />Should credit KURESE for the mesh.\r<br />[color=orange] If you want me to retexture one of your meshes then just ask :D -&gt; I can do retextures of all kinds&#33;[/color][/size][size=1]Although I&#39;m not famous D:[/size]\r<br />[size=4]My Mods:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19865]Starbomb Spells and Arrow&#33;[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19776]Deadly Telekinesis[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19769]Flamehazer the Molten Greatsword[/url][/size]",
