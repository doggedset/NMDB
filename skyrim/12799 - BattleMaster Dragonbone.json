I gave the armor more of a battle worn look, like from getting blasted by fire and ice with a slight polish and some metal reinforcement lining the bones.\r\n\r\nI plan on retexturing the rest of the dragon armor line like scale and female versions, this was a personal project.. but hey I figured I\\'d upload it here .. I enjoy it .. probably someone out there might enjoy it aswell.\r\n\r\nRetextured Items: helm,body,gloves,boots and shield\r\n\r\nInstallation: \r\nData>textures>armor>dragonbone  \r\nor \r\njust use Nexus Mod Manager",
