  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][b]IMMERSIVE IDIOTS: RODERICK REDBEARD [/b][size=3]by Someguy[/size][b]\r<br />\r<br />DESCRIPTION[/b]:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Some mods fit neatly into predesignated categories, while others shatter the fetters of convention and taste through the sheer might of IMMERSION. [i]Roderick Redbeard[/i] is such a mod. In the course of this plugin, you&#39;ll undertake a collection of pointless and unconnected quests that set you down the righteous path of IMMERSION. Additionally, you&#39;ll gain an IMMERSIVE companion who muses endlessly on the finer points of procreation, infanticide, and alcoholism.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Roderick Redbeard[/i] represents the initial installment in what will hopefully become a series of IMMERSIVE companions. What type of companions? The sort that reinforce base urges, complement your vices, and imbue a false sense of moral and intellectual superiority by way of their own depravity and ignorance.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]OBLIGATORY VISUAL ASSURANCE[/b]:[/size]\r<br />Shortly after the mod&#39;s release, some players expressed concern about the dearth of visual evidence for the mod&#39;s quality. After due consideration, I will now release a private design document which should stifle any doubts. \r<br />\r<br />Here is the plot diagram:\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/IFcjf4a.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />I rest my case.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]INSTALLATION[/b]:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Install the mod with NMM or place the contents of archived &#39;data&#39; folder in the corresponding folder in your [i]Skyrim[/i] directory.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]GETTING STARTED[/b]:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Once you&#39;ve completed the riveting and unforgettable questline for the Companions, seek out a red-haired drunk stumbling about in Jorrvaskr. Rapidly click through his bumbling bombast and you&#39;ll soon be tasked with killing various entities throughout Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]FEEDBACK[/b]:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />I heartily welcome cogent, constructive criticism, but be warned - the polite, tolerant modder of c. 2010 has given way to the jaded, snark-spewing drunk of the present. I now follow the &#34;Ass&#34; rule - if you show your ass in the comments, I block and ban your ass. I&#39;m a petty tyrant, and the comments are my banana republic, so act accordingly.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]A WARNING:[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />I won&#39;t be so bold as to call this mod &#34;Lore-Friendly&#34;, but I will deem it &#34;Lore-Plausible&#34;. Through Herculean willpower, I managed to write and voice the 400+ lines of dialogue without a single utterance of the word &#34;Fuck&#34;. It is possible that other, potentially anachronistic terms slipped in, as I was not as scrupulous in reviewing the content this time. \r<br />\r<br />I produced this plugin over a few weekends as a means to refresh my long-atrophied grasp of Papyrus in anticipation of [i]Fallout 4[/i], which I expect sometime after the Rapture, Ragnarok, and Cthulhu&#39;s glorious return. If casual quips about infanticide and erotic asphyxiation (NOT AT THE SAME TIME&#33;) are offensive, you should probably avoid this mod.\r<br />[size=4]\r<br />[b]DIFFICULTY[/b]:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Almost all my plugins are oriented towards high-level characters, and [i]Roderick Redbeard[/i] is no exception. You will square off against a number of powerful, perk-ridden personalities designed to pummel you into paste. I recommend that you wait until level thirty before initiating the first questline.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]STATISTICS:[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Two Quests: &#34;Unnatural Selection&#34; and &#34;Jorund&#39;s Prize&#34;\r<br />450+ lines of fully-voiced, lip-synced dialogue\r<br />One fully-functional companion\r<br />Two new dungeons (both radiant-compatible)\r<br />Offers roughly one hour of new content\r<br />[size=4]\r<br />[b]OTHER, LESS IMMERSIVE MODS:[/b][/size]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22722/?][i]Sword of Sigdan[/i][/url]\r<br />[size=4]\r<br />[b]CREDITS[/b]:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />The word IMMERSIVE, for inspiring me\r<br />Bethesda, for releasing [i]Skyrim[/i] and the Creation Kit\r<br />The community, for undying support in spite of my changeable, irascible nature\r<br />The goddess who poses as my wife, for ceaseless support and the sharing of beer\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]Permissions:[/b][/size]\r<br />Do not copy or redistribute this mod without my explicit permission.
