  "descriptionHtml": "SUMMON THIS: Bad to the Bone\r\nBy:\r\nZYRIS\r\nJuly 26, 2013\r\n====================\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\nWindows 7 path:\r\nMy computer / Local Disk (c:) / Program Files / Steam / Steamapps / Common / Skyrim / Data\r\n====================\r\nThis is an Undead Dragon companion mod (slightly over powered).\r\n====================\r\nNot long ago I released a mod for the “Creature Companions” called “Summon This: Redux”. \r\nThis is an “accidental” version of that. While testing out a few adjustments I made I decided \r\nto go ahead and release it. This dragon may be considered way over powered for some, and that’s \r\nwhy I’m posting it here.\r\n \r\nHow this mod works: It’s simple, really. Just drop the .esp into your DATA folder and go look \r\nfor a fight. You\\'ll know when he shows up, trust me. \r\nHe detects combat from way atop of the Throat of the World. The highest point is where he lives. You don’t have to summon him or need any special equipment.\r\n\r\nHealth Offset: +500\r\nSpeed: 125 (default is 80)\r\n\r\nSpells / Abilities:\r\na) AbDragonFire\r\nb) AlduinFirestormShout\r\nc) crChaurusPoisonBite02\r\nd) crDragonUnarmedDamage05\r\ne) DragonFireBallShout05\r\nf) DragonFireBreathShout05\r\ng) DragonUnrelentingForceShout\r\nh) crDragonTail\r\n\r\nPerks:\r\na) crDragonResistNPCs\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\nI do not recommend you use this mod with my earlier versions. It is the same dragon and has the \r\nsame home. There may be conflicts.",
