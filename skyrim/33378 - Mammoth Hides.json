  "summary": "Adds Mammoth hides, which can be crafted into leather same as a deer hide.",
  "descriptionHtml": "\\\"One thing I\\'ve learned from Skyrim is that Mammoths do not have pelts. Which is nonsense, because they clearly do- So why don\\'t they?\\\"\r\n\r\nOk, this is only my second mod, far less ambitious and far less challenging, and sadly i\\'m not yet capable of creating a unique mesh for it.\r\n\r\nThis mod does one thing- adds mammoth hides. you take down one of those beast while hunting deer on the plains of whiterun, and think you can run back and make armour from it\\'s skin? well, now you can. Mammoths should drop one skin, which because of it\\'s greater size, has greater value, weight and can be crafter into more leather than, say, a Wolf skin.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s nothing groundbreaking, and I was surprised when I first noticed it wasn\\'t  in the original game, and only now did it occur to me to make a mod for it.\r\nHope you find it useful!",
