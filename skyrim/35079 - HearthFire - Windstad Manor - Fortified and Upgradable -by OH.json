  "descriptionHtml": "Quick Update (3/24/2014) .. So, have some fantastic news.  With some help, I was able to recover my last in progress version of this mod which contained some significant improvements&#33;  The next update Will not only be available sooner, but will be a significant revision on the current version (v2.0).\r<br />\r<br />Cant wait to share it with you all&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Quick Update (3/20/2014) .. I am alive&#33;  after a very long break I&#39;m back at it.  I&#39;m spending the next couple weeks to review everyone&#39;s comments (here and on Steam), logging all the bugs, and getting a new update out to the community.  Lots of features planned&#33;  Stay tuned&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=10][b][u]Overview:[/u][/b][/size][/color]\r<br />Ever wished that the Hearth Fire DLC did just a little bit more? I wanted my home to be a castle so I decided to make one&#33; This mod integrates into the Hearth Fire mod and extends it. Once you have house steward available in your home, you will be able to speak with him/her to &#34;improve the grounds&#34; by adding an outer wall, inner fortress, well, farm house, gates, beacon, stockade and other features. The new book on the drafting table will describe all the various features and keep you up to date of the changes.\r<br />\r<br />Hope you all enjoy and I&#39;ll update when I can. \r<br />\r<br />Feedback is always appreciated and please let me know if you find any bugs (here or on steam). This is my first crack with the creation kit so please be kind. Suggestions for things to add will always be welcome as well&#33; \r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=10][b][u]Installation:[/u][/b][/size][/color]\r<br />Download the latest zip.  expand the zip into your ...skyrimData directory (overwrite if requested). For best results make sure this mod runs last.  \r<br />\r<br />Notes: Requires the Hearth Fire mod. Should be safe with most every mod unless they change the landscape and/or features in the immediate area around Windstad Manor.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Alternate:[/color] Subscribe from Steam at: [url=Steam]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=139555653[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=10][b][u]Uninstall:[/u][/b][/size][/color]\r<br />Why would you ever want to? ;)\r<br />\r<br />Just disable the mod at startup.  If you remove the mod your save games should work just fine but all the features this mod comes with will be gone, and any improvements to the Grounds will be gone.  If you make a new save game then decide later to re-install the mod, then you will need tore-purchase all the upgrades again.\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=10][b][u]Current Features:[/u][/b][/size][/color]\r<br />[list][*]Ground Guide book (located on the drafting table) outlining the buying guide.\r<br />[*]Complete integration with your current House Steward buying menus (under &#34;Make improvements to the grounds&#34; speech option), with voice support \r<br />[*]Can now recruit the following:\r<br />-Castle Guards\r<br />-Stockade Guards\r<br />-High Gate Tower Guards\r<br />-Bridge to Solitude Outpost Guards\r<br />[*]Can now buy the following: \r<br />-Outer Walls \r<br />-Well \r<br />-Portcullis \r<br />-Stockade \r<br />-Farm House \r<br />-Flags\r<br />-Castle Roads\r<br />-Inner Fortress (with drawbridge)\r<br />-Beacon\r<br />-Builders Shed\r<br />-Bridge to Solitude (with double drawbridge)\r<br />-Bridge Beacons\r<br />-Smithy Shack\r<br />-High Gate Guards Tower\r<br />-Bridge to Solitude Outpost\r<br />-Bridge to Solitude Monument\r<br />-Castle Barracks\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=10][b][u]Future Items/WIP:[/u][/b][/size][/color]\r<br />[list][*](NPC) &#34;Smithy&#34; (where you will be able to buy upgrades to your castle guards \r<br />[*](NPC) &#34;Quartermaster&#34; (recruit castle guards option will be moved here)\r<br />[*](NPC) &#34;House Cook&#34;\r<br />[*](NPC) &#34;Ferry Man&#34; (which can take you to the most logical towns and settlements)\r<br />[*](NPC) Castle &#34;Enchanter&#34; (to enable a Portal function)\r<br />[*](NPC) Castle &#34;Guardian Dragon&#34;\r<br />[*]Farm House support (where you will be able to recruit various NPC as townsfolk and vendors to fill out your Castle and have a functional granary). \r<br />[*]Improved walkways on the walls to be able to walk the full way around (including guard patrols) \r<br />[*]Castle Docks\r<br />[*]Larger/Improved Stockades.\r<br />[*]Sub-Basement (with Escape Route)\r<br />[*]Weapon Racks and Practice Dummy (Stockade and Inner Fortress)\r<br />[*]Inner Fortress Sanctum\r<br />[*]Prison\r<br />[*]Family &#34;Run for your Lives&#34; to the Inner Sanctum\r<br />[*]Random Thieves\r<br />[*]Triggerable/Random raids/sieges (possible with catapult support)\r<br />[*]Option to change race of the Castle NPCs\r<br />[*]Castle Guards to be friendlier and option to have as follower\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=10][b][u]CHANGE LOG:[/u][/b][/size][/color]\r<br />[color=yellow][u](Update 04/26/2013)[/u][/color] -- (v2.0) uploaded to Nexus and Steam&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Added Bridge to Solitude Monument and Outpost, High Gate Guards Tower, Smithy shed (with forge), Castle Barracks and Guards&#33; (Castle, Stockade, High Gate Tower, Bridge Outpost)\r<br />------------------- \r<br />[color=yellow][u](Update 04/24/2013)[/u][/color] -- (v1.3) uploaded to Nexus and Steam&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Added a Bridge to Solitude&#33;  Also added Bridge Beacons and updated the Grounds Keeping book with info on new features.\r<br />------------------- \r<br />[color=yellow][u](Update 04/23/2013)[/u][/color] -- (v1.2) uploaded to Nexus and Steam&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Added castle roads, inner fortress (with functional drawbridge), beacon and builders shed (all buyable from the steward). Moved farm outside the walls (placeholder still). Renamed portcullis pull chains.\r<br />-------------------\r<br />[color=yellow][u](Update 04/21/2013)[/u][/color] -- (v1.1) Uploaded to Nexus&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Manor features are now buyable from the house steward, complete with dependency buying structure. When you speak to him/her after installing the mod, you will have an option to &#34;Make improvements to the grounds&#34;. All current (and future) features are will accessible from there. Fully integrated into the out-of-the box hearth fire DLC, you should not even notice it didn&#39;t come like that&#33; Full speech support with the house stewards natural voice and complete with a buying structure for the mods (you need to build the walls before you can add a portcullis gate for example).. tried to make it as much of a natural extension to the Bethesda DLC as possible given my limited experience. \r<br />\r<br />There is a convenient book I wrote which can be found on the drafting table outside. It will explain all the various features currently implemented and hints at what is upcoming. I&#39;ll outline what has been added in this release: \r<br />-Ground Guide book (located on the drafting table) outlining the buying guide. \r<br />-Complete integration with your current House Steward, with voice support.\r<br />-Several buyable features.\r<br />-Corrected a glitch in the local dungeons where a work in progress crossed over and prevented you from getting into the tombs. \r<br />-------------------\r<br />[color=yellow][u](Update 04/20/2013)[/u][/color] -- Stables have been remade, will plug into the out of the box Hearthfire DLC. Also added no-respawn barrel, sack and chest for misc. storage and water troughs for the horses.\r<br />-------------------\r<br />[color=yellow][u](Update 04/19/2013)[/u][/color] -- v1.0 available.  Contains original version of the outer walls which will be static only (install the mod and they will be available regardless, if you want the dynamic upgradable option, use the latest version).",
