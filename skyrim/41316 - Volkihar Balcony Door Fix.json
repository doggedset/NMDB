  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple mod that fixes the door of Volkihar Balcony.\r\nIt is locked with a Novice Lock now, and does not require a key unlock or for you to finish the quest.\r\nAnd best of all it lets you go back inside.\r\nThis does not fix any bugs with the \\\"Chasing Echoes\\\" Quest.\r\n\r\n\\\"Chasing Echoes\\\" Quest, Command Fixes\r\n\r\nIf Serana just walks around saying \\\"we are getting close I am sure of it\\\", and you are in Valerica\\'s laboratory use:\r\nsetstage DLC1VQ04 35\r\n\r\nIf you are in Valerica\\'s laboratory and she is not asking you to get \\\"Valerica\\'s Journal\\\" use:\r\nsetstage DLC1VQ04 50\r\n\r\nThese may not be the same commands that you need to fix the quest but they were what i needed.\r\nHope this helps.",
