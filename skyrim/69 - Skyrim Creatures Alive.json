I changed formid for nearly all variants, leveledlist have been redesigned, alot of new features for Version 0.25==Once Again Requires Respawn to Take Effect=====\r\n\r\nWelcome to Skyrim Creature Alive this mod is a Creatures Overhaul focusing on Creatures, creature ai, creature factions, new variants at this Time. Creature Leveledlist Redesign has well with a Unleveled Encounter Anything at lvl 1 approach with Vanilla Feel that is balanced yet Random.\r\nThis is a start of what will be Very Large Mod Project Similiar to Oblivion Mart\\'s Monster Mod that I manage and maintain.\r\n\r\nSection 1: Leveledlist Spawn System\r\nSection 2: Faction Changes\r\nSection 3: Vanilla Creatures and Monster Variant List\r\n\r\n[color=#B22222][b]=============================================\r\nSection 1: Leveled Creatures List Changes\r\n=============================================[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nOnly Creature Leveledlist are changed. Did not touch Npc or Dragon or Skeleton or Draugh List. So you may use PISE for it Npc Changes Etc.\r\nAll Creatures or Monsters have chance to Spawn at Level 1, regardless of player levels. each vanilla type has a Variant that is weaker or stronger and a chance of spawning so beware.\r\n\r\nI have designed the unleveled system very carefully using custom leveledlist for everything. And also ensured that list still followed lowest to highest level creatures. With skeever and wolves being listed 3 times, bear and sabrecat listed 2 times, monster\\'s listed 1. This is very balanced because it still has a Vanilla Feel to it. But at the same time, is unleveled and random.\r\n\r\nAlso all creature are more regional based. For example in Vanilla almost all the Snow Creatures can be found in Snowy Areas only this make sense. But in some list NOrmal Wolves would spawn instead of Snow Wolves. In other Region list like the Plains or Marsh The Wolves could have been spread out to be more regional or only certain types of Bears. So you will not Artic Animals in Warm AReas, and Vice Versa. No plains or marsh animals in Snowy Areas.\r\n\r\nThis will make the game more challenging has many creatures that did not spawn until higher levels. Will now spawn at lvl 1 (ice wolf) or eariler then they should (Cave Bear / Snow Bear), Trolls, Giants. And this really does not unbalance things too much. Has some of these creatures can be found in world even at lvl 1 has some are placed in world itself.\r\n\r\n[color=#B22222][b]=============================================\r\nsection 2: Creature Faction Changes\r\n=============================================[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nI have changed many of creature faction to be friends, neutral or enemy with each other. In and effort for creature to fight with each other More. So that player is no longer center of attention per say.\r\n\r\nBears - Friend with Spriggan, Neutral toward Skeevers, Enemies - Spider, Wolf, Chaurus, Troll, SabreCat\r\nChaurus - Was Friend with Spider they are now enemies, was friends with Skeever now Neutral, Spriggan Friend, Enemy - Bear, Sabrecat, Wolf, Troll\r\nSabreCat - Friend with Spriggan, enemies - Bear, Wolf, Skeever, Spider, Chaurus,\r\nSkeever - Neutral toward Bears and Chaurus, Friends with Spriggan, Enemies - Bears, Sabrecat, Trolls, Wolves,\r\nSpider - Was Friend with Chaurus now Enemies, Friend with Spriggan, Enemies - Bears, Sabrecat, Trolls, Wolves, Neutral with Skeevers\r\nSpriggan - Friend to All Creature Faction expect Troll which are enemies\r\nTroll - hostile toward everything\r\nWolf - Friend of Spriggans, enemies - Bear, Spiders, Chaurus, Skeever, Trolls,\r\nGiant - Added Frost Giant has Enemy\r\nNew Frost Giant Faction - Enemies are Normal Giant and Mammoth\\'s.\r\n\r\nNeeds Feedback please, hopefully it does not break anything\r\n\r\n[color=#B22222][b]=============================================\r\nSection 3: Vanilla Creatures and Monster\r\n=============================================[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[b]===================\r\nWolf Family\r\n===================[/b]\r\n- Names for Wolves have been renamed to Grey Wolves, Red Wolves, Black Wolf, Snow Wolf.\r\n- Normal Wolves - Grey Wolves - I Adjusted or Corrected the WNAM Model to point to ARMO (SkinWolf) and not ARMO (SkinWolfBlack) which is used by Wolf_Indoor/Bandit Wolf aka Black Wolf..\r\n- Ajdusted or Corrected template settings on Red Wolves, Black Wolves, to use own stats, aisettings, etc. Where using default Grey Wolf.
