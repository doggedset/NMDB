We need to talk.” she begins tentatively.\r<br />“Oh?  About what?”\r<br />“You&#39;ve been really good to me since I turned up here looking for a job.”\r<br />“Well?  You&#39;re a good worker.”\r<br />“You&#39;ve been more than just my boss. A friend.” Saadia smiles.\r<br />“Hm.” Hulda just chuckles.\r<br />“I need some time off.”\r<br />“Oh here we go...” Hulda frowns.\r<br />“It&#39;s not what you think.”\r<br />“Saadia?” Hulda attempts to prompt something tangible from the girl.\r<br />“I&#39;m being hunted. By Alik&#39;r warriors.”\r<br />“What?&#33;” Hulda shouts and rushes to grab her sword from behind the bar. “Where are the bastards?&#33;  I&#39;ll gut them myself&#33;”\r<br />“Calm down, Hulda. They only know that I&#39;m in Skyrim, not that I&#39;m working here.  Well, not yet.”\r<br />“What do they want?  What did you do?” Hulda says, now with more concern for the girl than anger at her would be assassins.\r<br />“It&#39;s all wrapped up in Hammerfell politics.  They see me as some kind of traitor but that could be said by either side depending on what you believe.  That&#39;s why I need to head to Riften.”\r<br />“Riften?  The face sculptor?” Hulda realises her intent. “Saadia, that could be dangerous...”\r<br />“And the alternative?” Saadia fiercely poses the question.\r<br />Hulda ponders a moment.\r<br />“Alright.  Go.  Do what you need to.” Hulda holds her arms up, knowing Saadia needs to do this.\r<br />“And Hulda? No-one must know of this, I&#39;m trusting you with my life.”\r<br />“Don&#39;t worry, Saadia.  Your secret is safe with me.”\r<br />\r<br />And so Saadia, under the cover of night headed to Riften and the face sculptor did perform her work but alas, as much as Galathil tried, nothing could be done of the Redguard&#39;s scar as though it was a curse as much as a blemish. Only time will tell if this curse will be her undoing.\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=3]Mod does what?[/size][/color]\r<br />Updates the appearance of the Bannered Mare tavern NPC and bar vendor, Saadia.\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=3]Details:[/size][/color]\r<br />UNP and CBBE versions available - Click &#39;manual download&#39; and select the body type to install.\r<br />This mod does not update any other NPCs or player defaults.\r<br />Standard non-bbp meshes included for compatibility.\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=3]Requirements:[/size][/color]\r<br />Skyrim updated to the latest version.\r<br />\r<br />[color=green][size=3]Installation:[/size][/color]\r<br />Install via NMM.\r<br />Manual installation – install manually.
