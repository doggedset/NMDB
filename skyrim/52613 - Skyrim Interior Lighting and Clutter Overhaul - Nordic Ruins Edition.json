  "descriptionHtml": "==================\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />==================\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim 1.8.151.0\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />Description:\r<br />==================\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim Interior Lighting and Clutter Overhaul removes the excess and unrealistic lighting and clutter from many of Skyrim&#39;s interior locations.  I set out to make this mod after spending years annoyed by the lit torches and honed swords found in supposedly ancient and undisturbed ruins.  Going through each cell in the Creation Kit, I removed individual lights and clutter objects by hand to create a more realistic and immersive experience.  I removed or occasionally added clutter to reflect the situation of the ruins more realistically.  Going into a Draugr infested ruin undisturbed for years?  All lights and organic clutter have been removed.  Bandits living in an old ruins?  Bedrolls have been added if none existed to make the ruins look more lived in.  Currently I have gone through about half of the Nordic Ruins locations.  \r<br />\r<br />I plan to finish the Nordic Ruins by the end of the month, but if this gets a positive response I will try to release faster than that.   I am releasing early to gauge the response and see if it will be worth continuing this project.    \r<br />\r<br />My general approach to removing light sources was to remove them unless an NPC that needs light actively inhabited the cell.  Clutter was done to match the lighting, with a lot of gear being removed unless the game provided a signal that it had been there recently.  I removed about half the potions I came across.  This is help with game balance, while still reflecting that not all potions were sealed properly and went bad after years of sitting in ruins.  Any organic clutter was removed unless a living person lived in the cell to put in there.  Traps were left alone for game balance.  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />Details:\r<br />==================\r<br />\r<br />With the added immersion from this mod, there is added challenge.  You must now provide your own lighting.  For the biggest challenge, you can play vanilla and use torches and light spells to make your way through the depths.  I personally prefer Chesko&#39;s Wearable Lanterns mod, which you can get here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17416/?\r<br />\r<br />This mod also comes with Interior and Dungeon Fog Remover (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/736/?).  I will offer a version without this mod bundled but I highly recommend it.  \r<br />\r<br />For a list of locations that have been overhauled, check out the development spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmDEIsaCTLFgdGFsSEhYUGQtMVJIbmtfa3M0N1N2VEE&usp=drive_web#gid=4  \r<br />I also have notes attempting to explain what I think the backstory for the location is and that in turn influences what clutter I remove.  I am a one man team here, so if I missed something, broke something, or you think I ruined a cell with too much clutter removal or not enough, please don&#39;t hesitate to contact me.  \r<br />\r<br />Performance:\r<br />This mod should not impact your performance at all.  No assets have been added, I have only removed objects from cells and tweaked the imagespaces.  \r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />This mod is compatible with Realistic Lighting Overhaul, as RLO edits imagespaces and the base light objects, but does not affect the actual placed lights.  \r<br />\r<br />You may attempt to use this mod with Enhanced Lights and FX, but there are some conflicts so proceed at your own risk.  \r<br />\r<br />This mod is compatible with Sounds of Skyrim\r<br />==================\r<br />Installation:\r<br />==================\r<br />------------------------------\r<br />Manual Instructions\r<br />------------------------------\r<br />1) Extract the contents of the ZIP folder into your Data folder\r<br />2) Make sure the .esp is checked in the Launcher\r<br />\r<br />------------------------------\r<br />Nexus Mod Manager Instructions\r<br />------------------------------\r<br />Installing the Mod\r<br />\r<br />1) Extract the contents of the archive to a temporary folder.\r<br />2) Copy the extracted archive to [Install Path]SkyrimNMMMods.\r<br />3) Start Nexus Mod Manager\r<br />4) Click the Create button\r<br />5) Click the Add Archive button, navigate to the archive and select it, then click the Yes button.\r<br />6) Click the Create button, wait until it finishes, then click the Ok button.\r<br />\r<br />Activating the Mod\r<br />\r<br />1) Start Nexus Mod Manager\r<br />2) Double-click the name of the mod, once installed the mod icon will turn blue.\r<br />==================\r<br />Un-Installation:\r<br />==================\r<br />------------------------------\r<br />Manual Instructions\r<br />------------------------------\r<br />1) Delete the files/folders associated with the mod\r<br />2) Unheck the .esp in the Launcher\r<br />\r<br />------------------------------\r<br />Nexus Mod Manager Instructions\r<br />------------------------------\r<br />1) Start Nexus Mod Manager\r<br />2) Double click the mod to deactivate it, once finished the icon will turn green\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />Changelog:\r<br />==================\r<br />\r<br />4/1/2014 - Initial Release\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />Contact Details:\r<br />==================\r<br />\r<br />You can contact me on Nexus as sommerjj or on Steam as Son of a Sailor\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />Credits:\r<br />==================\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r<br />Thanks to InsanitySorrow for the ReadMe Generator this ReadMe is based on.\r<br />Thanks to the author of Interior and Dungeon Fog Remover for giving their mod to the public for use\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />Tools Used:\r<br />==================\r<br />ReadMe Generator\r<br />Creation Kit",
