  "descriptionHtml": "This is a possible beginning of removing many annoying things in Skyrim.\r\n\r\nI got so tired of having guards chase me down and ask me to stop shouting so I made this.\r\nThis initial version only removes the guards harassing  you for shouting. (as it should be since... I am DragonBorn and not subject to their petty fears)\r\n\r\nIt is quasi elegant as it eliminates the conditional variable.  If someone has another method of outright removing a script call please post it.  That would be the most elegant method.\r\n\r\nI plan to remove the people complaining about the spells I am using next.  (Get away from me with at fire, this wont end well, get away from me with that magic... etc etc.\r\nI will take requests if you have any.\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\nDrop into your Data folder.  The directory structure is set properly so should be nmm compatible.\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\nremove GuardsNoShoutStop.esp from your data folder",
