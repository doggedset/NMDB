  "descriptionHtml": "A \\\"port\\\" of my Shady Fences mod for Oblivion.\r\n\r\nThe Shady Sam Organization is back, setting up camp at the Holds Stables or just in town.\r\nThey Sell 24-7, buy anything, and sell leveled Weapons and Armor.\r\nTheir network is busy so they have 20k gold each and thus are very powerful, do not attack them.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\nI wanted merchants that I can unload to at all major holds.\r\nI use my Follower & Horse as pack mules & I can haul 645 weight units, that\\'s a lot of gear.\r\nAlso when I want to \\\"clear out\\\" their inventories I can just unload the esp.\r\nVanilla merchants will sometimes hold on to rare or high cost items forever, letters, bountys, notes, and I find that annoying.\r\n\r\nv1: Release, New NPC to all Hold Stables or Towns.\r\nv1.01: Fix Now Shady NPCs will buy and sell ANYTHING including Stolen items. Also gave them actual names, thanks to faeriexdecay\r\nv1.02: Added Wall Lean Markers, moved all chests out of game world.\r\nv1.03: Put names back to more anonymous ones.\r\nv1.04: Added Shady Samantha\\'s to Villages and Settlements.",
