  "summary": "Adds a Draenei race from the popular Warcraft games to Skyrim. Female only at the moment.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65163/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/b7O5gd7.png[/img][/url]\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a modified Draenei race, based off of Carloss32&#39;s race, and using several modder&#39;s resources from a Draenei race created for Oblivion by GSBmodder (I cannot list the site due to Nexus regulations). THIS IS FEMALE ONLY&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I redid the textures, converted some of the meshes from Oblivion to Skyrim, and weighted some of the custom body parts using 3ds Max.\r<br />\r<br />I used the UNP slim body.\r<br />\r<br />I am releasing this mod &#34;as is&#34; for now, because I am finding myself extremely busy with classes lately, and I have gotten several requests to release it. \r<br />\r<br />Please note that because the Draenei body uses extremely custom legs, pretty much ANY armor will not look right on it. Essentially any armor with parts that are added bellow the kneecap will end up floating, sometimes with strange leg parts. In addition, boots either don&#39;t show up, or overwrite the new Draenei hoof-legs and will show normal humanoid legs and feet. One of the only armors I can possibly think of that won&#39;t add leg parts bellow the kneecap is the imperial light armor. There may or may not be others, I may be wrong, and/or you may be able to find mod added armor that work, I really don&#39;t know.\r<br />\r<br />While I was and sort of am working on at least one custom armor for this race, I cannot give any kind of ETA because, like I said, real life intrudes for now, and receives full priority.\r<br />\r<br />I will include an optional Hair Physics Project patch, simply because I made it for my own use along with this race.\r<br />\r<br />*On a side note, I don&#39;t have time to sift through which files are test files (in terms of meshes and textures), and which are the ones that are actually in use. Because of this, I HIGHLY recommend that you don&#39;t mess with the files included in this mod. This includes anything from renaming files, to moving them, to deleting them.\r<br />\r<br />*UPDATE*\r<br />\r<br />Ok... I whipped up a quick CBBE replacer. It may not work (I don&#39;t have the time to test it). Possible issues may include:\r<br />\r<br />-Body colors may be off\r<br />-Tail&#39;s base may not be fully seeded above bottom\r<br />-Horns and facial tentacles may clip on the head wrong\r<br />-Original ears may clip through the new ones (I flattened them on the mesh for the UNP version, I don&#39;t have time to do that for the CBBE version at present)\r<br />\r<br />Feedback needed&#33;",
