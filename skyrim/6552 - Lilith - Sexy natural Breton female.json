  "summary": "Good looking and not exaggerated beauty. Most suited for necromancer RP (hence the name).",
  "descriptionHtml": "I was tired of seeing all those beauty queens running through Skyrim and this is why I tried creating a good looking yet realistic character myself. The outcome of this was Lilith. She is super sexy in my eyes and yet she still fits perfectly in the world of Skyrim. She is best suited to be played as a necromancer or mage kind of gameplay but she looks great in almost every clothing you put on her.\r\n\r\nFeel free to leave a comment!",
