      "changelogHtml": " Increased the overall reflectivity of the armor, while lowering it for the arm bandages and legs.\r<br />\r<br />Created a new reflection cubemap for the armor using spacescape in hopes that I could get a more &#34;forged midnight&#34; look.. don&#39;t think I succeeded but I quite like the shiny shiny now :)\r<br />\r<br />Decreased the specularity for the armor, especially in the bandages and legs.\r<br />\r<br />tried to match the bandages on body armor and gloves a bit better.\r<br />\r<br />Discovered I&#39;m a dummy and I CAN have a reflective hood alongside the glowing eyes since they are seperate meshes :)\r<br />\r<br />Darkened the bow texture some more\r<br />\r<br />Changed both sword and bow objects to use their own reflection cubemap since the new armor one was a bit too detailed and didn&#39;t look that nie on them.\r<br />\r<br />Ditched the NotSoDark version for now since I don&#39;t like the look with the new edits and refmap etc.\r<br />\r<br />Updated Alurict compatability mesh to use it&#39;s own reflection map since I reduced the reflectivity around the eyes of the face mask for the main mod so it would blend in a little better to the dark eyes. I also changed the mesh to use the male version of the refmap instead of female.. woops :)\r<br />\r<br />Added compatability meshes for Lord Haun&#39;s maskless hood so they match up a bit nicer with the rest of my edits.\r<br />\r<br /> <br/> \n",
