  "descriptionHtml": "This is just a simple mod to change the weights of dwarven clutter, like dwarven scrap metal to be more in line with their sizes. It also changes the amount of ingots you get for smelting each piece of clutter to be more in line with the law of the conservation of mass. \r\n\r\nFor instance, bent dwemer scrap metal, weighing 2, now produce a single ingot weighing 1 unit of weight instead of 3 units worth ingots. Likewise, solid dwemer metal has had its weight reduced to 15 and its ingot yield increased to 10. I figured that, due to the fact that these scraps of metal that have been lying around for thousands of years, there should be some decay and impurity, and not all of the weight should be pure metal. All of the dwemer clutter that originally could be melted into ingots has been adjusted, and dwemer scrap metal, dwemer cogs, and dwemer gears can now be melted down as well.",
