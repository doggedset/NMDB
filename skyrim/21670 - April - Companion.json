  "descriptionHtml": "[b]08/06/12 - UPDATE[/b]\r\nI\\'ve finally got around to giving her skills. In which I made her a full fledged baddy with the bow. Although, she would rather not .. I mean, she will fight. She would just rather not. \r\n\r\n[b]LOCATION[/b]\r\n\r\nApril is located in Whiterun inside the Temple of Kynareth. \r\n\r\n[b]INSTALLATION[/b]\r\n\r\nJust drag and drop the file and folders into your Skyrim\\'s DATA folder.\r\n\r\n[i]REQUIRED[/i] [b]Apachiiskyhair[/b] - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168 *if you get purple hair, you might need the [u]ApachiiSkyHair_OptionalColours_v_1_4_full[/u] from under the optional part in the files section*\r\n\r\n[i]OPTIONAL[/i] However, if you want her to look like she does in the pictures, I would recommend these mods. \r\n\r\nInstall first - [b]Calientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition[/b] - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666 *including the face skin*\r\n\r\n[b]CBBE skin texture V2 V3[/b] - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6554 *install the body and face skin - when ask to overwrite, click yes.* Also, the face skin you want is the [u]Female Face skin v1_8 rev1 Fuller Lips and more character PATCH.[/u]\r\n\r\n[b]XCE - Brows[/b] - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21082\r\n\r\n[b]The Eyes of Beauty[/b] - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722\r\n\r\n[b]Remodeled Armor[/b] - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13004\r\n\r\n[b]Sharpshooters Extreme Graphics Vision ENB[/b] - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15105\r\n\r\n[b]GRAY FACE BUG FIX[/b]\r\n\r\nAlthough it shouldn\\'t show up, since I included the folders for it to have no gray face bug. However, if it does ... \r\n\r\nStep One - Open Creation Kit.\r\nStep Two - Click the folder icon on the top right, and then check Skyrim.esm, ApachiiHair.esm and then click to highlight April.esp and press the set active button, then ok.\r\nStep Three - Click Actors and then click inside the search box to type in \\\"April\\\" and find her. Now click (just have her name highlighted) and press ctrl+f4. Wait til\\' it says done and click ok. Now, don\\'t exit or save anything yet. Just open the folder ...\r\n\r\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\FaceGenData\\\\FaceTint\\\\April.esp\r\n\r\nAnd delete the two files inside that folder. Now go back to the Creation Kit(which should still be open) and save the file and exit. This should fix the gray face bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]CREDIT[/b]\r\n\r\nBethesda for Skyrim\r\nCaliente for the body mod.\r\nNavetsea for the detail body.\r\nApachii for the hairstyles.\r\nLogRaam for the beautiful eyes.\r\nXenius for the XCE eyebrows. \r\nMAK07 for the sweet armor.\r\n",
