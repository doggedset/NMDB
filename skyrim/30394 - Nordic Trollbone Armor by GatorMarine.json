  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE:\r\nVersion 0.2 is now live! Beast races can now use this armor (both of these are in their first version, let me know of any bugs or issues you find if there are any) and Trollbone Boots have been added!\r\n-Added Trollbone Boots\r\n-Added Beast race functionality\r\n-Added weight slider functionality\r\n-Added Troll Femur to Troll Death Items\r\n-Randomized Troll Death Items\r\n-Revised Tempering recipes (instead of needing a whole new Troll Skull to temper the helm, you now need Bone Meal and Troll Fat)\r\n\r\nFemale version is still on hold for the time being!\r\n\r\nPost pics and don\\'t forget to endorse if you like the progress!\r\n\r\nIntroduction:\r\nAlthough I\\'ve never played Morrowind all the way through, I\\'ve always wanted to see more mods connecting the worlds of TES:III, IV, and V aesthetically. The lack of Ice armor (which is being remedied by Dragonborn), Ringmail, and the Skaal armor from Bloodmoon always bugged me, for example. Well, I\\'ve taken a step to fix at least one of the things that I felt was missing from a Nord-centered game.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nThe armor is craftable at a forge (I may change this to tanning rack, let me know what you think) with Leather, Leather Strips, a Troll Skull, Troll Ribs, Troll Hands, and a Troll Femur. The ribs, hands, femur, and skull are now part of the loot you can get from Trolls. The armor set currently has Gauntlets, Cuirass, boots, and Helmet. \r\n\r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\nAs long as the other mod doesn\\'t alter the loot for Trolls, this mod is compatible.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Plans:\r\nI intend to do boots, but since Morrowind didn\\'t have boots, I haven\\'t yet decided on a look for them. I am also looking at adding the Troll\\'s claws to the Gloves. Once Dragonborn is released, I intend on doing a version based on the Skaal clothes. If you have any ideas / suggestions, please let me know!\r\n\r\nThanks / Permissions:\r\nSpecial thanks goes out to hothtrooper44 for letting me use the gauntlets from the excellent Hoth follower mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24666\r\nThanks also to tlrd for helping identify and kill some clipping issues.\r\nAnd yet more thanks go out to VectorPlexus, Ragicka, hardarg, and Werne for taking the time to help me figure out weight slider issues!\r\n\r\n\r\nA Note to Users:\r\nPlease give me feedback in the comments section to let me know what issues you\\'re finding. It\\'s also nice to get compliments!\r\n\r\n\r\nAddendum:\r\nIf you want your textures to look like mine, you\\'ll have to get the official HD textures pack and use the aMidianBorn fur textures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMods Used in Screenshots:\r\nAlternate Start - Live Another Life by Arthmoor\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9557\r\n\r\naMidianBorn Book of Silence by CaBaL\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24909\r\n\r\nEthereal Elven Overhaul by nuska\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24273\r\n\r\nBeards by Hvergelmir\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28363\r\n\r\nHoth by hothtrooper44\r\nskyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24666",
