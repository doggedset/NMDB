  "modName": "Bloody Cannibalism",
  "summary": "Makes cannibalism and werewolf feeding bloody.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod makes feeding on victims leave behind bloody remains, be it as a werewolf or with the Ring of Namira. The Ring of Namira buff is slightly changed, and can be further improved by consuming Namira\\'s Blight, an otherwise toxic sludge. Cannibalism is also considered a more serious crime.\r\n\r\nV 0.11 BETA\r\n- Do not enable this BETA VERSION unless you have finished the \\\"Taste Of Death\\\" quest, it will probably/definitely break the game.\r\n- Visiting the \\\"Namira\\'s Shrine\\\" will let you do stuff, read the notes in the game.\r\n- Live sacrifices aren\\'t willing sacrifices... but you can break their spirit.\r\n- TELL ME ABOUT BUGS! I\\'LL TRY TO FIX THEM!\r\n\r\nV 0.10b\r\n- Migrated to a \\\"better\\\" bloody remains, with full custom textures (they need more work, though)\r\n- Added more blood.\r\n- Vampires will get a feed buff from cannibalizing victims.\r\n- The bloody remains are now more reliably cleaned up and removed by the game, though only on cells that are reset.\r\n- Cannibalism is now a more serious crime, and most will attack you on sight.\r\n- BUG: The fade out during cannibalism isn\\'t triggering.\r\n\r\nV 0.07\r\n- This mod now requires Dawnguard. Use the old V0.05 version if you do not have it.\r\n- Added tweaks that\\'ll make sure the feeding animation will play, correctly, most of the time when using the Ring of Namira.\r\n- Made the werewolf feeding not trigger the bloody mess when it\\'s used on animals.\r\n- Added the first version of a bonus feature to the ring.\r\n- Removed the ToL compatibility patch as it doesn\\'t seem necessary anymore.\r\n\r\nV 0.05 Bonus\r\n\r\n- Preliminary quick-and-dirty compatibility for Tales of Lycanthropy.\r\n\r\nV 0.05\r\n\r\n- Fixed the problem with NCPs not respawning after being eaten (hopefully)\r\n- Added a help message when the player tries to feed during combat.\r\n- Tweaked the timing in the animations.\r\n\r\nV 0.04\r\n\r\n- Added script folder for redundancy. For some reason this seems to help make it work, probably because the creation kit seems to package the scripts wrong in some cases.\r\n\r\nV 0.03\r\n\r\n- Added gore stuff to werewolf feeding. Highly experimental, may require a fresh character.\r\n- Werewolf feeding doesn\\'t restore extra health or give an additional buff the player, and remains available during combat.\r\n\r\n\r\nV 0.02\r\n\r\n- Fixed an error in the BSA (not having the script required to make the mod work. Oops!)\r\n\r\nV. 0.01\r\n\r\n- Feeding on corpses leaves behind a bloody mess.\r\n- Feeding restores 100 health to the player if they are wounded.\r\n- Feeding grants 1 permanent health if the player is healthy.\r\n- Feeding is no longer available during combat.\r\n\r\nFuture plans:\r\n- [s]Compatibility patch for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12687]Tales of Lycanthropy[/url][/s] Unnecessary.\r\n- Extended questline for Namira\\'s Shrine.\r\n- Escalating power from Namira\\'s Ring, similar to werewolf and vampire feeding providing perks.\r\n\r\nIssues:\r\n- [s]Sometimes the feeding animation doesn\\'t play. This is a problem with the vanilla game as well, and I do not know of any way to fix it as of yet.[/s] Should be fixed for the most part.\r\n- [s]Eating respawning NPCs will stop them from respawning.[/s] Should be fixed\r\n- Sometimes the bloody remains do not appear in the right place, or in the right orientation. As of yet, I do not know how to fix this.\r\n\r\nPossible issues:\r\n- [s]The movable static items composing the gory mess are added via formID, because the editor doesn\\'t allow movable static to be included as a property. This shouldn\\'t be an issue as the main game data files are always loaded first.[/s]. Fixed since v0.10b.\r\n- Eating someone holding a quest item may cause the quest item to be unrecoverable. Testing required.\r\n- Loot may need to be stolen from the bloody remains.",
