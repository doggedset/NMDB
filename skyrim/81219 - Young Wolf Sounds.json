You will need to pack them in to your own mod as I am only providing the .wav files. THIS IS FREE TO USE FOR ANY AND EVERYTHING, IT TOOK ME 5 MINUTES TO MAKE SO have a blast. Credit is cool but I&#39;m not gonna harp on it as I may never even see where these are used. Now go modders, go and UPDATE&#33;&#33; \r<br />\r<br />If you think anything sounds weird, let me know and I can further alter them.\r<br />Credit: Me gosh dern it. Oh and I guess someone at bethesda&#39;s dog, probably.\r<br />",
