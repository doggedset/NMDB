  "descriptionHtml": "While equipped the wearer gains low tier heavy armour and melee perks from the 1 handed and 2 handed trees if they don&#39;t have them.\r<br />\r<br />Features:\r<br />Given to ranking members of the Companions. Once you&#39;ve advanced high enough in the perks tree you can give it to a follower without impacting your character&#39;s perk tree or level progression. The helm can be enchanted or tempered while allowing the added perks to function.\r<br />\r<br />How to get it:\r<br />The helm can be crafted at the forge with the steel smithing perk. In addition the player must be a member of the Companions to craft it to make it lore friendly.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Use NMM as usual. For manual install: extract the scripts folder and the esp file into skyrim data folder.\r<br />\r<br />Upgrading: \r<br />I&#39;ve renamed the ESP file so it makes sense in light of my recent changes to make it lore friendly.\r<br />\r<br />Conflicts:\r<br />The script shouldn&#39;t conflict with other mods unless they drastically alter the vanilla skill trees.\r<br />\r<br />Changelog:\r<br />v0.95 Fixed title\r<br />v0.8 Added companions faction check for crafting.\r<br />v0.7 The item can be forged and tempered.\r<br />v0.6 Fixed up fomod support\r<br />v0.5 Added new ability Executioner&#39;s vigor + 10 stamina regeneration.\r<br />v0.4 Fixed 1 handed and 2 handed perks so they use their matching pre-requisites.\r<br />v0.3 Perform checks to see if player has certain perks so as not to remove them when unequipped.\r<br />v0.2 Added new properties.\r<br />\r<br />Future plans:\r<br />Item set bonuses\r<br />\r<br />Credits and thanks:\r<br />Bethesda\r<br />Skyrim Nexus\r<br />Sky UI team\r<br />Creation Kit Wiki",
