  "descriptionHtml": "I couldn&#39;t find a single mod on the nexus or workshop that allowed you to enchant any piece of armor with any enchantment you wanted to, that didn&#39;t add any unwanted &#34;extras&#34; such as new vendors or additional enchantments.\r<br />\r<br />What this does:\r<br />Allows you enchant whatever piece of armor with whatever enchant you want, want a shield with Fortify Two Handed? Go for it.\r<br />\r<br />What this doesn&#39;t do:\r<br />Doesn&#39;t allow you to enchant weapon enchants on armor and vice versa.\r<br />Anything else.\r<br />\r<br />What this conflicts with:\r<br />Anything that modifies the formlists for the vanilla enchantments. \r<br />\r<br />Known Bugs: \r<br />None yet, please do let me know if you find any.",
