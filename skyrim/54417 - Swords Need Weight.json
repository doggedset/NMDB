  "descriptionHtml": "Hello and welcome to my first mod ever, seriously, just got the CK working and this is the first thing i could think of.\r<br />\r<br />Leaving a side my complete noobiness when it comes to modding, heres the actual mod description:\r<br />\r<br />What it does?\r<br />\r<br />What this mod does is simply increasing your weapons attack speed by a 50% by adding the new &#34;Sword Dance&#34; spell, it is a little bit overpowered, but still, go 100 on smith/enchanting and its the very same thing, the school is Alteration. The spell cannt be purchased, I have been searching, since it should, but i cannt find it in any vendor-Tolfir should have it after you hit level 50 in alteration- if anyone knows the way to do this, i thank any advice you can give me.\r<br />\r<br />What does it works on?\r<br />\r<br />Everything, from the biggest mace to the smaller dagger, including bows and crossbows.\r<br />\r<br />Getting the spell.\r<br />\r<br />To get the spell... I dont remember, seriously, it somewhere in between Solitude and Riften, just in the middle of Winterhold and Falkreath, just a little bit to the Markarth area.\r<br />\r<br />For those who didnt catch the joke, you will have to find it, its out on the world, and its the ONE copy existing. Spoiler for location on the Files section, under optional.\r<br />\r<br />Ok, i got the spell, now what?\r<br />\r<br />Just cast it during combat, or out in the wild to test it out. Enjoy it when you need that OP edge in battle.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility\r<br />\r<br />My load order is extensive, but the most critically when it comes to compatibility are usually SkyRE, and other Overhaul mods, such as Dual Wielding Redux and other, I can assure its compatible with SkyRE, SmartCast, and a huge lot of other mods. My load order is in the files section along with the file with the location of the spell.\r<br />\r<br />Future plans.\r<br />\r<br />Make it not so overpowered (maybe a 30%)\r<br />Put it on vendors/quest it, and remove it from that cold place.\r<br />Create more spells, probobly gonna go with the quest idea so i can integrate them with the lore.\r<br />\r<br />Credits.\r<br />\r<br />Myself\r<br />Bethesda for the awesome games (and the easy to mod sistem)\r<br />The Nexus team for maintaining this sites up.\r<br />\r<br />I know, i write a lot, im a writter, now go kill some Dragons&#33;",
