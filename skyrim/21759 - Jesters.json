  "descriptionHtml": "[youtube]FsB06k1ZWus[/youtube]\r\n\r\nI  was pleased to discover that Skyrim would be featuring a full set of jester clothes - but I was disappointed when there weren\\'t any real jesters in the game, only an assassin dressed like one. Where are the motley fools who entertain the Jarls and their courts?\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a unique and fully AI-packed jester to the court of each jarl. Each Jester has their own unique face and name, and will dance and play instruments for the court. Additionally, each jester has their own face paint pattern in the colour of their Hold\\'s flag (ie, yellow for Whiterun, blue for Eastmarch, etc.) and play different instruments from castle to castle - so the jester in Dragonsreach will play the drums, the jester in the Palace of the Kings the flute, the jester in Understone Keep the lute, and so on. I may also make new retextures for the jesters\\' clothes so they can dress in the colours of their Hold in a later update.",
