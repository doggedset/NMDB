  "descriptionHtml": "[color=orchid][b][u][size=4]Description[/size][/u][/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />I have created this set of screenshots to be used as a reference library for those of you who make texture mods, or if you are like me and feel the need to go through and hand-pick a variety of different textures from different mods. This library isn&#39;t intended to showcase textures from other mods, but rather to provide examples of which meshes (and where) specific textures are attached to in the game.\r<br />\r<br />Essentially, the way that it is set up is so that the screenshots correlate (almost) identically to the .dds files that are in the textures folder of your Skyrim directory. For example: Skyrim has the wrcitywall01.dds file in the data/textures/architecture/whiterun folder. In this library you will find a screenshot called wrcitywall01.jpg in the architecture/whiterun folder. Additionally, the way this library works, is by providing two screenshots of the same mesh, but having each display a different texture, so wrcitywall01.jpg can be compared directly with wrcitywall01comparison.jpg.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]Notice:[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />I had originally intended to cover a far greater amount of textures before uploading this file, however I am now uncertain as to whether or not I will continue to create screenshots for this library. With that being said, if anyone is interested in sending me screenshots of textures I have not included, I will gladly add them in and give credit - my only requirements are that they must be clear enough to identify and structured in the same manner as mine.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][b]Recommended Texture Mods/ Mods that may be featured in this Library:[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45807/?]Noble Skyrim[/url] by Shutt3r\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61995/?]Tamriel Reloaded HD[/url] by 32cm\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/607/?]Skyrim HD[/url] by Nebula\r<br />- A bunch of the aMidianBorn stuff by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/571605/?tb=mods]CaBaL120[/url]\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49344/?]Vivid Landscapes[/url] by Hein84\r<br />\r<br />I will post more as I remember which ones I have used/liked.",
