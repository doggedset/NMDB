  "descriptionHtml": "[left][font=Verdana][/font][/left][font=Arial][b]\r<br />An extremely simple mod I made for my own use sometime ago, and decided to share it after I didn&#39;t find anything else quite like it on the nexus.\r<br />\r<br />[u]What it does;[/u]\r<br />It&#39;s an ESP that adds three Two-Handed Blades Swords to Skyhaven Temple, with their own custom, texture-replacer compatible mesh. The mesh is set to be about as long as most greatswords in the game and it&#39;s a bit faster then other greatswords too (As fast as a one-handed sword) to reflect the thinner, lighter design of Katanas. The Blades sword has had some minor changes too, as it&#39;s also a bit faster and with less damage. (about as fast as a dagger). The swords (both one and two handed) have a slightly smaller damage in order to avoid any &#34;cheaty&#34; feeling and compensate for the increased speed. I&#39;m considering adding a dagger as well, for those who don&#39;t like swords or want something more suitable for their sneaky characters but still want to show some Blades pride. If enough interest is shown, I&#39;ll probably add it later. \r<br />\r<br />[u]Where to find them;[/u]   \r<br />Exactly where you find the other Blades Swords. There are normally six swords on Display in Skyhaven Temple, in a room off to the side. This just replaces three of them with greatswords. [/b][/font]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Install Instructions[/b][/u];\r<br />[b]NMM, or drag and drop into your data folder.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Note; \r<br />[/u]It turns out I&#39;m crap at taking screenshots, so thanks to TrueRevan for theirs. Greatly appreciated....\r<br />It also turns out I&#39;m unlikely to update this mod, as there really isn&#39;t much else to do with it. It does exactly what I intended it to do, and there&#39;s really not much that I can add to it aside from maybe a dagger or something, but I&#39;m not going to add that unless someone actually WANTS it...So this mod can be considered complete..[/b]",
