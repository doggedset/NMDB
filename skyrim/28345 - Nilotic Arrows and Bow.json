  "descriptionHtml": "Adds the arrows and bow used by the Nilotic people of the river Nile. The arrows are the main point of this mod, the bow is just there \\'cause i felt like it fitted. Be nice, this is my first mod I\\'ve actually completed.\r\nThe Nilotic Bow can be crafted under the Steel category and the arrows are in bundles of 50 and can be crafted under Daedric. they only require the Steel smithing perk and those who say the bow is overpowered, i made this for fun and mainly for the arrows.",
