  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=5]Sweat Mechanics for Frostfall[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]DEVELOPMENT HALTED UNTIL FF RELEASE\r<br />[/color][color=#ffff00][size=3]I&#39;m new to modding and using the Nexus, so please be patient[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]The goal of this mod is to add an extra mechanic for getting wet.  I didn&#39;t like that when I stayed out of the waterways of Skyrim, the only way to get wet was to get caught in the rain (which really didn&#39;t happen often enough for me to really care). The basic idea is that exerting yourself will cause your wetness meter to increase, making you more susceptible to cold weather. [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]There are three main parts to the mod so far:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[list][*][color=#00ff00]All stamina used makes you wet [/color]\r<br />[/*][*][color=#ff0000]Running makes you wet[/color]\r<br />[/*][*][color=#ffff00]Exposure is reduced while you are using stamina[/color]\r<br />[/*][/list]\r<br />[size=3]Breakdown:[/size][color=#00ff00]\r<br />[/color][size=3]The rate at which you get wet per percent stamina used is affected by:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[list][*]What your [color=#00ff00]exposure protection[/color] is (more protection means more sweat)\r<br />[/*][*][color=#00ff00]Environment temperature[/color] (colder temperatures mean less sweat)\r<br />[/*][/list]\r<br />[size=3]When you are running: you will gain a much smaller amount of wetness.  This will have all the [/size][color=#ff0000]same modifiers as stamina based wetness[/color][size=3].  [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Magnitude will range from insignificant in cold environments with little environmental protection, to large enough that you will become drenched in hot environments with lots of heavy gear (even without spending stamina).  [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Note:[/color][size=3] Running is not sprinting, caps lock toggles run / walk so this effect will be active unless you are on horseback, walking, sneaking, or standing still.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]When you are actively sweating, it is assumed that you are doing some physical activity, and [/size][color=#ffff00]exposure you would gain is reduced slightly.[/color][size=3]  This will only occur if you would have gained a significant amount of exposure.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Here is the part where I explain away my programming shortcomings with lore, gather around children:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Frost spells that drain stamina will add wetness.  This is magically explained away by:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[list][*]Frost that damages you melts and makes you wet\r<br />[/*][*]More clothing means more frost sticks to you\r<br />[/*][*]More absorbent (insulating) clothing absorbs more moisture\r<br />[/*][/list]\r<br />[size=3]Poisons that damage stamina will cause you to sweat.  This is more realistically explained by:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[list][*]Poison that damages stamina also causes a feverish reaction\r<br />[/*][*]Fever makes you sweat[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[size=3]Obviously this mod requires [/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11163/?]Frostfall[/url][size=3] which frickin&#39; awesome, and Chesko deserves all the credit.  I just added a few snippets of code to his masterpiece.\r<br />\r<br />[/size]If you&#39;re looking for something else to make your Frostfall experience more difficult, check out my other mod [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62778/?]Dungeon Fire Cleanup[/url].  This removes a lot of the warming fires from the Dungeons of Skyrim.  Perfect for your next hardcore play through.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]0.1.3 Release Notes: [/size]\r<br />[list][size=2]I reduced the amount of sweat from running when naked and in deadly cold climates, I thought the amount of sweat was far too much.  If you think there should be more, download V0.1.2 instead, it will make you very sweaty.  I removed sweating from using stamina for Eagle Eye.  You may still have some sweat when using Eagle Eye because FF doesn&#39;t update very often and I use FF&#39;s update interval along with a check for L and R mouse buttons, since apparently there is no variable that says when you are zooming in with a bow.  Possibly this is something that could change when multi-threading is released for FF.\r<br />[/size][/list]\r<br />[size=3]0.1.3xR Release Notes: [/size]\r<br />[list][size=2]Exactly the same as V0.1.3 except running does not add sweat.  This is compatible with all mods that cause running to use stamina, or if you feel that running should not add sweat\r<br />[/size][/list][list][/list]\r<br />[size=3]0.1.3x50 Release Notes: [/size]\r<br />[list][size=2]Exactly the same as V0.1.3 with a cap at 50% wet.  You can become more than 50% wet by sweating, but it will not be added if you are above 50%[/size][size=2][size=2]\r<br />[/size][/size][/list]\r<br />[size=3]0.1.3xL Release Notes: [/size]\r<br />[list][size=2]Exactly the same as V0.1.3 except the first 25% of stamina use is free.  The remaining 75% stamina will cause more sweat in compensation.  The total amount for spending 100% stamina is still the same.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=2]\r<br />[/size][/list][size=3]Planned Future Features:[/size]\r<br />[list][size=2]Possible widget to show BiS dirt, as well as mechanic to add dirt from sweat\r<br />Possible[/size][/list]",
