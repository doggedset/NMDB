  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#00ff00][size=5]ClefJ&#39;s Karthwasten[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Note: This was an experiment of mine using the BSCyrodiil farmhouse resources, and just some exterior facelifts in general. I&#39;ve been very busy lately, and working on a much larger town mod, this was kind of a side project. \r<br />\r<br />If anyone would like to take up this mod, I&#39;d be perfectly fine with that. \r<br />\r<br />What this mod offers is a general store trader, an inn, and a couple new buildings and models that might make the town of Karthwasten a more noticeable miner&#39;s town, with a burned-down house to note that a massacre had taken place in the village, as evident in Seasons Unending dialogue. The Inn has inn services, but without a rent room script currently, since there&#39;s also a (somewhat incomplete) player home in town too&#33; The key is in the destroyed house near the front entrance. Again, this was a side project experiment. \r<br />\r<br />No requirements other than the Skyrim and Update master files. No scripts, no fuss. ...It might need a proper cleaning if it&#39;s to be used seriously, of course. \r<br />\r<br />Thanks to [color=#00ffff]Markusliberty [/color]for the Cyrodiil Farmhouse Tileset&#33; \r<br />\r<br />I hope you like&#33; And if you decide to pick this one up to work on yourself, I wish you luck&#33; ",
