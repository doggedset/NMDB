  "modName": "Desolate Surreal Skyrim ENB Config",
  "summary": "An ENB visual enhancement with a desolate theme. This is skyrim unlike you\\'ve ever seen it. Realistic, yet cinematic, yet unrealistic at the same time. This will please (almost) everyone. Someone called this surreal, so I added it to the title. :)",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b]UPDATE: New version in the works. :) A total re-release. Stay tuned![/b]\r\n\r\n[b]UPDATE:[/b] Someone called this surreal, so I added it to the title, to say the least, it proves to have that look. :o\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i872.photobucket.com/albums/ab281/shivanthing/Skyrim%20Photoshooting/123956210-4-1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[b]NOTE THIS MAY AFFECT YOUR PERFORMANCE, IF IT DOES JUST GO INTO ENBCONFIG.ini AND DISABLE SSAO/AMBIENT OCCLUSION. OR DOWNLOAD ENB CUSTOMIZER AND DO IT FROM THERE. AS SSAO IS ONE OF THE MUCH MORE TAXING PARTS OF THIS MOD. DISABLING IT MAY CAUSE OBJECTS TO LOSE A BIT OF DEPTH.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]IMPORTANT NOTICE- REUPLOADING VERSION 1.3 DUE TO NEEDING A HOTFIX.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]UPDATE- I\\'ve hit a final version, I don\\'t expect to be working on this anymore as I\\'ve balanced everything out. Hope you all enjoy it! Feel free to grab an old version if you like it as my tastes will vary from yours. But as always, enjoy.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]If you don\\'t like the aesthetic changes in version 1.2 feel? free to use an \\'old\\' version. As they still have a good appeal. *ahem* *points to below screenshot of first version* There are also comparisons now so you can imagine a sort of visual timeline between the some of the past and major versions.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Video[/b]\r\n[youtube]9QwyrMc7xzI[/youtube]\r\n\r\n!!!!!!Please Read!!!!!!\r\n\r\nREUPLOADED EVERYTHING WITHOUT SOURCE FILES DUE TO COPYRIGHT ISSUES!!! READ INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS TO GET THIS TO WORK!\r\n\r\nLEAVE COMMENTS, I love them! Good or negative! :) If you like it and plan to play with it and enjoy it, please endorse it! If there\\'s anything that can be improved upon, please let me know! :)\r\n\r\nI seem to releasing ENB configs a day, and have released 2 previous \\'brighter\\' ENB configs, this config strays away from that \\'bright\\' style and bring out the colors in a much more serene and unique way. This makes skyrim look far more desolate.\r\n\r\n---WHAT THIS IS---\r\nStraight and to the point- this is a config that brings out skyrim\\'s colors to make skyrim appear more desolate, expect everytime of the day under every condition to have just the right amount of lighting, fog, and what not.\r\n\r\n---WHAT THIS ISN\\'T--\r\nThis isn\\'t a realistic config, it\\'s more of an artistic cinematic config, if you\\'ve seen the screenshots, you know what to expect.\r\n\r\n---FEATURES---\r\n******[b]A very vivid horizon.[/b] (Since version 3) That offsets the rest of the world very very well. If you don\\'t like the bloomy horizon feel free to use the more depth version. It makes the world a bit more dark for one\\'s tastes, and lesses that bloomy horizon. But I highly reccommend the regular version with the bloomy horizon. The horizon really creates an effect and the volumetric clouds look amazing and mystifying.******\r\n\r\n***[b]A dark and desolate skyrim that has a very unforgiving look.[/b] You saw vanilla skyrim, you perhaps it wasn\\'t barren enough, perhaps the color scheme was a bit too close to fantasy land... well worry no more. This config takes the fantasy land vanilla look and gives it a falcon punch.***\r\n\r\n***[b]Intense light rays[/b] With the bloomy horizon, they look brilliant. And with the more depth version... They still look brilliant. ;)***\r\n\r\n[b]Like what you read? Go grab the config now! :D[/b]\r\n\r\n---ISSUES THAT I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SOLVE BUT I\\'ll TRY IN THE FUTURE---\r\nTwo tradeoffs- nothing major, not too annoying, but still, tradeoffs they are. Skin appear\\'s slightly reddish depending on the time of day and where you are. (may not appear red at all- it\\'s all in the color pallete.) Hair is out of color, black hair may appear grayish. Again this depends on where you are. You may have black/brown hair for all I know. But don\\'t let that deter you, you\\'ll hardly notice it at times and if you do you won\\'t even care.\r\n\r\n---INSTALLATION---\r\nJust drop the contents of the RAR in your root directory, if you got a current skyrim ENB config, back it up. If you don\\'t have software to open RAR files go grab winrar from here. Copy the address into your address bar.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rarlab.com/\r\n\r\n After you install those contents, go to boris vorontsov\\'s website and get the ENBinjector.exe. It can be found here. Copy and paste the link into your address bar. Drop this into your root directory as well.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.enbdev.com/download_injector_generic.htm\r\n\r\n---UNINSTALLATION---\r\nJust delete everything that came with the mod.\r\n\r\n---HOW TO USE---\r\nInstall this config as described, then run the ENBinjetor.exe before running skyrim. Then run skyrim to get it to work.\r\n\r\n---NOTE---\r\nYou may ask \\\"Why is it so dark?!\\\" Or \\\"Why is it so bright?!?!\\\" Please note our monitor levels differ, so adjust the brightness ingame to your liking. HOWEVER a darker atmosphere is a part of this mod, so do not be confused. It may or may not be difficult to tell the difference from the depth and the actual brightness. Look at the video for a good reference to gamma!\r\n\r\n---RECOMMENDED MODS---\r\nMore Rain- This config was designed around it, so consider grabbing it! (Not Requried)\r\nMore Snow- This config was designed around it, so consider grabbing it! (Not Required)\r\nBetter Females By Bella- Was used in the making of the screen shots! (Not Required)\r\nSkyrim HD 2k Textures- If you got enough Vram (1gb) go for it! (Not Required)\r\n\r\n---SCEENIES---\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i872.photobucket.com/albums/ab281/shivanthing/Skyrim%20Photoshooting/123957347-4.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i872.photobucket.com/albums/ab281/shivanthing/Skyrim%20Photoshooting/ShowdownPartOne.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i872.photobucket.com/albums/ab281/shivanthing/Skyrim%20Photoshooting/AlethaInTheBreeze.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i872.photobucket.com/albums/ab281/shivanthing/Skyrim%20Photoshooting/Desperation.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i872.photobucket.com/albums/ab281/shivanthing/Skyrim%20Photoshooting/Monarch.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n",
