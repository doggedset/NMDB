Click open, choose a save game file.\r<br />\r<br />2. Click &#34;FixScriptInstances&#34;, it removes all orphan script instances.\r<br />\r<br />3.

This is what worked for me:\r<br />\r<br />1) Be very careful here&#33; I used this Skyrim utility, version 2.06 BETA. \r<br />However, I did not use any of the advanced options and did not click the\r<br /> &#34; Delete # &#34; button. Also, I made sure that I check-marked the &#34; Create\r<br /> Backup &#34; check-box before I saved just in case things went bad&#33; You \r<br />never know&#33;\r<br />\r<br />2) I deleted old game saves that I no longer needed. This is also good for your PC overall because it frees up hard-drive \r<br />space&#33; Your Skyrim game saves are located in a folder found in Windows: \r<br />Documents&gt;My Games&gt;Skyrim&gt;Saves. Be very careful here not \r<br />delete game saves that you actually still want to load or use&#33; I would \r<br />leave yourself about 5 to 10 recent game saves just in case one becomes \r<br />corrupt or something. You never know&#33; An easy way to do this is to \r<br />organize the folder by date where the most recent date is at the top of \r<br />the screen. These are your most recent game saves so DO NOT DELETE \r<br />THESE&#33; Or, you will lose your most recent progress in your game&#33; \r<br />\r<br />3) I started up Skyrim and loaded up the game save that I edited with this\r<br /> Skyrim utility. Once in game open the console by pressing ~ and type: \r<br />player.kill followed by the &#34; Enter &#34; key. Then, close the console by \r<br />pressing ~ again. This will instantly kill your player&#33; Sorry. But, just\r<br /> wait a little bit and you will be reincarnated&#33; Now, upon being \r<br />reincarnated, you can save your game again&#33; Magic&#33; Ta da&#33; I guess when \r<br />you died you were able to talk to the save game Gods? [img]http://forums.nexusmods.com/public/style_emoticons/dark/tongue.gif[/img]\r<br />\r<br />4) Save your game if you have not already done so. You should now be good to go&#33; [img]http://forums.nexusmods.com/public/style_emoticons/dark/biggrin.gif[/img] Have fun&#33; [img]http://forums.nexusmods.com/public/style_emoticons/dark/biggrin.gif[/img] Problem solved&#33; [img]http://forums.nexusmods.com/public/style_emoticons/dark/biggrin.gif[/img]\r<br />\r<br />5) For those still having issues, try getting rid of some of the stuff in \r<br />your player&#39;s inventory so that your carry weight is not too high. I \r<br />have heard that having too high of a carry weight can also cause your \r<br />game to CTD when saving&#33; However, this issue is rare. But, be mindful of\r<br /> this if you are still having issues. Getting rid of some of the stuff \r<br />that you are carrying in your player&#39;s inventory might be something to \r<br />try. However, I have personally not experienced any issues with this \r<br />particular carry weight problem even when I was way way over my player&#39;s\r<br /> carry limit creeping out of a really creepy dungeon&#33; So, if you are \r<br />still having issues, once you have followed steps 1-3 try removing some \r<br />stuff from your player&#39;s inventory until your carry weight is good and \r<br />then try saving AKA step 4 from above ^. Hopefully, this works for you \r<br />now&#33;\r<br />\r<br />- awjnash - [/quote]Another thing you can try, if saving a game crashes, is to click a &#39;del. broken actives&#39; button after you cleaned orphan scripts.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]xwSA3pJgA5A[/youtube]\r<br />Thanks to CHABAL\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]5CeX-8MDOBQ[/youtube]\r<br />For versions 1.00 - 1.13\r<br />Thanks to LiveStyleGaming\r<br />\r<br />Information used when creating this tool:\r<br />http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes5Mod:Save_File_Format\r<br />\r<br />Tools used:\r<br />RosAsm\r<br />ResEdit\r<br />Ollydbg 2",
