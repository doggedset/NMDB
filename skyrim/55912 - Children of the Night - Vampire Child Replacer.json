IF NOT THEN GO AWAY this mod won&#39;t be for you, now for you who are read on.... \r<br />\r<br />You go play Hearthfire and build yourself a house and look for a child to adopt but most of the children you meet are not Evil enough and would probably end up as your Characters next meal, Well then if so it would be about time you meet &#34;Reeve&#34; the Creepy little Vampire Boy who is stuck as a mere 11 year old for the rest of his existance, The perfect Child to Adopt for all you Evil Immortal characters out there wether you are a Vampire or some wierd necromancer looking for a wierd son he is slightly Taller then the other Children as he is a bit Older, He will attack enemies using vampire spells if threatened he wont run off like other Children you can find him wondering Dawnstar&#33;&#33; \r<br />Despite having an invisibilty spell of his own he will still ask you to make him invisible if you cast spells in front of him \r<br />\r<br />I highly suggest you don&#39;t provoke him unless you have a Killable Children mod otherwise Children are invunerable and he will probaly kill you if you do because of it but what you see is what you get...A creepy adoptable little boy \r<br />\r<br />He uses Vampiric Drain \r<br />He uses Vampiric Invisibility \r<br />He wields a Daedric Dagger \r<br />He has Vampirism \r<br />Has Dialogue if the Sun is Blocked out (then again so does Babette) \r<br />97% Evil Guaranteed ",
