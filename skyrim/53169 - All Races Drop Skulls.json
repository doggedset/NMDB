  "descriptionHtml": "This mod gives races skulls, which you may loot from NPCs (non-player characters) after they die. Each skull is as anatomically correct as possible for its race and bears the name of the race. There are also named skulls for many named NPCs, and more will be added by request. \r<br />\r<br />Those who might like this mod: Vampire hunters who want a skull for each vampire killed, instead of a lousy pair of vampire boots&#33; Dark Brotherhood assassins who collect a trophy for each assassination. Stormcloaks or Imperial Legionaries who seek to intimidate by heaping a pile of enemy skulls outside a city gate. \r<br />\r<br />======== \r<br />Contents \r<br />======== \r<br />\r<br />1.

Frequently Asked Questions \r<br />=========================== \r<br />\r<br />Q. Who should consider this mod? \r<br />A. Vampire hunters, Dark Brotherhood assassins, and others who collect trophies from prey or foes.\r<br />\r<br />Q. Any DLCs required? \r<br />A. No, but this mod is compatible. \r<br />\r<br />Q. How do I get the skulls? \r<br />A. Kill an NPC, activate its corpse and take the skull. \r<br />\r<br />Q. Can I get skulls for NPCs I&#39;ve already killed? \r<br />A. No. You can only loot skulls from those slain after subscribing to this mod. But if you really want a skull, I will explain how to use the Command Console to get it. \r<br />\r<br />Q. What can I do with the skulls? \r<br />A. Sell them, display them, or pile them up to show your prowess in battle. \r<br />\r<br />Q. Is there furniture to display the skulls on? \r<br />A. An optional add-on mod will add furniture to display skulls. \r<br />\r<br />Q. Did you add skulls to all NPCs? \r<br />A. Yes, with some exceptions. Every effort was made to ensure each NPC has a skull. \r<br />\r<br />Q. Do any NPCs of a supported race have no skulls? \r<br />A. Yes, ghosts (who are disembodied) and children (because taking their skulls seems wrong)&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Q. Will you add skulls for Dawnguard and Dragonborn? \r<br />A. I&#39;ll make optional add-on mods if this mod gets enough subscribers and thumbs up. \r<br />\r<br />Q. Do any NPCs have skulls with their names? \r<br />A. Yes, a list of these is on the Discussions page. \r<br />\r<br />Q. Will you add more named skulls? \r<br />A. Yes. Give me NPC names, so I may add them. \r<br />\r<br />Q. Will you add skulls for other races, like trolls? \r<br />A. For these skulls, subscribe to Dragons, Giants, Mammoths and Trolls Drop Skulls. But let me know of any other races you want. \r<br />\r<br />Q. Are you open to suggestions for changing skulls? \r<br />A. Sure&#33; Tell me changes you want me to consider. \r<br />\r<br />Q. Why did I get a vampire skull when I killed a Nord, Dark Elf, etc.? \r<br />A. There are some NPCs who are hiding the fact they are vampires, or who contract vampirism. \r<br />\r<br />Q. What do I do if an NPC has no skull? \r<br />A. Tell me the NPCs race, name and occupation, so I may add the skull. \r<br />\r<br />Q. Should I tell you if an NPC has two skulls? \r<br />A. Yes, it&#39;s a bug. Give me the race and name so I may fix it. For now, keep the extra one. Maybe the NPC was carrying a skull of a fallen friend or foe? \r<br />\r<br />Q. Can I use skulls to make potions, weapons or armor? \r<br />A. No, but let me know if this is something you want. \r<br />\r<br />Q. Will you upload this mod to Steam, too? \r<br />A. The mod is already featured on Steam.\r<br />\r<br />Q. Will you answer other questions? \r<br />A. Please ask&#33; \r<br />\r<br />================================ \r<br />7. Incompatibilities With Other Mods \r<br />================================ \r<br />\r<br />No confirmed incompatibilities. \r<br />\r<br />============= \r<br />8. Known Bugs \r<br />============= \r<br />\r<br />All known bugs have been fixed where NPCs were missing skulls, or had the wrong skulls for their races. There are still a few NPCs who have two skulls, which will be fixed in future updates. For now, you may consider any extra skull one the NPC took from a fallen comrade or foe. \r<br />\r<br />============= \r<br />9. Uninstalling \r<br />============= \r<br />\r<br />Use the Nexus Mod Manager, or manually remove the three files named races_skulls_sp0 from the Data folder. \r<br />\r<br />================= \r<br />10.
