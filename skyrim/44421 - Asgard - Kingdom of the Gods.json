I DON&#39;T HAVE TIME TO WORK ON THIS ATM, BUT I WILL MAKE A NEW LOD SOON. NOT EVERYONE IS HAVING THE FREYJA PROBLEM, SO YOU MIGHT NOT NEED THE COMMAND&#33; IT MAY BE A BETTER IDEA TO USE THE V1.0 FOR NOW&#33; THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS YOU WILL NOT HAVE TELEPORTS TO/FROM ASGARD AFTER THE QUEST IS COMPLETE.\r<br />\r<br />[center][i]The Ancient Gods.

If you want to see the preview find it under the &#34;videos&#34; tab or at: http://youtu.be/ObjQaOv0hZM\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://img15.imageshack.us/img15/2681/g0vo.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />V1.0 - Public Release\r<br />V1.1 - Added teleport spells that teleport to Valhalla, and back to Skyrim. They are in your Valhalla residence&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://img593.imageshack.us/img593/1078/1kyb.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />Long ago, when the Nords still lived on Atmora and were called Atmorans, three divine beings came from the void. A handful of the Atmorans swore fealty to the gods and began to worship them. The gods and their followers disappeared as quickly as they had come, in the dead of night. The gods and those who had followed them were quickly forgotten as the great warrior Ysgrammor took another group of his people to Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />Now, a strange man, Bjorn Ironside, has arrived at the Windpeak Inn in Dawnstar. He&#39;s asking about the Dragonborn, so it may be a good idea to pay him a visit and see what he needs.\r<br />\r<br />This quest will take you on a journey to a brand new worldspace. Put you up against vicious, strong foes and let you sit and speak with the Gods themselves. The reward? How does your own private residence in Valhalla sound? Not enough? How about a chest filled to the brim with every item seen in this mod (except Loki&#39;s armor/mask)?\r<br />\r<br />There is now 2 spell tomes on the dresser as soon as you enter your Valhalla residence. These will allow you to teleport between Asgard and Skyrim without going through the Ancient Temple. Teleport to Valhalla places you inside Valhalla, Teleport to Skyrim places you right outside the Ancient Temple. This will make the player home much more convenient. \r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve tested the quest on a level 31 tank style on apprentice difficulty. I used a total of 35 Ultimate Healing Potions, so if your higher leveled and/or on a higher difficulty, you should bring plenty more, the final boss fight is pretty epic. \r<br />\r<br />Some of the armors in the mod are male/female only, and there will probably never be an opposite gender version of that armor.\r<br />\r<br />This mod goes well with mine: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/44216//?\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://img703.imageshack.us/img703/2217/tguw.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />Apachii Hair IS required.
