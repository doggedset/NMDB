Now it does 15 damage for 5 seconds instead, its not overpowered but suits the shield far more. It still found the same way and changes nothing other then the damage output.[/center]\r\n\r\n[color=red][font=times new roman]--A little Extra Info--\r\nSome people have asked about making the shield unenchantable and allowing you to put the enchant on another item. The problem here is, the actual shield is not enchanted per say, it is infact an effect placed on it via a spell rather then an enchant. I have previously made the shield unenchantable but the enchant does not show up. A brand new enchant would have to be written but then you run the risk of making it OP using Enchanting Potions etc and thats not something I\\'d like to do (I\\'m super lore friendly when it comes to this stuff). Plus theres no other shields in the game (vanilla anyway) that have spikes to justify allowing this bleed effect.[/font][/color]\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy it as much as I do. It being one of my favorite shields I just felt it needed that little push!\r\n\r\nAnd remember, if you enjoy it, put an endorse on it!",
