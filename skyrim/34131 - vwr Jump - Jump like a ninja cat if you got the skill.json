  "modName": "vwr Jump - Jump like a ninja cat if you got the skill",
  "summary": "Gives you the ability to jump onto a house from the ground, or scale enemy forts where they don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t expect it.",
  "descriptionHtml": "There is now a version that requires ONLY Skyrim. The ScriptDragon version is better and if you have the ability to compare them both, I am open to argument on that point.\r\n\r\nGives you a super boost jump. The height of the jump depends on how quickly your can press \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'sneak,sneak,jump\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'. See the video.\r\n\r\nInstallation: \r\n   Vanilla: Unzip to your Skyrim Data folder, activate in NMM or your launcher. Sneak-sneak-JUMP!\r\n\r\n   Script Dragon: Make sure you have the latest version of Script Dragon. Unzip the file vwrJump.asi and save it into your Skyrim folder (not Data folder).\r\n\r\nUsage: The plugin will display a message in the top left corner when you load your game \\\"vwrJump Initialized.\\\". Once that happens, do the following:\r\n\r\nWith your character standing, press sneak TWICE then jump, as fast as you can. Sneak, sneak, jump.\r\n\r\nWhen you go from standing to sneak, a timer starts taking points away from the \\'jump height\\' so the longer you take to un-sneak, the less jump points you get. Then when you unsneak, another timer fires and only gives you a split second to press the jump button, otherwise you lose it and have to start all over. I did this because I both wanted it to require some skill for the full effect, and I wanted it to be somewhat controllable. Once you use it for a few minutes and play around with how long you take to press sneak the SECOND time, you\\'ll realize you don\\'t \\'always\\' have to jump 20 feet ;)\r\n\r\nScript Dragon Version: Every time you use the jump, it will print in the console how many jump points you got. It also prints your \\'normal\\' jump points so do it a few times and look for the number that changes.\r\n\r\n[youtube]iw-i0AuLxKE[/youtube]\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nWafflesalot - Scripting and Debugging help",
