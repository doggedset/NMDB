The Emergency Merchant fixes that&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]This mod adds a merchant, along with a spell for summoning her, in Arcadia&#39;s Cauldron in Whiterun. The merchant carries 20,000 gold for selling loot (that you were probably going to sell anyway) along with all sorts of Health, Stamina, and Magicka potions that any Dragonborn might need on an expedition through Tamriel. All you need to do is go to Arcadia&#39;s Cauldron and a new NPC named &#34;Emergency Merchant&#34; should be there, along with a new spell book on the counter next to her. You can also buy the Spell from her if it does not show up on the counter. Simply use the spell book and boom&#33; You now have the &#34;Summon Emergency Merchant&#34; spell and the ability to conjure her anywhere for 30 seconds&#33; After her 30 seconds are up, she returns to her spot at Arcadia&#39;as Cauldron where you can trade with her any time&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]Installation[/b][/size]\r<br />[size=3]To install, simply download with the Nexus Mod Manager and activate it through there, or download it manually and drag all the files in the archive to your Data folder.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]Sidenote[/b][/size]\r<br />[size=3]This is my first mod, so I apologize in advance if there are any bugs/issues with this first release. I&#39;ll try to keep up with it and update it if there are any problems or if I have any ideas regarding adding something. Thanks and enjoy&#33;[/size]",
