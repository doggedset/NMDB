  "descriptionHtml": "Ever wondered why circlets are so heavy? Ever dropped valuable(ish) circlets just because they weight 2 units? Yeah me too. Surprisingly I didn&#39;t find a mod for this on Nexus so here&#39;s one, as simple as it can be. All enchanted and non-enchanted circlets, including mage&#39;s circlet now weight only 0.5 units, and the Diadem of the Savant weights 1.0. For Dawnguard users, Aetherium crown now also weights 1.0.\r<br />\r<br />So there you go, that&#39;s all this mod does. Hope you enjoy it, I know I do&#33; Endorse and vote for file of the month ;)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Don&#39;t know how to install? No worries, I will tell you how&#33; If you have Nexus Mod Manager, just click download with manager, and then in the manager activate the mod and you&#39;re good to go&#33; But if you want to install manually, you need to navigate to your &#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;skyrim&#92;Data folder and drop the esp in there and activate it in Skyrim launcher (or NMM).\r<br />\r<br />But only download and activate one file&#33; If you have Dawnguard, download the file that says Dawnguard. If you don&#39;t have Dawnguard, download the one that says Vanilla.",
