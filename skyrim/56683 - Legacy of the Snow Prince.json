  "descriptionHtml": "~Long ago on the island of Solsthiem, there was a mighty battle between the forces of Men and Elves. The Elven forces were seemingly overwhelmed, and the snow ran red with blood. But the tides turned when the greatest of the Elves, the Snow Prince, rode into the fray. \r<br />After decimating the army of Men the Snow Prince was killed by a young girl of 12 years. When the Elves laid down their weapons, the Men buried the great Elven warrior in a small tomb to honour his courage. That tomb was Jolgeirr Barrow.~ \r<br />\r<br />200 years ago, the Nerevarine reclaimed the Snow Prince&#39;s armour and spear, and presumably used them over the course of their adventures. At the time of Alduin&#39;s Return however, the barrow seems to have become forgotten and lost. But now it has been found. \r<br />Just to the south-east of Moesring Pass lies the tomb of the Snow Prince, Jolgeirr Barrow. Battle through the earthquake-ravaged ruins, find lost treasures, and gaze in awe at the spectacular landscape. Who knows, you might receive a message from an old friend. \r<br />\r<br />WHAT THIS MOD DOES - You will need Dawnguard and Dragonborn. Seriously. \r<br />It adds a Snow Elven/Ancient Nord ruin to the Solstheim world, in an unassuming spot that shouldn&#39;t be altered by other mods. \r<br />2 new interior cells, Jolgeirr Barrow and Tomb of the Snow Prince. \r<br />Exactly 6 respawning foes. \r<br />THE ARMOUR OF THE SNOW PRINCE&#33; \r<br />Lots of nice Stalhrim to pick away at. If the animations don&#39;t work, just whack at them with a pick. \r<br />Newly enchanted Ancient Nordic Pickaxe. \r<br />THE SPEAR OF THE SNOW PRINCE&#33;&#33; \r<br />\r<br />There&#39;s a gate blocking the entrance to Jolgeirr Barrow, but if you&#39;re clever, and have spring loaded shoes, you shouldn&#39;t have a problem. \r<br />The ruin is also made as a sort of one-way-trip, but there IS a way out from the end, but you just can&#39;t backtrack. \r<br />If there are any questions, please just ask. \r<br />\r<br />CREDITS \r<br />Elven Steel Armor made by jreese46 (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=239291363) \r<br />Spear made by Matth85 \r<br />Mod made by Aetherderius",
