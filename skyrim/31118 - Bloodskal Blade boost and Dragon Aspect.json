  "summary": "Ups the damage from the energy of the Bloodskal Blade and allows Dragon Aspect to be used multiple times a day. DRAGONBORN REQUIRED",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod, so go easy. As expected of a first mod, it\\'s sort of a cheat, sort of an end-game enchancer.\r\n\r\nI found it rather annoying how the Bloodskal Blade\\'s energy projection only does 30 damage per hit. Having gotten to rather high levels, it barely does anything to help out. This mod changes the damage it does from 30, to around 200. I know it\\'s probably cheating, but each unto their own.\r\n\r\nAnother change, added as a bonus, is the ability to use the Dragon Aspect shout as many times a day as you desire. You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re the Ultimate Dragonborn now. You should be able to do that.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, this requires Dragonborn to be of any use to you.\r\n\r\nIf people can test it out and see whether there are any bugs, glitches or associated unintentional items, don\\'t hesitate to say so. Heck, swear at me if you feel it helps, as I need a motivator in order to get things done these days.\r\n\r\nEdit: Updated the file, atleast twice now. There are now different versions: Classic (200 dmg), 100, 75, 50, and dare I say it, 500 dmg options. There is also an optional file included which allows usage of the Dragon Aspect buff seperately. Don\\'t use it with the 200 dmg version however, as that one already has it included.",
