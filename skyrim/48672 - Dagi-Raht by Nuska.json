  "summary": "A re-upload of the Dagi-Raht by Nuska -- a little modified.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Hey all&#33;\r<br />\r<br />First of all, I&#39;d like to credit Nuska for her fabulous work--which is this. I just re-uploaded it, thanks to her Modders&#39; Resource Pack.\r<br />\r<br />Second of all, I&#39;m not an adept modder. This is sure to have bugs. But I&#39;m putting it out on the Nexus to get other people to help me test it since I haven&#39;t got much time on my hands currently. However, I&#39;m willing to fix any and all (hopefully) bugs in this mod.\r<br />\r<br />Thirdly, description time&#33; A lot of you are probably here because you know what the Dagi-Raht are. But if you&#39;re new, I&#39;ll use a quote from Nuska&#33; &#34;Dagi-Raht originate from the southern Tenmar woods. Much is not known about them - they are thought to be magically inclined, using their feline instincts and their protective, vibrant colouring to hide themselves in plain sight. They can also wield potent destructive magic in combat. They make great thieves and illusionists, but don&#39;t shy away from battle either.&#34; \r<br />\r<br />IMPORTANT: You NEED a racial compatibility mod for the vampirism to work. Just search for it here on the nexus, there&#39;s plenty. (This WILL crash without one&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />SUCH AS:\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24168/?\r<br />\r<br />I realize many people use CBBE or UNP or ADEC or variations of any of those. BUT, these textures are VANILLA based. As I am unskilled in the world of texturing, I am hoping someone in the modding community takes it upon themselves to adapt the textures to their favorite body.\r<br />EDIT: I added the old UNP, CBBE, and Better Males compatible textures. They are manual install only because of the options of base, stripes, or spots.\r<br />\r<br />Uploaded a fix by Charismoon for the floating khajiit hairs and eyes. It will make the Dagi Raht not recognized as Khajiit, however. You have to download the main file, then the fix.\r<br />\r<br />Another thing...vampirism doesn&#39;t work flawlessly (yet&#33;) unfortunately. For the time being, after becoming a vampire simply open the console and type setrace.dagirahtracevampire and that should do the trick for now.\r<br />\r<br />There you have it, folks. Enjoy, and please feel free to comment on any bugs you find&#33; Please be respectful about it though. And thoroughly explain the problem.\r<br />\r<br />FAQ:\r<br />\r<br />1) I&#39;m crashing at the main menu&#33; WHAT DO I DO?&#33;?\r<br />A) You&#39;re missing a master. Most likely the Racial Compatibility. Or from another mod.\r<br />\r<br />2) I&#39;m crashing because _____________.\r<br />A) While I&#39;m positive this is compatible with most mods, I can&#39;t fix anything on your end if you don&#39;t give me a mod list. You need to elaborate on exactly what the bug/crash is too. Just telling me &#34;I&#39;m crashing&#34; or &#34;It&#39;s bugged&#34; doesn&#39;t help me find out WHAT is wrong with it.\r<br />\r<br />3) I see floating Khajiit hairs and eyes in the race menu?\r<br />A) It&#39;s because I made it so the Dagi are recognized as Khajiit. However, there is a fix by Charismoon that is in the optional files. You&#39;ll no longer be recognized as Khajiit, however.\r<br />\r<br />4) KHAJIIT REPLACER???\r<br />A) Honestly, I like the Suthay-Raht (the Khajiit you see in the game) as they are. So I&#39;m not interested in making a replacer. You&#39;re free to use these assets to make one though. Also if someone needs help figuring it out, just PM me.\r<br />\r<br />5) Texture Compatibility???\r<br />A) The new, nicer textures are vanilla based but work with UNP as well. There are also optional downloads for the old UNP/CBBE/Better Males textures.\r<br />\r<br />6) Schlongs?\r<br />A) Nope, not inherently compatible because it uses a custom skeleton. I don&#39;t have time to make a patch though.\r<br />\r<br />PERMISSIONS:\r<br />CREDIT NUSKA FOR ANYTHING YOU UPLOAD USING THESE ASSETS&#33; SERIOUSLY. She put a lot of hard work into all these assets and art. It would be a SIN to not credit her. No need to credit me though, I&#39;m just re-uploading a long lost popular mod. Minorly tweaked.\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS:\r<br />Nuska. For all assets and art. I just made it playable again.",
