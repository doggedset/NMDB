Progress might Be stopped as of this weekend because of finals leading into ACT tests and stuff, and ya know I kinda wanna graduate :D\r<br />\r<br />-Lines 230/895\r<br />\r<br />Personal Quest\r<br />\r<br />-Lines 65/200\r<br />\r<br />-NPC&#39;s 1/5\r<br />\r<br />Progress 15/100%\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/y0l6NEF.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Tamaria is my main PC, who has been converted into a follower. She&#39;s based on the antics and absurdity of her Skyrim persona, as well as my own. To sum her up simply, she&#39;s an asshole. The only thing she cares about is herself, and having a good time (usually at the expense of other people&#39;s lives) So if you need a best friend who has no regard for human life, she&#39;s your girl. As she stands she can tag along to help you on your adventures. She can carry your crap, kill crap for you, or just stand in your way as you try to shoot magic at a bandit. Either way she&#39;s there to serve.\r<br />\r<br />[heading]A bio of sorts[/heading]\r<br />\r<br />Tamaria is an enigma as far as the people of Skyrim are concerned. Some say she&#39;s a daedric blight from Oblivion, others a deadly succubus with a lack of regard for human life, and the majority claiming she&#39;s just an asshole with too much time on her hands. Either way you can still enjoy her company. She likes long walks on the blood beaches of Oblivion, eating sweetrolls, sleeping, shooting Ice Spikes, and sexual harassment. She dislikes, mudcrabs, bears, Thalmor, spiders, city guards, and Nazeem....she friggin hates that guy.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/pLrfvQy.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />My long-term plan is to make her a custom-voiced follower. I&#39;ve already recorded most of her lines, and have learned how to implement said lines into her character and assign dialogue. She&#39;ll mostly have custom audio for the certain commands you give her such as saying &#34;So, what kinky outfit am I going to be wearing today,&#34; when you ask to trade or &#34;if you need me I&#39;ll be somewhere, don&#39;t know where, but somewhere,&#34; when you dismiss her as a follower, and other miscellaneous battle grunts and noises. Such as when she is in &#34;sneak&#34; mode near Falmer she&#39;ll whisper &#34;They can&#39;t see us, so hold in any farts ya got...ooops...nevermind,&#34; or when she&#39;s actively engaged in &#34;combat&#34; with Thalmor she&#39;ll yell &#34;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s worse? Their attitude or their fashion sense&#33;&#34; and other such tidbits.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/hAzVAgN.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[list][*]She can be found at the Sleeping Giant Inn, in Riverwood where most people store their crap.[line][*]To get Tamaria to look exactly how she does in the pics, all elfy and whatnot you&#39;ll need the following. [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/21459/?] NouserHeres Ears [/url] Simply download them, open the &#34;console&#34; type in &#34;Ears 07&#34; and equip them to her [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35056/?] Facial Piercings [/url] Simply download them, open the &#34;console&#34; type in &#34;All Piercings&#34; and equip them to her[line][*]Also she only comes with the face tattoo, the body tattoos are not transmittable because they&#39;re a Race Overlay plugin, but you can equip her with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37108/?] Equipable Tattoos[/url] if you wish to make her body more lively.[line][*][color=#FFFF00]&gt;&gt;&gt;UNFORTUNATELY SHE WILL NOT ATTACK INNOCENTS DUE TO AN OVERSIGHT IN HER DISPOSITION/MORALITY SETTING&lt;&lt;&lt;[/color][line][*]Alternate BodiesDiversity is the spice of life, or so I&#39;d like to believe. So I&#39;ve made, and in the future will continue to make Tamaria compatible with multiple body mods, and there respected armor conversions. Now you can enjoy her in different shapes and sizes. These files have been added to the download section. Tamaria&#39;s body comes in (7base)(UNPK)(UNP Skinny)(ADEC)(CBBE)(CHSBHC) I&#39;ll probably add more bodies later on.[line][*]If you are using an ENB with alot of bloom and saturation, she will be a noticeable orange hue.[line][*]If you like this mod any support, feedback, dirty laundry or even images of your own are welcome :3[line][*]MOSTLY EVERYTHING YA NEED TO KNOW IS IN THE DESCRIPTIONS BENEATH THESE FILLER IMAGES :3[line][*]Armors Not Included With Mod[/list] \r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/ZLTZIpN.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[heading]My Save Game[/heading]\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ll be uploading my current save file with a preset for my main, PC and a very short list of mod requirements. The save is a 100% complete save spanning across the main game, and all DLC. Meaning all side quests, main quests, and guild quests are done save for those infinite repeatable quests. Also the civil war quest is done, with the Stormcloaks being sided with (which I kinda regret, but Thalmors suck more) so If you don&#39;t want a bunch of conceited Nords ruling your lands, this file isn&#39;t for you.\r<br />\r<br />[heading]Extra HDT Jiggle[/heading]\r<br />\r<br />Tamaria&#39;s body is usable with a personal HDT physics file that I&#39;ve tinkered with, it&#39;s an SKSE folder so simply put it in your data folder [color=#ff0000]NOTE:IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED YOU BACK UP YOUR SKSE FOLDER. THE FILES SHOULD UNDOUBTEDLY WORK, BUT ITS BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY, AND I DON&#39;T WANNA HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT SOMEONE&#39;S PC EXPLODING OR SOMETHING.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/R49kjMU.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />Thanks to the awesome Expired6978 for converting her into a follower for me :3\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35474/?] Ningheim Race Mod [/url] by Seren4XX Which is what Tamaria&#39;s race is based from\r<br />Zaselim for the custom body mesh & Armors\r<br />Bethesda for making such a deliciously modded game\r<br />NewSea, for the hair mod\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6709/?] DIMONIZED UNP [/url] female body by dimon99\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6709/?] UNPk TBBP [/url] female body by gooboo\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36992/?] SevenBase [/url] female body by Crosscrusade DeMoNhUnTeR1986 Sevennity\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/4888/?] CHSBHC [/url] female body by Cherry Hotaling\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666/?] CBBE [/url] female body by Caliente\r<br /> [/color][/center]",
