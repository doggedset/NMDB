  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds +10 unarmed damage, 1% health regen, and +50% run speed to the Ring of Hircine.  I made this mod because I use the werewolf toggle mod, making the Ring of Hircine completely useless.  Since I couldn\\'t find a mod that makes it a useful artifact, I made one.  I tried to pick buffs that fit in with werewolves.  Let me know if you have any suggestions\r\n\r\nBugs:  The description in active effects lists the speed enchantment twice, and doesnt list the health regen enchantment at all, despite all enchantments working properly through testing.
