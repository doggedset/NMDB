  "descriptionHtml": "Finally, a use for all those Blades of Sacrifice you collect while on the Boethiah quest!\r\n\r\nThis dagger is made using 1 Blade of Sacrifice and 2 human hearts, with Ebony Smithing. It is improved with 1 ebony ingot, with Arcane Blacksmith.\r\n\r\nBase damage is 12, and it is enchanted with a drain health enchantment.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nI lowered the damage for those who said it was too overpowered. I hope you like this better!\r\n\r\nThe images are still from the other version. Just so you know.",
