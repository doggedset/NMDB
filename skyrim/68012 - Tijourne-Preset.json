  "descriptionHtml": "This good looking guy named Tijourne is a handsome nord warrior, nothing special really, if you count out him being the dragon born and all. Also, I will repeat this, this is my first mod okay? I don&#39;t need a bunch of people complaining to me on this. Of course though, if asked, I will continue to make more of these guys. Or girls of course, no sexism here. Also, this mod requires only 2 things.
