Please watch my video i made for farther Instruction or you can just read it down below-\r\n\r\nThis Mods Make you jump 2x,5x,10x,20x,50x or 100x higher, depending on what you choose.\r\n\r\nRECOMMEND using 5x only, since its about close to the roof of a one story house! But you may choose which one you like! Will take fall damage if jump too high!\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nDownload this file MANUALLY and not with THE NMM, then extract only one of the choice into your skyrim\r\nData Folder and you\\'re done. To uninstall the mod just delete the file you chose to put in the data folder and replace it with another option.\r\n\r\nFor a tutorial on how to install please watch the video, in the video tab or copy and paste this link:\r\nhttp://youtu.be/bCohbEE_kGc",
