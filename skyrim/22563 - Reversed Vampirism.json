  "descriptionHtml": "I was disappointed with the vanilla implementation of vampirism. It seemed the only two useful stages were stage 1, and stage 4. \r\n\r\nAt stage 1 you had minimal strengths, and minimal weaknesses. Stage 4 was the opposite, and you gain some good powers, while being attacked by everyone. The later stage powers (Embrace Of Shadows and Vampire Seduction) are only really useful to infiltrate a town while in stage 4, so that you can return to stage 1. \r\n\r\nYou would end up having to choose between stage 1 and 4, and switching between the two is a pain. Either wait for 72 hours, or feed on someone. \r\n\r\nLong story short: Vanilla vampirism is a pain, has no clear objective, and actually gets in the way of playing the game. This mod is intended to make vampirism a viable play style with clear benefits and challenges.\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\nReversed Vampirism is designed to make vamprisim fun, challenging, and intuitive while changing little to make it seamless with vanilla Skyrim, with a couple small tweaks for immersion sake.
