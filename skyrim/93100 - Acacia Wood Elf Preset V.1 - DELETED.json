  "descriptionHtml": "Meet Acacia, a wood elf beauty from Valenwood, abandoned after her parents died when she was a child, she sought refuge in caves, killing with a sharpened rock. Until one day she decided to make for Skyrim, a land she only knew of from passing travelers...'a land of sweet rolls, mead and glory\", they called it. Shortly after leaving, she was captured by the Imperials, taken to Helgen, and before her very eyes a dragon appeared before her, and thankfully saved her life. \n<br />\n<br />Having been set free, Acacia deliberated leaving Skyrim but inside her she felt an unknown feeling...of purpose...could this not be a coincidence? \n<br />And thus began her journey...\n<br />\n<br />A skilled archer, Acacia uses destruction and illusion in combat against any enemy. \n<br />\n<br />Check Requirements for mods needed so your preset looks the same as mine!",
