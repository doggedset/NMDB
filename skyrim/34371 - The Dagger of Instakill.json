  "descriptionHtml": "There is a little known Daedra named Franz. Because he is to ashamed of his non fitting name he has never shown himself to a mortal being. When he heard of Mehrunes Razor he got jealous and planned to create a similar Dagger on his own, but with a much higher chance to instakill the target. When the Dagger was finished he dropped it from his Realm into Tamriel (Daggerfall :D) where it landed on the Talos Shrine in Whiterun (Heimskr is to busy blabbering nonsenes to notice).\r\n\r\nThis mod adds an retextured Glass Dagger that has a 100% chance to deliver an instant kill.\r\n\r\nThere is an additional Download with two Daggers looking like the Blade of Woe.\r\n\r\nI made it with the enchantment because if you just scale the damage up it looks horrible and you get a ridiculous increase of the Weapon skill. \r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\n- Bethesda for Skyrim and the Creation Kit\r\n- Franz for the Dagger of Instakill",
