  "descriptionHtml": "A very simple follower mod.\r<br />\r<br />Introduces four followers who have have taken refuge with a hunter and are located at the base of the trail leading from the guardian stones outside RiverWood.\r<br />\r<br />All followers are marked as essential, can duel wield, have only one perk (muffled movement), and level up as far as you can (unlimited level)\r<br />\r<br />The men are better with two handed, the girls better with one handed; other than that they are identical. Of course, the girls are still good with two handed, and the men are still good with one handed if you so choose.\r<br />\r<br />All followers use in-game follower mechanics and voices.\r<br />\r<br />__________________________________________________________________\r<br />Fluff n Stuff\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />1) Fazima the Red - (Female Khajiit) A young adventurer who seems eager to please, Fazima is always one to speak her mind, no matter who is listening. So far, her quick tongue hasn&#39;t gotten her into trouble ... yet.\r<br />\r<br />2) Franja Battle-Born - (Female Nord) Although she says she hails from a different clan from the Battle-Borns of Whiterun, Franja shows all the hot headedness and battle fury of any Nord. She wears her slightly marred beauty with pride.\r<br />\r<br />3) Do&#39;virr - (Male Khajiit) A kind and golden hearted warrior, Do&#39;virr is more likely to jump headlong into danger than to assess the situation properly. The blood of heroes flows strong in this cat, and it will no doubt kill him before long if he does not reign in his eagerness with experience.\r<br />\r<br />4) Turns-The-Clay - (Male Argonian) This lizard has kept his true name a secret from the others, which he says is solely for their protection. Although he has proven himself reliable and honest, the others are worried that his past may carry grave implication.\r<br />\r<br />__________________________________________________________________\r<br />\r<br />Ignore the &#34;core files&#34; folder; that is not necessary for installation, its just some jpegs and .npc files.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33; Thanks for downloading&#33; :)\r<br />\r<br />DaveEscape",
