  "descriptionHtml": "I am still loving Skyrim, but I have been absolutely disappointed with the pathetic looking daggers.  I\\'ve taken what I consider to be the four ugliest daggers \r\n\r\n-The blocky, transformer-looking Elven Dagger; The squiggly-poker-thingy called the Ebony Dagger; The simple, boring Mehrunes Razor which doesn\\'t even resemble daedric weaponry in the least; The big chunk of rock filed to look kind-of like a dagger-sword-thing called the Blade of Woe-\r\n\r\n and replaced them with my favorite dagger models of all time - Kit Rae and Gil Hibben Fantasy-Series Daggers!\r\n\r\nCheck out the screenies, and feel free to download and try them out!  Just drop the data folder in the Skyrim folder and merge the folders, as usual.\r\nThese are IMPORTED WEAPONS from ===COOLMAN\\'S DAGGER COLLECTION===, one of my favorite Oblivion Mods.  All credit for the meshes goes to HIM - the textures I have altered myself.  He finally got back to me and gave me permission to import these into Skyrim.  Enjoy!\r\n\r\n",
