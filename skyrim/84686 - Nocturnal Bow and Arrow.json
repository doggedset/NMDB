  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3][center][color=#ff0000]\r<br />This mod is OBSOLETE as being part of my new mod &#34;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/84871/?]The Art of Smithing[/url]&#34;.[/color][/center][/size]\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s a very simple mod allowing you to craft a replica of the Nightingale bow as well as assorted arrows.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]In Depth Description:[/b][/size]\r<br />The bow keeps the original model, though 50% thinner to make it more parctical. It is slightly more powerful than the Dragonbone Bow since I wanted to keep it until the end of the game. The arrows use the Daedric arrow and quiver meshes and textures. They are as strong as the Dragonbone arrows.\r<br />To keep it balanced, however, the crafting recipes will be available after the Trinity Restored quest, from the Thieves Guild. \r<br />Requires the Ebony Smithing perk to craft.\r<br />\r<br />As I cannot do anything about textures, I stuck with the vanilla textures pathway, so any texture mod you have on both original items will be used for this mod.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]Future plans:[/size][/b]\r<br />- Add a craftable Nightingale blade\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Known Issues: [/b][/size]\r<br />- As the meshes of the bow are quite thinner than the original, the Nightingale logo got a bit deformed. I can&#39;t do anything about that. \r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Special Thanks: [/b][/size]\r<br />- insaneplumber for allowing me to use his Nightingale bow meshes",
