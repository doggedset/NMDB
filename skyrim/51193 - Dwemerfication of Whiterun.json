  "descriptionHtml": "   This mod was inspired by the Industrialized Windhelm mod and born out of my frustration with Whiterun. I plan on doing much more with this but for now I am releasing what I have. I have played with this and found no conflicts. It does however require Dragonborn. I plan on updating interior cells and adding more to the city. This may be lore friendly, it depends....\r<br />\r<br />   After the civil war, the city stays in general disrepair. Well, no longer&#33; The Jarl has removed the damaged buildings and Farengar has begun several experiments, as well as piping in something from underground. \r<br />       Farengar&#39;s experiments continue. He has even started work in a secret lab underneath Whiterun in strange Dwemer ruins, pulsing with magical energy. However, he has gained the ire of Irileth after one of his experiments made it&#39;s way into her chambers. No one likes being awakened to tentacles....\r<br />        New with 1.5: Farengar and his assistants have moved the tentacles from the lab. They will be returning in the a few weeks. His assistants now have better schedules and the long tunnel has been removed. As a result, the navmesh in the passage is much better.",
