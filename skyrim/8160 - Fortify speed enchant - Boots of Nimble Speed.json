Thanks, Jim[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />BOOTS OF NIMBLE SPEED\r<br />Author: jimhsu\r<br />\r<br />-----------------------\r<br />\r<br />Dischantable boots with a custom Fortify Speed enchantment. Craftable at your nearest smither. Obviously, you could apply this enchantment to your armor as well...\r<br />\r<br />Magnitude is roughly comparable to a Resist Magic enchantment.\r<br />\r<br />This will affect all character speeds (walking, running, sprinting). \r<br />\r<br />Has not been tested for insanely high magnitudes (such as the ones obtainable with my Fortify Enchanting mod). Game crashing magnitudes should not be achievable in the vanilla game. Use common sense.\r<br />\r<br />PS Don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a similar mod out there already, but I didn&#39;t find a disenchantable one.",
