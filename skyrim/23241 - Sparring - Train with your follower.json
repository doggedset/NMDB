  "descriptionHtml": "PROBABLY WONT WORK WITH THE LATEST PATCH.\r<br />\r<br />This file contains two text files to be used ingame. This lets you spar with your followers to increase your skills.\r<br />\r<br />How to use: Extract the content to your Data folder. Ingame, make sure you and your follower are in a secluded place so no other npc&#39;s gets involved in the &#34;fight&#34;. Now, target your follower and type &#34;bat sparstart&#34; in the console then dismiss your follower. This will start the sparring. I made sure the player won&#39;t die during the progress.\r<br />\r<br />When you think you&#39;re done, just bring up the console and type &#34;bat sparstop&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I fully recommend using this with a mod that makes all the follower npc&#39;s essential.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If someone is to turn this to an actual .esp mod, please notify me and I will take this down. I&#39;d love to see my idea turned into something better. :)",
