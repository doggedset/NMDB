  "summary": "This is a mod that combines a bunch of Tropical skyrim mods into one Bsa and Esm master file. Making it easier to install and remove Tropical skyrim assets. Or even helping make modding with a Tropical theme easier!",
  "descriptionHtml": "These are all the files I combined into one Esp and A Bsa for the loose files. I then turned the Esp into a Master file to make it easier to make mods with a complete Tropical skyrim look and feel without a ton of loose files... Also makes installing the Tropical Overhaul easier and removal as simple as unclicking the Esm!! No more dual installs or worrying about a mod manager to install your mods for you... Also makes it more compatable with mesh and texture changes from other mods due to the lack of the loose meshes and textures within this one...\n<br />Every time you see this symbol = It means a mod that was added\n<br />\n<br />=Tropical Skyrim -- A Climate Overhaul\n<br />Created by Soolie\n<br />=No Floating Ice or Rocks for Tropical Skyrim\n<br />Created by unearthlycrowbar\n<br />=Tropical Skyrim - Elephants Instead of Mammoths\n<br />Created by GendunDrup\n<br />=Tropical Animals - Horse Replacers and Wild Zebra\n<br />Tropical Zebras - Replacers and Herds PROTECTED STALLIONS\n<br />Contains the replacers for the horses as well as wild zebras.
