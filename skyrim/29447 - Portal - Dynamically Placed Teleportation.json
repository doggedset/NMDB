  "descriptionHtml": "[youtube]0s-Vtha0GCQ#t=4m50s[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Very useful for dungeoneering, quick movement, or Mark and Recall (to get back to your player home from a dungeon, and step back into the exact point you left).\r<br />Also useful for getting out of sticky situations.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The spell is located on Farengar&#39;s desk along with a few other goodies.\r<br />\r<br />It works like portal, where you step into one and come out the other. No more complicated than that. (Though trust me, setting it up is more complicated than you would imagine.)\r<br />\r<br />It works within or between areas, so you can travel between a dungeon and home and back in a matter of seconds.\r<br />\r<br />I had this mod up before, but accidentally deleted it. If a mod can res the old version that would be great.",
