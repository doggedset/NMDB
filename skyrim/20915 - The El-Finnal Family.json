They are all for the player in Winterhold, the Frozen Hearth.\r\n\r\n\r\n-\tThe three followers are all connected as a family. Erudito is the elder, Malvadore is his son, and Ellyah is Malvadore’s Younger sister. They all have specialties that they can use.\r\n\r\n\r\n-\tErudito El-Finnal(63)\r\n?\tHe is a Two-Handed Greatsword Warrior. He will not other weapons but that. His level is set to 80, and he is very overpowered. Erudito is for Intense-Difficulty Dungeons or Mods. He can use Fire Breath shout and a dragonrend.\r\n\r\n-\tMalvadore El-Finnal(34)\r\n?\tHe is a Dual-Wielding Warrior. He will not use bows or greatswords. He is leveled along with the player. (Warning: Do not take Malvadore with Erudito If you’re using UFO mod. They don’t like each other.)\r\n\r\n-\tEllyah El-Finnal(33)\r\n?\tShe is an archer. She will not use Greatswords or One-handed Weapons at all. She can use a Frost Breath Shout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tInstallation\r\n-It is Fairly Simple, just drag all the files to the Data Folder. Just like any other mods. Oh, and there are Two ESP\\'s. Apply ONLY the one with shorter name. Applying them at the same time would cause crashes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tUsed Mods/Resources\r\n-Xenius Character Enhancement\r\nGeonox Face Textures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCURRENTLY UPLOADING IMAGES & File!",
