  "summary": "A simple texture/mesh replacement for a Farmer\\'s Hat to make the Warlock and Necromancer Hoods wearable from inventory.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A simple replacement for the Farmer\\'s hat. Warlock Hoods (Officially Black Mage Hoods in-game) don\\'t show up in the inventory, so you have to equip/unequip them via console. This mod replaces one of the farmer\\'s hats (The bandana-like one) with the hood model and texture. I personally have never seen a farmer wearing this hat, but perhaps you may come across a farmer looking decidedly Warlock-y. I think it\\'s worth it.\r\n\r\n[b]UPDATE:[/b] You may come across Hunters wearing these hoods. It kinda suits them though.\r\n\r\n[color=green]1.1[/color]: I tried to add the 5 monk hoods as textures, but it turns out that they just take the first version texture? Whatever the problem is, only the first one works, the rest default to the yellow texture. If someone could enlighten me as to how this should work, I\\'d be grateful.\r\n\r\n[color=green]NEW IN VERSION 1.1[/color]: Added new Monk hood, fixed Necromancer, now separate files.",
