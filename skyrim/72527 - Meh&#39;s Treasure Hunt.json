  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Georgia][size=4][color=#000000]A treasure hunt featuring 9 different locations, 4 new unique weapons, a story, and a lot of treasure. If[/color]\r<br />[color=#000000]you are looking for a treasure hunt mod where it’s not over in 20 minutes and[/color]\r<br />[color=#000000]you get more than just some gold and valuables, then you’re in the right place.[/color]\r<br />[color=#000000]While you do admittedly get some valuables, I’ve gone to more effort than that.[/color]\r<br />[color=#000000]You receive 4 new unique weapons, some new rare and valuable Honnigbrew Special[/color]\r<br />[color=#000000]Reserve Ale, and various other wonderful loot. The treasure hunt is mostly[/color]\r<br />[color=#000000]driven by notes that you pick up, although a few of them are in strongboxes, so[/color]\r<br />[color=#000000]be on the lookout for those, too. The first note is on the solitude docks. The[/color]\r<br />[color=#000000]others are scattered around all of Skyrim. Although Solstheim is mentioned,[/color]\r<br />[color=#000000]Dragonborn is not required. Also, if you just got a bottle of that new[/color]\r<br />[color=#000000]Honnigbrew Reserve and are wondering if there’s more of that: don’t worry there[/color]\r<br />[color=#000000]is. Later in the treasure hunt you get a few more bottles, but there also are[/color]\r<br />[color=#000000]two bottles at Honnigbrew meadery that respawn every now and then, and Sabjorn also[/color]\r<br />[color=#000000]sells it, but it is quite expensive.[/color][/size]\r<br />[size=3]\r<br />[/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Just install with NMM.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00]\r<br />Feedback is appreciated, but also please be gentle this is my first ever mod.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Have fun.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=1]\r<br />\r<br />There is a bonus sword hidden in this mod not mentioned in the description above. It is very powerful\r<br />and unique. This is the only hint you will get: urbi catadupa. If you manage to\r<br />find it you deserve it.\r<br />\r<br />Good luck&#33;[/size]",
