  "descriptionHtml": "We have to interact with wooden furiture too many times in game to leave that objects with ugly low-res textures\r\nI realized to make retex for those things cause vanilla ones are more than disgusting. I changed only poor furniture and didnt touch noble furniture.\r\n\r\nOnly problem is that there are too many objects refer to this texture, that are situated all over Skyrim and my color may not suit to someone\\'s  tastes in some places. its easy to use graphic program to change hue. so you can make it by yourlesves.\r\n\r\n\r\nTexture changes more than a half of wooden interior.It goes for beds, chairs, tables, shelves, boxes, wardrobe and even more but I dont know their English names cause Im Ukrainian. But the most important part is that tables and shelves with loot will not strike the eye any more. Added HD barrels for people who like to loot carrots.\r\n\r\nbarrels from 256x512 to 1024x2048\r\nfurniture from 512x512 to 2048x2048\r\n_________________________________________\r\nthanks to *Imrinfected* for great tutorial about normal mapping\r\nand to *Nywro* with *deanoman* for help and hints\r\nw/o them I wouldnt make normal maps for textures\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\ntry also my blacksmith workbench\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1688\r\n\r\n                                      [color=#4040FF][b][size=14]Installation[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\nmy modification changes only 8 files\r\n\r\ndownload and install main file and if you like some variations to this mod -\r\n- use optional files with overwriting main files\r\n\r\nunzip and pput folder named DATA to your Skyrim folder\r\n\r\nand merge all folders to suit like that  [b](for furniture)[/b]\r\nyour_Skyrim_address/data/textures/clutter/common/dresser01.dds\r\nyour_Skyrim_address/data/textures/clutter/common/dresser01_n.dds\r\nyour_Skyrim_address/data/textures/clutter/furniturewood01.dds\r\nyour_Skyrim_address/data/textures/clutter/furniturewood01_n.dds\r\n\r\nand like that                                         [b](for barrels)[/b]\r\nyour_Skyrim_address/data/textures/clutter/barrel01.dds\r\nyour_Skyrim_address/data/textures/clutter/barrel01_n.dds\r\nyour_Skyrim_address/data/textures/clutter/barrel02.dds\r\nyour_Skyrim_address/data/textures/clutter/barrel02_n.dds\r\n\r\n\r\nOPTIONAL\r\n\r\nAdded option with \r\n\r\nBARK  (bark on furniture only)\r\nBARK+CROSS (bark on furniture + cross on chairs)\r\nCROSS    (cross on chairs only)\r\n\r\n [color=#4040FF][b][size=8]choose what do you prefer and download one file from 4 available[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      bugs---none\r\nIt wont hurt anyone to try this out \r\ndidnt find FPS drops on my laptop\r\n--------------------------\r\n                                     compatibility\r\ncheck the screenshots.\r\nif you want to use some other mods that change the same objects look, then you should choose which one to use.\r\nwhat you will install the last - that will be in your game because installing same things will overwrite olready existing ones.\r\nyou can see what changes my \\\"mod\\\" by looking  above this words in installation description\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\ndont forget to return and endorse if you like it",
