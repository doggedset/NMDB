  "descriptionHtml": "Dwarven gear felt a bit bland to me, both armor & weapons, so I edited some of the textures to bring out the details.\r\nAlso I didn\\'t like how the helmet looked in 3rd person (especially from behind) so created a variant which is lore friendly (shaped like gears)\r\nMost of the weapons were slightly tweaked, some were already fine and left untouched (e.g. shield & arrows looked fine)\r\n\r\n[b]Install[/b]\r\nInstall using nexus mod manager.\r\n• [i]Helmet replacer, Vanilla craftable[/i] - new helmet is default, original helmet can be crafted\r\n• [i]Helmet Craftable only[/i] - new helmet is craftable only\r\n\r\n[b]History[/b]\r\n• [b]1.2, 29/9/2012[/b] - Enhanced Back armor pattern, fixed helmet proportions, vanilla helmet now points to right textures.\r\n• [b]1.1, 16/9/2012[/b] - Fixed missing meshes/textures in NMM.\r\n• [b]1.0, 16/9/2012[/b] - Initial release.\r\n\r\n[b]Why no female version ?[/b]\r\nTook me too long to make this mod, and also there\\'s already a [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2696]nice female dwarven armor here.[/url]\r\n\r\n[b]Can you make a helmet noface version ?[/b]\r\nSee above, also I actually play the game with helmet on 8 hotkey, and I use it to take it off around towns for immersion. :)\r\n",
