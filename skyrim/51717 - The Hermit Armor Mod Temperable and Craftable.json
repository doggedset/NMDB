  "descriptionHtml": "Basically Newermind43, made a great armor mod, which I love, however he didnt make the armor craftable or temperable. So basically what I did was made it craftable and temperable, as well as bump up the damage resistance of the cuirass a little bit, as well as remove the chest in skyhaven temple, which originally contained this armor, oh and I renamed it Nightwalker. \r<br />\r<br />HOW TO CRAFT?\r<br />\r<br />",
