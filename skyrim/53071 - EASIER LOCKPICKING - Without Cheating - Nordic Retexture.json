This gives more visual reference points to remember your lockpick placement. When a pick breaks, it&#39;s easier to find the spot you started from. It makes lockpicking easier, without really cheating... such as using a gradated lock measurement system.\r<br />\r<br />My concept with this texture mod was to make it easier to deal with expert and master locks without resorting to obvious (and lore-breaking) cheats. There is simply more wear and scratches on the outer lock surface to use as visual reference points.\r<br />\r<br />The textures are the default size, so anyone can use them, but I started with the hi-res files, so I packed as much detail as I could into the smaller size. My aim was to make a mod that anyone playing Skyrim on a PC could use.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Version 1.2 [/b] brings a new Nordic design flavor to the locks of Skyrim. Default locks were not exactly attractive, so I thought a face-lift was in order. Still has the same scratched surface to give visual reference points for easier lockpicking (without cheating). \r<br />\r<br />[b]Version 1.1[/b] is a cosmetic improvement to the interior cylinder of the lock (per request). No change to the outer ring.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33;[/size]",
