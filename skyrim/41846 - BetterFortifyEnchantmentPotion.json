To be used with the Fortify Restoration Potion Loop/Glitch.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-----Installing----------------------------------\r<br />Just download the mod and extract to wherever you want it, then put the esp file into the Data folder in your skyrim folder then make sure the box is already checked in the data menu of the skyrim launcher.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-----Using-------------------------------------\r<br />just use a OP Fortify enchantment potion that you made with the Fortify Restoration Loop/Glitch then it should work:)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />------Author&#39;s Notes-----------------------------\r<br />the whole reason i made this was because i was really pissed when i made SLIGHTLY OP items with the Fortify Restoration Loop/Glitch and i had to keep those items on AT ALL TIMES\r<br />or else i wouldn&#39;t get the awesome enchantment, this fixes that.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />---------Compatibility--------------------------\r<br />doesn&#39;t work with anything that changes the potion like an overhaul.\r<br /> it doesn&#39;t quite work with SKSE, but you can just turn off SKSE, use the mod without SKSE\r<br />then enchant your stuff then turn SKSE back on.\r<br />EDIT: i just found out something, if you have a problem where the potion gets caped at a certain %\r<br />then you need to get this mod http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34302 that should fix it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />---------Troubleshoot--------------------------\r<br />If you have any problems or questions then please email me at codmaniac89@gmail.com.",
