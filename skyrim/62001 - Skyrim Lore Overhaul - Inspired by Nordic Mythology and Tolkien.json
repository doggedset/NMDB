  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=6][color=#b4a7d6][b]Skyrim Lore Overhaul [/b]\r<br />Inspired by Nordic Mythology and Tolkien[/color][size=3]\r<br />[/size][/size][size=3]Those of you who have read (one of) the books written by Tolkien might have \r<br />noticed the enormous similarity between his work and Skyrim. It \r<br />therefore is not hard to change (some) things of Skyrim into \r<br />Middle-Earth inspired lore. (if it wasn&#39;t that already)[/size][size=3]\r<br />\r<br />Due to the large amount of comments about copyright on my Tolkien mod (and yes, you are right \r<br />about it) I have changed the names to resemble Nordic mythology, and \r<br />have drawn on the work of Tolkien for inspiration. This since Nordic \r<br />mythology is a large source for both Tolkien and Skyrim, and the authors\r<br /> of this mythology are either long dead, or unknown.\r<br />[/size][size=3]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=5][u][b]_     What I have changed so far[/b][/u][u]     _\r<br />[/u][/size][size=4]The loading screens:\r<br />[/size][size=3]I have changed the text on many of the loading-screens. On some of them, I just changed the name &#39;Skyrrim&#39; into &#39;Midgard&#39;, on others I have changed all of the text. Most of them just stayed the same. I can&#39;t list all of them here, so you have to see them in-game ;)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]The races:[/size]\r<br />[size=3]Although I have given the vanilla names, the only things that stayed the same is\r<br /> the appearance of them. I changed the name, the description and the \r<br />attributes, including the special powers each race has. I didn&#39;t alter \r<br />them, I just rearranged them and most of the time made new combinations.\r<br /> The former Breton for example has the resistance against poison and \r<br />disease from the Wood Elf and the Adrenaline Rush from the Redguard. \r<br />The races that are not included here are unchanged.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Man of the North (Imperial)[/size]\r<br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/62001-1-1422212677.png[/img]\r<br />[size=3]Man of the West (Nord)[/size]\r<br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/62001-2-1422212677.png[/img]\r<br />[size=3]Man of the East (Redguard)[/size]\r<br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/62001-5-1422212770.png[/img]\r<br />[size=3]Corsair (Breton)[/size]\r<br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/62001-1-1422212770.png[/img]\r<br />[size=3]Dwarf (Dark Elf)\r<br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/62001-2-1422212770.png[/img]\r<br />Elf (Wood Elf)\r<br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/62001-3-1422212770.png[/img]\r<br />Light Elf (High Elf)\r<br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/62001-4-1422212770.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][u][b]_     What is going to change[/b][/u][u]     _[/u][/size]\r<br />The names of the divines\r<br />The loading screens mentioning lore, playable races or divines\r<br />The books mentioning lore, playable races or divines (will take a lot of time, so have to wait for some holidays)\r<br />[size=3]The dialogue mentioning lore, playable races or divines (will take a lot of time, so have to wait for some holidays)\r<br />[/size]The whole Civil-War questline is going to be way more epic.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][size=5][u][b]_     What is (probably) not going to change[/b][/u][u]     _[/u][/size]\r<br />The names of the holds and characters\r<br />The spoken dialogue (I can only change the subtitles, unless there is someone who wants to do the voice-acting)\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=5][u][b]_     Compatibility[/b][/u][u]     _[/u][/size]\r<br />[size=3]I can&#39;t check the complete compatibility with every mod, but I can list the things this one changes.\r<br />[/size]The description of the races\r<br />the base-stats of the races, and their powers\r<br />the text on the loading-screens\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][size=5][u][b]_     Extra Info[/b][/u][u]     _[/u][/size]\r<br />Since many people dislike my choises, and no-one would be able to make the lore fit to everyone, I made a video of 15 minutes on how you can change the lore yourself.\r<br /> It is easy to do, but it will take some time, depending on how much you want to change.\r<br />[youtube]ENShP15D5AA[/youtube]\r<br />[/size]You can now also find me on facebook, for the latest updates on this mod for example:\r<br />https://www.facebook.com/ErianDragonborn[/center]",
