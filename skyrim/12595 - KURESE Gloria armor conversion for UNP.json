  "descriptionHtml": "KURESE Gloria armor conversion for UNP Main body\r\nby dimon99\r\n====================================================================\r\nATTENTION: This is the SAME file,previously found in \\\"DIMONIZED UNP \r\nclothing resources\\\". If you already got it from there-no need to download \r\nit from here.No changes were made at all.\r\n  As much as I hate to have another mod page-this is a proper way IMO,since\r\nGloria is not exactly a \\\"DIMONIZED clothing resource\\\",hehe, and does not \r\nneed \\\"adult\\\" flag. \r\nATTENTION FOR MODDERS:  I understand that my ESP is not all that good, making outfit craftable,upgradeable ect -would be a good thing. I,personally, do not have time for this,unfortunately.  Go ahead and improve it.  You can either up new ESP here -I will give access to you for mod page, or release it as standalone upgrade ESP.  Either way is fine.\r\n====================================================================\r\nThis is a conversion of one of my favorite Oblivion outfits,\r\ncreated by probably my most favorite outfitter (along with Hentai) - \r\nNPR/KURESE. \r\n  My first ever conversion for FO3 was from the same mod - but it was \r\nTrish. Now it\\'s Gloria time. Outfit is VERY complex and insanely hard to \r\nrefit. Anyone,who knows a bit about modelling will see it right away, just \r\nlooking at it in Nifskope. However, I could pull it off, was damn hard,but \r\nin the end,it worth it for me. This one my girls gonna wear - not stash in \r\nthe chest :)  I gave it AR of dragonscale,no idea if it enchants or \r\nupgrades -but I used Daedric template. I simply do not have time for CK \r\nfiddling. With craftable and all that.Maybe it is craftable -hell knows :)\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\nGetting in the game:  \r\nCurrently only thru console.\r\nType help Gloria 4 to get the codes.\r\nType player.additem {code} {number of items you want}\r\nPage up Page down for scrolling those codes.\r\nArrow up arrow down for scrolling lines you inputed - so you don\\'t have to \r\nretype whole line again. \r\nGoogle about general console usage/tutorial\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nInstall: \r\nUnzip> drop contents into Data folder. Or use NMM, should work.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nNOTES and ISSUES:\r\nI recommend to use ONLY KURESE Gloria FULL/FULL Black outfits.\r\nThose provide the best performanse,least clipping and simply are the way it \r\nwas designed by KURESE.\r\n  Split parts are for advanced users ONLY, who know the drill -there WILL \r\nbe clipping and stuff. \r\nThere are no gloves, I had to cut Oblivion hands part,obviously. \r\nWhite Gloria can be overly shiny under the sun, I\\'d prefer to keep things \r\noriginal tho. Black one is a WIN,damn good :)\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCredits:\r\n NPR/KURESE - EVERYTHING. LOL :) Original mod:\r\nGloria and Trish Armor for HGEC by NPR\r\nhttp://tes.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=20125 \r\nUsed with permission (3 years old one,hehe) \r\nContact the author for any usage permits.\r\nbison1967 - the title image.
