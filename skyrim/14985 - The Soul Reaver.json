  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE New Years 2013\r\nI\\'ve completely redone the model and made a far-better mod for the Soul Reaver here:\r\n(http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29168)\r\nHowever I\\'m keeping this version up just for the guy with a really-low-end PC that might not like the new version\\'s high definition.\r\n\r\nUPDATE April 12/2012\r\nRather than force everyone to conform to my own inaccurate preferences, I\\'ve made 3 more versions of the Reaver for everyone\\'s enjoyment. You can now choose between a Two or One handed blade, and whether the skull faces Inwards or Out. \r\n\r\nIf you experience problems, be sure to comment and let me know, I\\'ll be trying to check every day or so. Though first of all, do try putting the .esp file at the end of your load order.\r\n\r\nThis mod implements my own Soul Reaver model into the game as a one-handed sword. No meshes or textures were used from any other game, everything has been made from scratch.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\nJust install with the Nexus Mod Manager or drag the Data folder to your Skyrim folder and activate the Soulreaver.esp.\r\n\r\nLOCATION\r\n\r\nSeek out the Soul Reaver inside a cursed chamber near Markarth.\r\n\r\nI had originally designed a lengthy dungeon with puzzles and bosses that were more than just health sponges. Unfortunately the Creation Kit\\'s frequent and nonsensical crashes and data corruption drove me up the wall and prevented me from doing any more than dropping it into a small room.\r\n\r\nI would make a two-handed version of the reaver myself, but I have many other encroaching projects and university work that will be keeping me busy. Anyone who\\'s so inclined can mess with the model however they want as long as they drop a link to this download.",
