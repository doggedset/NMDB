  "descriptionHtml": "Graffiti: Tag Anything&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Installation: Simply extract all contents into your Data folder. Allow folders to merge\r<br />as the computer requests.\r<br />\r<br />What this mod does is allow you to &#34;spraypaint&#34; a given picture on a wall (but not floors\r<br />or ceilings unfortunately).\r<br />\r<br />The default picture is of the dragonborn symbol, but you can change it to whatever you like.\r<br />\r<br />Finding the Spell:\r<br />When facing the arcane enchanter in Farengar&#39;s (the court wizard of Whiterun in Dragonsreach)\r<br />office there are doors to your left and right. Go through the one to your left and turn.\r<br />There is a small table there with the tome.\r<br />\r<br />Using the spell:\r<br />It is basically point and click. It doesn&#39;t work on ceilings and floors, but works on all walls.\r<br />However, it is best to find a large flat wall, as if the projectile hits an oddly angled\r<br />surface, the results are...less than optimal.\r<br />\r<br />Only one tag can be placed at any time. This is for two reasons. Firstly, it prevents save bloat\r<br />and secondly you can&#39;t actually &#34;spawn&#34; decals, you can only move them around. So, for now\r<br />there is only one at a time. I may fix this, depends on if it is possible to fix or not.\r<br />\r<br />Changing the picture:\r<br />In your Skyrim/Data/textures/Graffiti folder there are two files, myGraffiti.dds, and myGraffiti_n.dds\r<br />With Gimp and the .dds extender you can take any picture you want, export it as a .dds\r<br />named myGraffiti.dds and move the picture into the aforementioned folder and replace the\r<br />existing file. Voila&#33; For best results make the picture 512x512 pixels and also make a normal map.\r<br />\r<br />Making a normal map:\r<br />http://custommapmakers.net/index.php?option=com_kunena&func=view&catid=18&id=1715&Itemid=54\r<br />\r<br />The instuctions look complicated, but its really very easy.\r<br />\r<br />Please show us your art and upload a picture to this page&#33; (No adult content please)",
