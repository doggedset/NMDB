  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Description[/b]\r<br />Just a simple solution for people who get a missing texture on the armored wolf&#39;s leg wraps from the Armored SabreCat Mount mod made by the great tumbajamba before he retired from modding to focus on his family because he is awesome, I made this since I noticed even MMOXReview was having the issue. You still need the original mod located here [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8978/?]Armored SabreCat Mount [/url] which I highly recommend despite its armored wolf&#39;s incompletion. Be sure to endorse his mod, and don&#39;t worry, there are no scripts or plugins with my fix, so it&#39;s 100% safe.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation[/b]\r<br />Nexus Mod Manager / NMM installation: Just click the green download button and install like any other mod and overwrite the files when asked.\r<br />Manual installation: To install manually extract the archive to the game directory and overwrite the files when asked.\r<br />Mod Organizer installation: I don&#39;t remember but just download and double click the download when complete and ignore what seems to be a conflict, it isn&#39;t, it&#39;s suppose to override that mesh. Also, check the box next to the mod&#39;s name in your list of mods if it isn&#39;t already.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Required Mods[/b]: Only TumbaJamba&#39;s [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8978/?]Armored SabreCat Mount [/url]﻿ of course, install that mod first and then mine if you haven&#39;t already.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Irrelevant[/b]\r<br />If you have the ability to or know someone who does, please, take note that his mod is now a modder&#39;s resource and, please, fix the remaining issues with that nearly completed mod, this armored wolf in particular ... which I personally call Fenrir, here are some of the issues listed on the forum post ﻿[url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/2009219-finish-armored-wolf-from-armored-sabre-cat-mount/]http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/2009219-finish-armored-wolf-from-armored-sabre-cat-mount/\r<br />\r<br />[/url]Credit&#39;s: TumbaJamba",
