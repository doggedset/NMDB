  "descriptionHtml": "This is an intentionally ugly, useless, and generally strange npc that you would probably want to get rid of as soon as possible. \r<br />\r<br />Its intended purpose is to be sacrificed at the Shrine of Boethia for the &#34;Boethia&#39;s Calling&#34; quest so that you don&#39;t have to give up one of the legitimately useful followers. \r<br />\r<br />It resides in Candlehearth Hall in Windhelm and you can recruit it from the beginning. \r<br />\r<br />If you&#39;re wondering why I&#39;m referring to the follower as &#34;it&#34; and not &#34;he&#34; or &#34;she&#34;... well... if you install it you&#39;ll understand... \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />P.S. This mod is mostly for me, I&#39;m aware that there are probably mods similar to this one, but I&#39;m too lazy to look for one.\r<br />\r<br />P.P.S. Yay first upload",
