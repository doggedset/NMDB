  "descriptionHtml": "This mod changes the weight and damage of axes and pickaxes to a more realistic level. I myself own a REAL axe and pickaxe. They do not weigh ten pounds. They weigh around five pounds. Now I do not know if the units of measurement TES uses are pounds, kilos or whatever, but I am going to go ahead and assume that TES uses pounds and not some odd Tamreilic scale.\r\n\r\nI also changed the base damage of both the axe and pickaxe to 15 from 5. THIS IS OPTIONAL! I included two .esps for a reason.\r\n\r\nAlso! This mod doesn\\'t seem to work with the mod \\\"Skyrim Redone\\\" or SKYRE. IT doesn\\'t make anything crash, but the SKYRE mod just overlaps the effects of this mod, rendering it useless.",
