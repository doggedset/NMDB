  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5][color=#980000]No DLC Required\r<br />No Scripts\r<br />No animations\r<br />\r<br />[/color][/size][color=#8e7cc3][size=3]Just a simple potion mod that adds some spice to your characters appearance, and a way to use destructive spells on Horseback.\r<br />I tried Horsemen by Rongphale, it was nice and worked for a bit, but I have Convenient Horses, and it was still glitches.\r<br />So I stumbled upon this (BY LUCK) that by use of a potion I was able to acquire the Bound Bow. So I simply adjusted the Projectiles to become Fire, Frost, and Shock elements and it worked, even on horseback.\r<br />\r<br />Since I had already began working on a potions mod here, I thought it would be a great addition to it. This is still in early stages, so bear with me. But you may like the Specter and Philter of Phantom potions as a cosmetic source for your character.\r<br />\r<br />There still some things to check, like the projectiles still utilize the destruction tree perk, and so forth.\r<br />There is Philter of Phantom\r<br />Philter of Phantom (Violet)\r<br />Effect Restore - For the Specter and Phantom, after the Duration your character will be slightly invisible, this will fix it.\r<br />Ebony/Stone/ and Oak Flesh - just like the spell, but potion form, great for Horseback.\r<br />Fire/ Frost/ Storm Specters - Just like Phantoms but give off a unique illusion\r<br />Clairevoyance - Works but not very resourceful, especially on horseback\r<br />Ebony Cloak - Similar as the Boethia ebony Cuirass, but no armor required\r<br />Candlelight - Potion form great for Horseback.\r<br />\r<br />These Potions use new ingredients, and can only be obtained through Cooking other ingredients. No to hard to acquire but still enough to make you go searching.\r<br />[color=#980000][size=6]File 1[/size][/color] is the main mod, nothing in the CK was altered except Shrouded HearthBarrow where Wyndelis is located. A new chest with ingredients in it, and a cooking pot.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#980000][size=6]File 2[color=#8e7cc3][size=3] is the same but I altered all cooking pots to use the Alchemy Skill.[/size][/color][/size][/color]\r<br />[/size][/color]",
