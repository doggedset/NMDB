  "descriptionHtml": "I thought I\\'d do something practical on my first foray into Skyrim modding.  Hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\nThis plugin modifies the \\'Thalmor Robes\\' and \\'Hooded Thalmor Robes\\' items found in the game to not have an enchantment by default, allowing the player to enchant them, themselves.  So go find a Thalmor sorcerer and steal his clothes!\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re having trouble finding them in-game, an easy place to get a set are from a dead Thalmor located at a shrine just north of Helgen and east of Riverwood, near where you start the game.",
