  "descriptionHtml": "My first publicly released mod, it was requested by eatfist while I was working on some larger projects so here it is. It&#39;s a pretty simple mod that adds in a new standalone set of armor. The new armor can be found under the hide category and is mostly intended for use at higher levels. It uses the savior&#39;s hide armor, as well as forsworn boots and a retextured version of the forsworn bracers and stormcloak bear hat. Currently only supports male men and elves. Yes you can temper it as well&#33; All done with vanilla meshes and textures. Credit for the screenshots goes to eatfist as well.Â ",
