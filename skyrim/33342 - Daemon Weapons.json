  "descriptionHtml": "Chaos has begun to seep into Tamriel and it\\'s relics have begun to apear. Although these mighty weapons offer their bearers unimaginable power, they also usher in Chaos and thus the end of the world...\r\n\r\nThis mod currently adds two weapons within the Bloodlet Throne, they are both sitting on the same table.\r\n\r\nAxe of Blind Fury:\r\n\r\nAn axe with a very high speed, i am working on making it lower your skill for one handed while you are wearing it (as the fluff i\\'m basing it on says, when you weild theaxe the daemon inside makes you go mental so you hit harder and faster but with less skill and accuracy).\r\n\r\nThe Black Mace:\r\n\r\nIt bassically does what Saurons mace does in LOTR. Also has a chance at insta killing.\r\n\r\nI intend to add more Daemon Weapons and will work on custom meshes and textures when I can.",
