  "descriptionHtml": "A mod that restores the rarity and constant utility of unique artifacts found in previous Elder Scrolls games by greatly increasing their gold value, de-leveling them, and restoring enchatments from previous games. No longer is it just daedric junk that you sell for a pocketful or gold nor a weak weapon you could easily replace with your own custom enchanted weapon. \r\n\r\nQuestions I Estimate Will Be Asked\r\n\r\nQ: Why are some artifacts that had a lower price in Oblivion so high in this mod? \r\nA: I take Morrowind as my pricing guide for all artifacts, since the devaluing of artifacts started in Oblivion. I take a rough medium between high priced and low priced artifacts from Morrowind to price returning Oblivon and Daggerfall artifacts. \r\nQ: Why are some of the items like Bloodskal (Dragonborn) and Hircines Ring so inexpensive? \r\nA: Because that was their price in Morrowind, I estimate Hircines was because the ring itself is cursed and only for werewolves. Bloodskal on the other hand was a very different and arguably less powerful weapon in Bloodmoon.\r\nQ: Aren\\'t these a little overpowered?\r\nA: Thats the fun in it, that what made something special about finding an artifact in Morrowind :-DDD. I made this mod with my Encounter Zone Deleveled Skyrim in mind. \r\n\r\nCredit to Hanabi for Keening\\'s passive script",
