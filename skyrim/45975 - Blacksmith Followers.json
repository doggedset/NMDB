  "summary": "A mod which allows the blacksmiths of Skyrim to continue selling and buying goods from anywhere once they&#39;ve become a follower. *WIP*",
  "descriptionHtml": "Credit to [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/7935072]Overkill55[/url] for the request/idea.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: do not download this mod for use in game. This is available as a jumping off point for someone else who thinks they can make it work.\r<br />\r<br />Requested mod: It currently has some major bugs which I can&#39;t figure out when I&#39;m this tired. Namely, everything works perfectly fine... sometimes... and for some people. It doesn&#39;t work the rest of the time or for other people. Don&#39;t get this just yet. But if it appeals to you, I should have a working version up within a day or two (possibly sooner). If you think you can fix it, then go [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/1188613-in-search-of-blacksmith-follower/]here[/url] to see what&#39;s wrong with it. If you fix it, then upload it, let me know, give me some credit (please?) and I&#39;ll just remove this one. Or I&#39;ll replace this with yours and give you credit. Whatever works for you.\r<br />\r<br />What it actually does: This mod adds a faction to each vanilla Blacksmith merchant. The new factions makes it so if that blacksmith is a follower, then they&#39;ll offer their services anytime, anywhere. The point is so that if you make a blacksmith a follower, then you can trade with them wherever they go.",
