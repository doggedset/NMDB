  "descriptionHtml": "[size=40][color=white][b]Dwarven Leather[/b][/color][/size]\r\n[b]Because all that darn metal is way too heavy![/b]\r\n\r\n===========================================================\r\nDescription\r\n=======================================================\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nSo here I was playing skyrim, when suddenly I felt the need to retexture the dwarven armor my character was wearing. I always loved the dwarven armor, but a lot of the great detail of it goes to waste because of its bland, contrastless look. So I decided to replace a whole bunch of the metal plating with a leathery texture, to break things up a bit. This is the result!\r\n\r\n[b]If you enjoy the mod, please leave a comment, endorse, and/or do a happy dance.[/b]\r\n\r\n===========================================================\r\nRequirements\r\n=======================================================\r\n-none, except a pc that can run skyrim I suppose. I\\'ve kept the same resolution, so there should be no performance issues at all. And since its just a retexture, no esp file is needed. \r\nIf you for some reason are having trouble tho, please leave a comment on the discussions page!\r\n\r\n===========================================================\r\nInstallation\r\n=======================================================\r\nYou\\'re probably best off using the Nexus mod manager, but if you don\\'t like that, a manual install goes like this:\r\n- Download the DwarvenLeather.rar archive from the downloads page\r\n- After that, open the  archive using winrar, or any other archiver that can open .rar files\r\n- In the archiver, extract the file to your skyrim folder. The folder named \\\"data\\\" should now merge with the data folder in your skyrim folder. \r\n\r\n===========================================================\r\nPossible future plans\r\n=======================================================\r\n- Make a light armor standalone using this texture.\r\n- Add shield, and perhaps weapon textures.\r\n- Any suggestions?\r\n\r\n===========================================================\r\nDisclaimer\r\n=======================================================\r\nI do NOT give permission for this to be uploaded anywhere.\r\nIf you wish to use my textures for some other mod, please ask me for permission first. In case I do not reply, the answer is always no.",
