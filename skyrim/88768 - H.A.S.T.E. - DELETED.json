  "summary": "Just a few tweaks to gameplay.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is just a collection of my 'common sense' Tweaks as was requested by user Esareph on Bethesda.net. This mod, so far, changes the following:\n<br />\n<br />[list][*]Crime radius cut from 4000 to 800. Now guards all the way in Windhelm will no longer be able to see you steal that coin purse from Camilla in Riverwood.\n<br />[*]Animals no longer report crimes.\n<br />[*]Removes Skyrim sidestep\n<br />[*]Illusion spells are non-hostile. Because why would someone know if you're using Illusion magic?\n<br />[*]Distance enemies can chase or detect you has been cut from 2500 to 1250. So now no more messages saying \"You can't do that while in combat\" all because a mudcrab saw you 5 minutes ago.\n<br />[*]Bounty Quests now give you real rewads for risking your life:\n<br />\n<br />     Bandits are worth 210 Gold\n<br />     Forsworn are worth 250 Gold\n<br />     Giants are worth 850 Gold\n<br />     Dragons are worth 2100 Gold\n<br />\n<br />[*]Torches have a larger area of illuminationm\n<br />[*]Fall damage is slighly less because of shoddy NavMeshing by Bethesda.\n<br />[*]The Player and all NPCs now blink (Player still cannot blink in 1st person mode).\n<br />[*]NPCs will no longer randomly greet you. They will still chatter to each other. Enemies still taunt.[/list]\n<br />\n<br />I DID NOT MAKE EVERY MOD IN THE WORLD AND AS SUCH AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR INCOMPATABILITIES FROM OTHER MODS. ALL MODS MADE BY ME ARE TESTED TOGETHER AND WORK AS INTENDED. IF YOU HAVE AN ISSUE IT IS ON YOUR END. I WILL ALSO NOT MAKE A NEW VERSION JUST FOR YOU. I MAKE MODS FOR MY GAME NOT YOURS.",
