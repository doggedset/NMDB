  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Trebuchet MS][color=#00ffff][size=6]Kursan presents: Delux ArchMage Quarters plus Mages Kitchen\r<br />                                 \r<br />                                     [img]http://i.imgur.com/VFlvwAI.png[/img]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[/color][/font]\r<br />[font=Trebuchet MS][color=#1e84cc][size=3]The ArchMages Quarters at the College of Winterhold always felt very cold and unwelcoming to me.\r<br />There are already other mods that change them quite a bit, this is my interpretation of a more luxurious suite for the head of an illustrious order without going overboard.[/size][/color][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff00ff]Changelog: New in V-1.3\r<br />Added two Mannequins by request to the entry lobby.\r<br />Added ample Ingredient storage directly to the Alchemy lab.\r<br />Added storage for Soul gems and enchanted gear by the Enchanter table.\r<br />Added two wall mounted weapon plaques for shield and two weapons each.\r<br />Added some decor and moved stuff around. \r<br />Removed more unnecessary clutter.\r<br />The new bed has no ownership so you can sleep in it even before becoming Archmage.\r<br /> \r<br />The following features are still the same from the original version:\r<br />Two fire places, one for cooking and one for decor and heat by the bed.\r<br />Changed the bed location and to a different style.\r<br />Added 3 library type Bookcases filling a niche, one is empty, plus one open bookshelf near the bed.\r<br />Added 9 standing weapon racks perfect for staffs.\r<br />Added an ornate bathtub with heat source.\r<br />Added some drapes and wall decorations and many floor rugs and skins.\r<br />Added one more small display case for balance.\r<br />Moved existing furnishings around to fit in better and removed some unnecessary clutter.\r<br />[/color][color=#ffff00][size=3]\r<br />This Mod includes my previous mod &#34;Mages Kitchen&#34; which adds a full kitchen to the hall of Attainment. You can get the kitchen by itself on its own page here:[/size][/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30570/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30570/?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00][size=3]I Hope you will like this mod and endorse it. The Bathtub is particularly useful if you use both Frostfall by Chesko and &#34;Drink Eat Sleep and Bathe&#34; by RyanB, that way you can actually clean up in the tub and also get warmed up; particularly useful in that region:)\r<br />If you are using a mod that changes the water textures be sure to load this after it so that the water in the tub is recognized by &#34;Drink Eat Sleep and Bathe&#34; for the bathing function to work and that mod needs to load after a water texture mod also.\r<br />\r<br />The mod has been cleaned with TES5Edit, but always make a backup save before trying a new mod, this one is no different and I am not liable for any issues you may have after trying out this mod.\r<br />I like to thank Bethesda for a truly one of a kind game.\r<br />Special credit goes to Eldiabs for his Modders Resource pack. \r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />Best to use the NMM button and activate in your load order; or for manual installation just drop the esp file into your Skyrim Data folder and make sure its box is ticked in your Load order menu.[/size][/color]",
