  "summary": "Adds Iron Patriot as a follower outside Riverwood with a spare set of armor.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a unique follower to Skyrim, based on the Marvel character, James Rhodes, Iron Patriot. \r<br />\r<br />This is for Male Only. \r<br />\r<br />You&#39;ll find him outside Riverwood. He will level with the player and is a destruction mage using all three elements and has his own perks. \r<br />\r<br />Furthermore, it adds an second set of armor. \r<br />\r<br />*************************************************** \r<br />The Armour: \r<br />Based around the Nordic Carved retextured with the red, blue and silver scheme of Iron Patriot. It&#39;s unenchanted, and can only be crafted under the Nordic Carved section of the Sky Forge, and tempered as usual at the workbench. Stat-wise it&#39;s a little stronger than Nordic Carved. \r<br />Note the set is standalone, and not a replacer of the Nordic armour. Although it&#39;s based on the iconic Iron Patriot suit of Marvel, i&#39;ve attempted to make it look more armor based, more in keeping with Skyrim. It&#39;s about as lore-friendly as you can get. \r<br />Ive made made 2 helmets depending what you like, 1 is a heavy dawnguard helmet and the other is the stark helmet. \r<br />\r<br />************************************************** \r<br />Compatibility & Troubleshooting \r<br />This mod reqiures Dragonborn and Dawnguard DLC&#39;s. \r<br />\r<br />The armour should not conflict with anything else. \r<br />************************************************** \r<br />Credits \r<br />Big thanks to Veneraz for providing the meshe for the Stark Hlemet. \r<br />\r<br />************************************************** \r<br />Installation: \r<br />Simply extract the archive into the Skyrim folder, so the .esp, textures folder, and meshes folder all land into your skyrim/data directory. \r<br />Typically: \r<br />C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim \r<br />\r<br />C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim ",
