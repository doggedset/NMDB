  "descriptionHtml": "This is a very simple mod that replaces one of the vanilla death screams with the famous &#34;Wilhelm scream&#34; from various Hollywood movies. \r<br />\r<br />The Wilhelm Scream happens when an NPC dies, about 20% of the time. So one in every five deaths basically. I fixed the volume level and moved it to a 3D sound space, which is a fancy way of saying the Wilhelm will come from the direction the NPC died in, instead of sounding like it&#39;s inside your head. \r<br />\r<br />Also note, the scream has a random chance to happen when you die too. It&#39;s definitely good for a chuckle in an otherwise frustrating moment. Enjoy. ",
