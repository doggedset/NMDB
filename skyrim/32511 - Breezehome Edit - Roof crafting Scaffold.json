  "descriptionHtml": "V.1.00\r\nThis is a rather simple mod that adds a roof scaffold to Breezehome. The scaffold can be accessed VIA trapdoor in the bedroom. The mod includes clutters, scenic views, An anvil (Doubles up as a forge, just more space efficient), Workbench, Grindstone, chest and storage tent (Located behind the building)\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n1. Extract files to a separate folder\r\n2. Copy then paste into data folder\r\n3. Change load order in data files so that Breezehome roof scaffold.esp is above Stair fix.esp (Yes... The stairs were out to get me today.)\r\n4. Hit play and enjoy! (:\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n-Somehow, someway, the door was messed up. Somehow it was knocked off it\\'s hinges and now sits idle. If you have anything to help me with the problem please feel free to suggest. As I have already tried to edit it VIA creation kit.\r\n\r\nSide notes:\r\n-Take into account I am very new at modding and I honestly love doing this. If I could find someone to teach me more I would be absolutely grateful and I would love you (Bake you cookies). So please message if you want to help me or not (: -Thanks you",
