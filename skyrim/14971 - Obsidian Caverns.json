  "descriptionHtml": "[b]\r<br />\r<br />Notes from the Author[/b]\r<br />\r<br />So obviously I have issues with updating things, I have been putting off releasing this mod for a while. I want to say I will work on it soon but I can&#39;t make promises, as before I&#39;m not good at keeping them. I will try though.\r<br />\r<br />[s]Update: As of April 20th, I have started working on the 2nd and 3rd caverns, hopefully I will have them released in the next 2 weeks depending on how my process goes.[/s] There will be a lot of changes to the first cavern also that will make it just as hard for a level 1 (if they&#39;ve made it there) as it is for a level 80 or higher than that even. Hopefully if it all goes according to plan, It will change the entire way dungeons are played.\r<br />\r<br />Well from Onyx Cavern to Obsidian Caverns, this is the revamped and larger cavern in comparison to my Onyx Cavern mod. Happy to finally release it and hope to hear some feedback with suggestions and ideas.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Possible Bugs[/b]\r<br />- Possible CTD when travelling into Riverwood area\r<br />- Followers may not follow you into the caves (Should be fixed?)\r<br />- Experienced a weird error when pressing 2 while in the cavern to hotkey switch to another item I would be teleported instantly back to the cavern cave entrance. If anyone else has this bug, please let me know so I can get a deeper understanding at what is causing it.\r<br />- Character slightly freezes when equipping a torch from the caves (Could possibly a conflict with Torches Cast Shadows mod, will look into it)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Version[/b]\r<br />[b]1.1[/b]\r<br />- Moved entrance further away so there is no &#34;To Skyrim&#34; text\r<br />- Replaced some creatures\r<br />- Most Bandits are leveled\r<br />- Followers should follow you through the cave\r<br />\r<br />[b]1.0[/b]\r<br />- Initial Release\r<br />\r<br />[b]Credits[/b]\r<br />McclaudEagle for creating the navmesh manually after many failed auto-generated ones.",
