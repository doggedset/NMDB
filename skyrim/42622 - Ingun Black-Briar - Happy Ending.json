  "descriptionHtml": "My third mod in the Happy Ending series, this one adds an immersive way to marry Ingun Black-Briar in Riften and is filled with the same cheesy dialogues as ever.\r\n\r\n - Requires Hearthfire\r\n\r\nTo initiate the additional dialogue :\r\n - Finish regular marriage pre-requisites.\r\n - Must own a home with an Alchemy Table (Vanilla+Hearthfire homes only!)\r\n - Must have the Alchemy skill at 50+\r\n - Must finish her personal quest (getting the ingredients)\r\n\r\nRecommended actions :\r\n -- The newlyweds should move to the Players home and NOT Ingun\\'s home --\r\n\r\nNotes :\r\n I think I accounted for all the Alchemy tables the player can place in his homes but if for some reason you own a house that has an alchemy table but can still not initiate the dialogue option then check the other prerequisites, if you are sure you fulfill them then report what house and what upgrade it is that is not working on the Nexusmod discussion page for this mod and I will look into it. I will not add support for any 3rd party mods that add houses.  A workaround if this comes up is buying Breezehome and adding an alchemy table there (the cheapest house+upgrade), there is no additional check for an alchemy table in houses once the player has married so you are free to move to whatever house you want to after you propose to her.\r\n\r\nChangelog :\r\n 0.1 Alpha / 21.9.2013\r\n  - Initial release, limited testing completed.\r\n\r\nAuthor : Sicarius100",
