  "descriptionHtml": "A small house situated behind the Inn in Riverwood to act as a basic house for new players. \r<br />\r<br />==Features== \r<br />-A bed, set to be owned by the player \r<br />-safe storage \r<br />-Cooking pot \r<br />-Wood Chopping Block \r<br />-Tabletop Enchanter \r<br />-Tabletop Alchemy lab \r<br />\r<br />==Requirements== \r<br />Does not require any dlc or other mods. Should work fine in the Vanilla game. \r<br />\r<br />==Compatibility== \r<br />Should be compatible with anything that doesn&#39;t modify that area of Riverwood. \r<br />\r<br />==Notes== \r<br />This is my first mod. I decided to make this because I was so frustated with the fact that all the houses added to the Riverwood area where either huge (by comparison), or too flashy for my tastes. So I decided to figure out how the creation kit works and make one myself. Now like I said this is my first mod, so any constructive criticism, tips, or suggestions are appriciated. \r<br />\r<br />==Future Plans== \r<br />I would like to add a small, no frills, house like this to all the villages in Skyrim eventually. But that will come when I undertsand the Creation Kit better.",
