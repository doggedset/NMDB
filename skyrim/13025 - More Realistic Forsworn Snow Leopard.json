Yes it is another Snow Leopard, but still, I hope someone likes it. (I did not alter the helmet for the outfit, because I believe that you could get a much better selection from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5865]83Willow\\'s mod[/url].)\r\n\r\nHopefully someone will use and/or enjoy this retex, I will be updating for various preferences, and if you have any comments on something that you would like to see changed, feel free to comment and I\\'ll see if I have the time to do so.\r\n",
