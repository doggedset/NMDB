  "descriptionHtml": "Stonehard (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/2006474) provided a mod whereby almost all objects no longer weighed anything - Nothing Weights (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17751).\r\n\r\nAfter downloading this and playing for a while I soon realised that fair proportion of objects still had a weight. Therefore, I decided to update the mod and correct those that had been missed. Behold, Nothing Weighs - Redux.\r\n\r\nAll objects in the main game (plus subsequent patches) have been rendered weghtless. There are a number of objects whose characteristics you do not appear to be able to modify. I\\'m guessing these are parent objects and therefore fixed.\r\n\r\nI haven\\'t included any objects from the official addons (e.g. Heathfire, Dawnguard or Dragonborne) so as to (hopefully) make this as widely available as possible.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
