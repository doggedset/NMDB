  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=4][b][u]Description\r<br />[/u][/b][/size][/center]Keeping things simple for my first mod. Arya is a female wood elf located at Hunters Rest in Falkreath hold. Talk to her and she will follow you. You can also marry her if you are wearing an amulet of Mara and have completed the necessary conversation with Maramal. By default she is equipped with the same armour as Aela the Huntress and wields an elven bow and arrows - as with all followers you can give her whatever equipment you want when she follows you.Â \r<br />\r<br />[center][size=4][b][u]Requirements\r<br />\r<br />[/u][/b][/size][/center]There are no requirements for this mod, it should run fine by itself. However I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND installing Better Females by Bella (or something similar). I have tested the mod with and without it and it has to be said that on vanilla Skyrim Arya looks truly terrible. I have designed it to be used with Better Females so apologies if you&#39;re using vanilla and she looks awful.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2812/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D2812&pUp=1]Better Females\r<br />\r<br />[/url][center][size=4][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2812/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D2812&pUp=1][/url][u]Installation\r<br />[/u][/size][/center]\r<br />Installing is really simple. Once the .rar finishes downloading all you need to do is extract the file and place it in your Skyrim data folder. The location of this folder may vary but mine is under Program Files(x86) &gt; Steam@SteamApps &gt; Common &gt; Skyrim &gt; Data. Alternatively just use the manager",
