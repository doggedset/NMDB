  "descriptionHtml": "[color=orange][size=6][b]Werewolf followers[/b][/size][/color]\r\nCreated by Brevi | www.spwned.net\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod provides the player with an option to infect any NPC follower (even those added by custom mods) with the Werewolf Curse. From that point on the NPCs will be able to (toggle) activate their Beast Form via dialogue. Please view the video demonstration to check out the features in action.\r\n\r\nNEWS: Version 1.6.3 is now ready.\r\n\r\n[center][url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvixDXZCp8o]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvixDXZCp8o[/url]\r\n[youtube]XvixDXZCp8o[/youtube]\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in30JrT7uQk]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in30JrT7uQk[/url]\r\n[youtube]in30JrT7uQk[/youtube][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://www.spwned.net/pics/tol/title_nexus_01.png[/img][/center]\r\n[color=orange][size=6][b]Features[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[list][*]The mod is scripted to be compatible with the widest variety of other Werewolf mods.\r\n[*]Any NPC follower can now gain the Werewolf Curse via the \\'Infect with Lycanthropy\\' dialogue option (even the ones added by custom mods).\r\n[*]Any NPC follower can be cured from the Werewolf Curse via the \\'Cure from Lycanthropy\\' dialogue option.\r\n[*]Followers infected with the Werewolf Curse can (toggle) activate their Beast Form via dialogue.[/list]\r\n- The only true limitation is that the NPC has to use one of the original 10 races in the game.\r\n- I can add custom races too if enough of you guys request it.\r\n- Literally unlimited number of Werewolf followers are possible, but only one can follow you at a time.\r\n[list][*]The NPC Werewolf transformation is scripted in detail to be as close to the player\\'s as possible:[/list]\r\n- Proper animations and effects apply.\r\n- Unarmed damage bonus for follower Werewolves is added and calculated by the same formula as for the player.\r\n- Armor rating should be the same as a player Werewolf.\r\n- NPC factions will attack the player and it\\'s follower upon noticing either to be a Werewolf.\r\n- NPCs move significantly faster while in Werewolf form.\r\n[list][*]New more sinister transformation sound for Werewolves. Imported from the old Morrowind mod McAsmod Werewolves.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange][size=6][b]Recommended Mods[/b][/size][/color]\r\nUse Tales of Lycanthropy together with the following great mods for the best effect and please don\\'t forget to endorse the authors of these impressive projects.

Kudos to the Morrowind McAsmod Werewolf mod team for the transformation sound file! Visit their website: [url=http://werewolves.skaarj.com]http://werewolves.skaarj.com[/url]\r\nFull list of credits of the original McAsmod here: [url=http://werewolves.skaarj.com/index.php?bg=1&page=credits]http://werewolves.skaarj.com/index.php?bg=1&page=credits[/url]\r\nNote however that none of the McAsmod team members worked on this mod. I just included their awesome sound file.\r\n\r\nBethesda for Skyrim and the Creation Kit.\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://www.spwned.net/pics/tol/title_nexus_03.png[/img][/center]\r\n[list][*]2012.03.07. Version 1.6.3 - Fixed the bug where caster NPCs would get stuck trying to use magic as a Werewolf.\r\n[*]2012.03.05. Version 1.6.2 - Fixed the bug where NPCs would sometimes re-equip their Werewolf FX armor in human form. NPCs now move significantly faster while in Werewolf form.\r\n[*]2012.03.04. Version 1.6.1 - Fixed the bug where dog followers could be infected with the Werewolf Curse.\r\n[*]2012.03.04. Version 1.6 - Added dialogue to infect/cure any NPC follower with Lycanthropy. Console commands no longer needed.\r\n[*]2012.03.04. Version 1.5 - Any NPC follower can gain the Werewolf Curse via console command (even the ones added by custom mods). Fixed the bugs where guards would not attack, fixed the bug where your follower would attack you.\r\n[*]2012.02.28. Version 1.0 - The whole script was rewritten from scratch and I\\'m confident that it will be compatible with almost any Werewolf mod out there. The mod only makes changes to the Follower Dialogue Quests now and nothing else.\r\n[*]2012.02.27. Alpha02 - Beast Form modified.\r\n[/list]",
