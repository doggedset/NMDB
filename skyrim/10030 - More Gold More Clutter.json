  "descriptionHtml": "Loot modification for the majority of containers around Skyrim, mainly chests, cupboards, wardrobes, sacks and a number of creatures, including town guards. Containers do not feel so empty as they once did and are generally more rewarding to get those boss chests in caves, ruins and tombs that are littered across the landscape.\r\n\r\nWhat this mod does:\r\n\r\n-Alters container and leveled list loot\r\n-Mixes up the loot amount dropped by several creatures (Atronachs for example)\r\n-Makes dungeon diving more rewarding\r\n-Adds some immersion\r\n\r\nWhat this mod does NOT do:\r\n\r\n-Alters vendor contents in stores\r\n-Directly alters encounter NPCs inventory such as bandits\r\n\r\n\r\nDrop the ESP into the Data folder and check in NMM or the main executable \\\"Data files\\\" section.\r\n\r\nIf one is interested, I have also made a \\\"More Gold More Clutter\\\" mods for Oblivion and Morrowind as well, seen below\r\n\r\nOblivion version: http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/12609\r\nMorrowind version: http://morrowind.nexusmods.com/mods/13218",
