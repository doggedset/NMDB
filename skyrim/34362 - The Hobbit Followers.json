  "descriptionHtml": "[color=gold][size=12][b]The Hobbit Followers:[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThis mod is a work in progress. It will add NPC followers from the Hobbit movie series. I am open to constructive critism so fell free to comment.\r\n\r\nThere are two version of the mod; one that uses the winter is coming mod to add cloaks and another that doesn\\'t. Use the one you want.\r\n\r\nAll NPCs are located in Dragonsreach for now.\r\n\r\n[color=green][size=5][b]Radagast the Brown:[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThe brown wizard is close to nature. He summons creatures of the forest to help him in combat. He has a unique staff that allows him to cast a new spell that unleashes nature\\'s wrath against his enemies.\r\nIf you want both his staff and him as a follower be aware that taking his deprives him of its power, therefore he will not be able to use the spell on enemies and will rely only on his beast friends!\r\nHe his dressed in brown robes with a cloak and hood from Winter is coming-Cloaks mod ( if you do not have it installed he will not wear the cloak). There is a slight bug if you use the cloak; the first time you meet him he will only have the cloak and the hood on.To fix that just trade something with him and all his clothes will appear!\r\nI might retexture his staff later on if you guys want. If you want to get Radagast\\'s spells tell me and I will upload a mod with them!\r\n\r\n[color=green][size=5][b]Thorin Oakenshield:[/b][/size][/color]\r\nThe leader of the dwarfs. He has his own armor and sword Oscrist.He is a worthy fighter and will fight to the kneel-down!\r\n\r\n[color=green][size=5][b]Bilbo Baggins:[/b][/size][/color]\r\nThe hobbit! He doesn\\'t have shoes. He has a gold ring but it doesn\\'t do anything (yet!). He has sting which is also not textured (I did not get permission to use Isilmeriel\\'s mod for the sword...). \r\nHe is not as brave as Thorin but he will still fight for a very long time! He is quite powerful.\r\n\r\n[color=green][size=5][b]Fili:[/b][/size][/color]\r\nNephew of Thorin, brother of Kili. He is also a worthy fighter and wields an axe in combat.\r\n\r\n[color=green][size=5][b]Kili:[/b][/size][/color]\r\nNephew of Thorin, brother of Fili. He uses archery when he can but wield an axe in close combat. He will also fight until death.\r\n\r\nIf you guys have any ideas on how to improve them, feel free to tell me!\r\n\r\nTranslations of the mod:\r\nGerman:   http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34377  by  Kajot \r\n\r\n\r\nChancelog:\r\n\r\nV. 1.12: Fixed the greyface bug.\r\nV. 1 : Added Radagast the Brown, Thorin Oakenshield, Bilbo Baggins, Fili and Kili. Thorin wield Oscrist and Bilbo Sting.\r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\nAll mods should work with mine. Please tell me if you encounter a clash.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nNivea for allowing me to use Winter is coming-Cloaks with my mod. Go and see her mod page if you haven\\'t seen it already!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!!!!",
