  "descriptionHtml": "Alchemist Shack - Player Home\r\n\r\nThis mod takes the existing Alchemist Shack (located in the fall forest) and makes it your very own player home.  Added containers and clutter, with a few extra features.  All containers are safe for storing your items (they will not respawn).  I tried to keep the atmosphere of the home in the spirit of its surroundings.  It makes for a great starter home or for anybody wanting to live in a secluded area of the wilderness.\r\n\r\nI plan on updating this with new features as I go along in my game.\r\n\r\nLocation:  The house is located south of Ivarstead, along the road between Ivarstead and Helgen.\r\n\r\nIf you do not like having a front door on the house, you can pull up the console and delete it.\r\n- press the \\\"~\\\" key\r\n- \\\"left click\\\" the door with your mouse\r\n- type in \\\"disable\\\" and press the \\\"enter\\\" key\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n\r\nv1.2 - Better lighting.  Added a food garden and a front door.\r\n\r\n\r\nv1.1 - Fixed random clutter items from respawning.\r\n\r\n\r\nv1.0 - First release",
