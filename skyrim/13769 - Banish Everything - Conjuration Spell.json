  "descriptionHtml": "[center][IMG]http://i40.tinypic.com/35813zr.png[/IMG][/center]\r\n[center][youtube]qgRm2YQOA1k[/youtube][/center]\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=3]Features[/size][/u][/b]\r\n\r\nThis mod gives players access to two new Conjuration Spell Called Banish Everything and Really Banish Everything.\r\n\r\nThe spells are a modified version of the \\\"Expert Expel Daedra\\\" spell. This version works on all creatures and NPCs, not just Daedra.\r\n\r\nBanish Everything is a kill spell that puts the Ghost Effect on targets making them appear to vanish but leaves a corpse for you to loot.\r\n\r\nReally Banish Everything is not a kill spell. Targets will be teleported away. Never to return.\r\n\r\nJust remember, if you cast this spell on a unique NPC (i.e. ones that are not set to respawn) they will be gone for good!\r\n\r\nFind the Spelltomes on the ground behind the blacksmith\\'s shop in Whiterun.\r\n\r\nIs it overpowered? Yes. \r\n\r\nIs it fun? YES!\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=3]Bugs[/size][/u][/b]\r\n\r\nWith the \\\"Banish Everything\\\" version, when you leave an area through a loading door the bodies of your victims will be visible when you return. Though you can reghostify the corpses by casting the spell at them. Also, NPCs that are set to \\\"Essential\\\" still cannot be killed but will have the ghost effect applied.\r\n\r\nPlease report any other bugs to the author.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u][size=3]Installation[/size][/u][/b]\r\n\r\n[u]Banish Everything[/u]\r\nDownload and install with the Nexus Mod Manager. If you choose to Manually Download, extract the .7zip file and place the Banish Everything.esp into your /Data file in your Skyrim directory. \r\n\r\n[u]Really Banish Everything[/u]\r\nDownload and install with the Nexus Mod Manager. If you choose to Manually Download, extract the .7zip file and place the Really Banish Everything.esp into your /Data file in your Skyrim directory. Also place the contents of the Scripts folder into your /Data/Scripts and /Data/Scripts/Source files in your Skyrim directory.\r\n\r\n[u]Other Notes[/u]\r\nNo longer supported. I do not plan to purchase Hearthfire due to a personal distaste for the product and so cannot mod with the new content. This mod should still work with unexpanded Skyrim (and Dawnguard if noted as such). Sorry for any inconvenience but with this game being almost a year old I feel it\\'s time to move on to newer modding horizons. Thank you to everyone who downloaded and enjoyed my Skyrim mods. I hope to see you all again in other mod workshops. Best wishes!",
