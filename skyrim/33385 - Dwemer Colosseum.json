Some of these problems arise randomly, others I think are caused by the engine. Assuming you have a decent computer, I recommend you install the following:\r<br />\r<br />SSME (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50305/?) - This mod helps reduce crashing by extending the amount of memory the engine can use. This should cover you in regards to RAM limitations set by the engine (3.1GB is an insta-crash)\r<br />\r<br />Any ENB with ENBoost (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24235/?) - This helps reduce your VRAM usage.\r<br />I use this one, since it is close to vanilla and does not use any blur effects.\r<br />\r<br />And of course you should have SKSE (http://skse.silverlock.org/) for the functionality it gives. Many other mods require it. Note that SKSE will eventually include the changes made in SSME. Then you will only need SKSE. Until then I recommend using SKSE+SSME.\r<br />\r<br />SKSE IS REQUIRED.\r<br />\r<br />AN ALTERNATIVE START MOD IS REQUIRED. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ONE, DOWNLOAD ONE HERE:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9557] Live Another Life [/url]\r<br />\r<br />STARTING A NEW GAME IS *NOT* REQUIRED.\r<br />\r<br />PLACE AN ALTERNATIVE START MOD BEFORE DWEMER COLOSSEUM IN YOUR LOAD ORDER. Please also note in Live Another Life you can still choose the vanilla start option if you want. That will bypass whatever issue my mod is having with the bethesda new game intro.\r<br />\r<br />[center][youtube]0Xnue7BQG7s[/youtube][youtube]JvRagn8z3Bs[/youtube][/center]\r<br />\r<br />What this mod features...\r<br />\r<br />Watching fights, betting on fights, fighting in fights, even manipulating fights&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Arena matches include:\r<br />\r<br />Gladiator (1v1), Team Gladiator (min 3v3-6v6 max), Mage in the Cage, Free For All\r<br />\r<br />Join one of two factions to explore a fully voiced questline leading up to your reign as grandchampion. Experience the innovations of a true warrior and a scholar as the ultimate prize of your life.\r<br />\r<br />Remember... the Colosseum hungers for blood, and you hunger for the sound of battle vibrating through your very soul&#33; Let us all get what we want in the one, the only, Dwemer Colosseum&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Recommended Mods:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18045/?]My Home is your Home[/url] (very useful for airship)\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3871]Weapons of the Third Era[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18436]ASIS[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24909]aMidianBorn Book of Silence[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Regarding issues (FAQ/Troubleshooting):\r<br />&#34;Help my game crashed&#34; - Probably a conflict or your system had a hiccup. This mod is not going to run well on low machines.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;When I start a new game my character is stuck looking at a cart, and I can&#39;t move&#34; - Read the &#34;important information&#34; like you should have from the start.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Your mod broke my game&#34; - ...no... it didn&#39;t... &gt;.&gt;\r<br />\r<br />Permissions: This mod is to remain Nexus-exclusive.
