  "descriptionHtml": "This is a localisation mod that changes the in-game text spellings from American English to English (or British English if you prefer). It also attempts to fix most of the text-based errors present in the base vanilla game (subtitle/voice mismatches etc.). It covers the base Skyrim game, official patch updates, Dawnguard DLC, Hearthfire DLC, and Dragonborn DLC. \r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s not that the version of English that is found in America is wrong, it&#39;s just not the same as the English taught in England, Australia, and so on.\r<br />\r<br />This mod was originally made for my own use, but I was asked to release it. So here it is for those who want it. Please do not upload this mod anywhere without my permission.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]The Skyrim SE version of this mod can be found here: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1842/]English Strings for Skyrim SE[/url].\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=00CC00][b]------------------------------------\r<br />What does this mod change?\r<br />------------------------------------[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />In addition to the English spelling changes there are some secondary changes as well:\r<br />\r<br />* Over 700 errors in the vanilla text have been fixed. Mostly general typos and spelling mistakes in item names, subtitles, quest text, and books.\r<br />* Most Dwarven named items are now Dwemer, not Dwarven.\r<br />* In the Character Generation menu most of the races are listed by their proper names, rather than the common name (i.e. Altmer instead of High Elf).\r<br />* The generically named &#34;Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary&#34; is now named the &#34;Pine Forest Sanctuary&#34;.\r<br />* The General Stat named &#34;Dragon Souls Collected&#34; has been renamed to &#34;Dragon Souls Absorbed&#34;.\r<br />* The UI inventory category &#34;Misc&#34; has been changed to &#34;Miscellaneous&#34;.\r<br />* All enchanted armour items are now properly identified as being light/heavy variants to match the naming of their unenchanted counterparts.\r<br />* Added place names to some quest objectives to serve as a quick reminder as to where the questgiver/target was located (mostly misc quests).\r<br />* Alduin is named simply as &#34;Black Dragon&#34; for his appearance in Helgen since the Player Character doesn&#39;t know that it&#39;s him at that point in time.\r<br />* The blessing given by Talos shrines now correctly displays as &#34;Time between shouts is reduced 20%&#34; instead of &#34;Time between shouts is reduced 0%&#34;.\r<br />* Fixed several notes and letters that used the printed book font instead of the handwriting font as intended.\r<br />* Altered the naming and formatting of all the vanilla recipes so they match the naming and formatting that was used for recipes in the Dragonborn DLC.\r<br />* Differentiation: Renamed some of the generically named clothes, boots, and shoes (Barkeep, Chef, Hooded, Mage, Merchant, Miner, Monk, Necromancer, Redguard).\r<br />* Differentiation: All Hooded Robes now properly identified as Hooded Robes (instead of the generic &#34;Robes&#34;).\r<br />* Differentiation: Three of the four variants of &#34;Fur Armour&#34; renamed: &#34;Fur Kilt&#34;, &#34;Fur Kilt & Cloak&#34;, and &#34;Fur Armour, Sleeveless&#34;.\r<br />* Differentiation: Renamed one of two identially named &#34;Steel Armour&#34; sets to &#34;Steel Pauldron Armour&#34;.\r<br />* Differentiation: The generically named chests found in Dwemer ruins are now named Dwemer chests.\r<br />* Differentiation: The generically named Chaurus chitin & bone chests found in Falmer camps are now named Falmer chests.\r<br />* Differentiation: Renamed the generically named Chaurus egg sacs from &#34;Egg Sacs&#34; to &#34;Chaurus Egg Sac&#34;.\r<br />* Differentiation: The four different types of generically named &#34;Embalming Tool&#34; renamed slightly according to their function (Embalming Scalpel, Scissors, Knife, Pick).\r<br />* Differentiation: Most generically named bowls, candlesticks, cups, goblets, plates, platter, pots, urns renamed slightly according to their make (Glazed, Nordic, Silver).\r<br />* Differentiation: Renamed the editor designated large and giant Mudcrabs to &#34;Large Mudcrab&#34; and &#34;Giant Mudcrab&#34; respectively.\r<br />* Differentiation: Renamed the editor designated large Frostbite Spider to &#34;Large Frostbite Spider&#34;. The giant Frostspider was already named &#34;Giant Frostbite Spider&#34; so didn&#39;t need alteration.\r<br />* Differentiation: Renamed the generic civil war &#34;Corpse&#34; actors to &#34;Dead Imperial Soldier&#34; and &#34;Dead Stormcloak Soldier&#34; accordingly.\r<br />* Armour enchantment rename: &#34;Dwindling Fire&#34; is now &#34;Dwindling Flames&#34;.\r<br />* Armour enchantment rename: &#34;Flame Suppression&#34; is now &#34;Fire Suppression&#34;.\r<br />* Armour enchantment rename: &#34;Conjuring&#34; is now &#34;Conjuration&#34; to match the naming of the other magical schools.\r<br />* Renamed &#34;Steel Cuffed Boots&#34; to &#34;Steel Nordic Boots&#34; as they are a matching pair to the Steel Nordic Bracers.\r<br />* Renamed &#34;Ancient Nord&#34; items to &#34;Ancient Nordic&#34; and &#34;Nord Hero&#34; items to &#34;Nordic&#34; as they are simply reforged versions of the Ancient Nordic items. They are still under &#34;Draugr&#34; on the forge, though.\r<br />* Renamed the Dragon Priest Masks (i.e. &#34;Otar&#34; becomes &#34;Dragon Priest Otar&#39;s Mask&#34;).\r<br />* Renamed the few &#34;Battle Axe&#34; weapons to &#34;Battleaxe&#34; for consistency.\r<br />* Renamed the few &#34;Strong Box&#34; containers to &#34;Strongbox&#34; for consistency.\r<br />* Renamed the generic &#34;Burned Book&#34; to &#34;Burnt Book&#34;.\r<br />* Renamed the generic &#34;Elder Scroll&#34; to &#34;Elder Scroll (Dragon)&#34; to match the item name change in Dawnguard.\r<br />* Renamed the &#34;Cure Poison&#34; potion to &#34;Potion of Cure Poison&#34; to match naming of the Potion of Cure Disease.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=00CC00][b]-----------------\r<br />Compatibility\r<br />-----------------[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />In theory this mod should be compatible with any mod that doesn&#39;t modify any of the following files: \r<br />\r<br />Data&#92;Strings&#92;Dawnguard_English.DLSTRINGS\r<br />Data&#92;Strings&#92;Dawnguard_English.ILSTRINGS\r<br />Data&#92;Strings&#92;Dawnguard_English.STRINGS\r<br />Data&#92;Strings&#92;Dragonborn_English.DLSTRINGS\r<br />Data&#92;Strings&#92;Dragonborn_English.ILSTRINGS\r<br />Data&#92;Strings&#92;Dragonborn_English.STRINGS\r<br />Data&#92;Strings&#92;Hearthfires_English.DLSTRINGS\r<br />Data&#92;Strings&#92;Hearthfires_English.ILSTRINGS\r<br />Data&#92;Strings&#92;Hearthfires_English.STRINGS\r<br />Data&#92;Strings&#92;Skyrim_English.DLSTRINGS\r<br />Data&#92;Strings&#92;Skyrim_English.ILSTRINGS\r<br />Data&#92;Strings&#92;Skyrim_English.STRINGS\r<br />Data&#92;Strings&#92;Update_English.DLSTRINGS\r<br />Data&#92;Strings&#92;Update_English.ILSTRINGS\r<br />Data&#92;Strings&#92;Update_English.STRINGS\r<br />Data&#92;Interface&#92;Translate_ENGLISH.txt\r<br />\r<br />That being said, since this mod changes the base Strings files, where the game grabs all its in-game text from, any mod plugin (.esm,.esp) that edits the vanilla text will override what is in the Strings file and replace it with the new text located within the plugin file. So, for example, new & edited items/quests/spells/perks etc. created by mods will have the exact same text the mod author gave it since that text comes from their mod&#39;s plugin file.\r<br />\r<br />[color=FF0000][b]IMPORTANT:[/b][/color]\r<br />The official patches also change some of the String files, which will override some of the changes I&#39;ve made in this mod. After updating your game to the latest version you will need to re-install this mod.\r<br />\r<br />Also note that if you verify the integrity of your game cache on Steam it will replace all these files with the original ones, so be aware that this mod will need to be re-installed afterwards.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=00CC00][b]--------------------------------------------------\r<br />What text do the different files contain?\r<br />--------------------------------------------------[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />.DLSTRINGS - This file contains all book body text and quest description text.\r<br />.ILSTRINGS - This file contains all NPC dialogue subtitles.\r<br />.STRINGS   - This file contains all item names, actor names, race names, location names, quest objectives, loading screen text, player dialogue choices, some UI text.\r<br />.txt       - This file contains most of the UI text.\r<br />\r<br />Also note that the &#34;Update_English&#34; files are edited/added to by the official patches.\r<br />\r<br />[color=00CC00][b]------------\r<br />To Install\r<br />------------[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />1. Backup the existing Strings folder (Data&#92;Strings). Yes, I mean it - back those original files up&#33;\r<br />2. Backup the &#34;Translate_ENGLISH.txt&#34; file which resides in the &#34;Data&#92;Interface&#34; folder. If you don&#39;t have one - don&#39;t worry.\r<br />3. Extract the downloaded file into your Skyrim folder (click &#39;yes to overwrite&#39; if necessary).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=00CC00][b]-------------\r<br />To Remove\r<br />-------------[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />1. Copy your previously backed up Strings folder into your &#34;Data&#92;Strings&#34; folder, overwriting all existing files.\r<br />2. Copy your old &#34;Translate_ENGLISH.txt&#34; file which resides in the &#34;Data&#92;Interface&#34; folder. If you didn&#39;t have one before, simply delete the file.\r<br />\r<br />Another way to remove the mod is to verify the integrity of your game cache on Steam and it will replace all altered files with the original ones.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=00CC00][b]---------------\r<br />Change Log\r<br />---------------[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />v2.2.3 (1/9/2014)\r<br />- Fixed more vanilla subtitle audio/subtitle text mismatch errors (Adril Arano, Bersi Honeyhand, Delvin Mallory, Falion, Nazir, Thrynn, Ri&#39;saad).\r<br />- Renamed misnamed letter in Honningbrew Meadery from &#34;Have Need of Cynric&#34; to &#34;Final Offer&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />v2.2.2 (4/6/2014)\r<br />- Fixed error that stopped the images in the book &#34;Oghma Infinium&#34; from displaying correctly.\r<br />\r<br />v2.2.1 (28/10/2013)\r<br />- Renamed &#34;Steel Armour w/ Pauldrons&#34; to &#34;Steel Pauldron Armour&#34; to be in line with the Dragonborn DLC naming conventions.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;aerie&#34; to &#34;eyrie&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;aging&#34; to &#34;ageing&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;analyze(d)&#34; to &#34;analyse(d)&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;annex&#34; to &#34;annexe&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;ass&#34; to &#34;arse&#34; (excluding the donkey references).\r<br />- Word change: &#34;ax&#34; to &#34;axe&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;caliber&#34; to &#34;calibre&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;calipers&#34; to &#34;callipers&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;canceled&#34; to &#34;cancelled&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;cozy&#34; to &#34;cosy&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;cruelest&#34; to &#34;cruellest&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;defense(s)&#34; to &#34;defence(s)&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;disoriented&#34; to &#34;disorientated&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;draft&#34; to &#34;draught&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;duelists&#34; to &#34;duellists&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;encyclopedia&#34; to &#34;encyclopaedia&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;fiber(s)&#34; to &#34;fibre(s)&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;filet&#34; to &#34;fillet&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;fulfill(ment)&#34; to &#34;fulfil(ment)&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;license&#34; to &#34;licence&#34; [noun-verb distinction].\r<br />- Word change: &#34;livable&#34; to &#34;liveable&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;gotten&#34; to &#34;got&#34; (excluding all subtitles).\r<br />- Word change: &#34;maneuver(ed/ing)&#34; to &#34;manoeuvr(e/ed/ing)&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;marvelous&#34; to &#34;marvellous&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;meager&#34; to &#34;meagre&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;mislabeled&#34; to &#34;mislabelled&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;mold(ed/ering/s)&#34; to &#34;mould(ed/ering/s)&#34; (excluding Bonemold).\r<br />- Word change: &#34;offense&#34; to &#34;offence&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;plow(ing)&#34; to &#34;plough(ing)&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;practice(d)&#34; to &#34;practise(d)&#34; [noun-verb distinction].\r<br />- Word change: &#34;pretense&#34; to &#34;pretence&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;quarreled&#34; to &#34;quarrelled&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;signaled&#34; to &#34;signalled&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;sizable&#34; to &#34;sizeable&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;skeptic(al)&#34; to &#34;sceptic(al)&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;skillfully&#34; to &#34;skilfully&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;smolder(ed/ing)&#34; to &#34;smoulder(ed/ing)&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;specialty&#34; to &#34;speciality&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;sulfur&#34; to &#34;sulphur&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;theater(s)&#34; to &#34;theatre(s)&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;tidbit&#34; to &#34;titbit&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;traveling&#34; to &#34;travelling&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;unlikable&#34; to &#34;unlikeable&#34;.\r<br />- Word change: &#34;willful&#34; to &#34;wilful&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />v2.2.0 (7/7/2013)\r<br />- Fixed several missed instances of &#34;learned&#34; (books, UI text).\r<br />- Cleaned up formatting and naming of the Goldenglow Estate documents (books).\r<br />- Renamed &#34;Robbers&#39; Cove&#34; cell to &#34;Robber&#39;s Cove&#34;.\r<br />- Renamed &#34;Markarth Wizards&#39; Balcony&#34; cell to &#34;Calcelmo&#39;s Balcony&#34;.\r<br />- Renamed &#34;Wizards&#39; Guard&#34; actors to &#34;Mercenary&#34;.

Some of the generically named clothes, boots, and shoes renamed (Barkeep, Chef, Hooded, Mage, Merchant, Miner, Monk, Necromancer, Redguard).\r<br />- Differentiation: Clothes.

Generically named variants of &#34;Fur Armour&#34; renamed: &#34;Fur Kilt&#34;, &#34;Fur Kilt & Cloak&#34;, &#34;Fur Armour, Sleeveless&#34;, and &#34;Fur Armour&#34;.\r<br />- Renamed &#34;Steel Cuffed Boots&#34; to &#34;Steel Nordic Boots&#34; as they are a matching pair to the Steel Nordic Bracers.\r<br />- Renamed &#34;Ancient Nord&#34; items to &#34;Ancient Nordic&#34; and &#34;Nord Hero&#34; items to &#34;Nordic&#34; as they are simply reforged versions of the Ancient Nordic items.

Mostly items (i.e. Enchanted Imperial heavy and light armour items were named exactly the same way. Now the light variants are named light to be in line with their non-enchanted cousins).\r<br />- Differentiation: Armour. Renamed one of the identially named &#34;Steel Armour&#34; sets to &#34;Steel Armour w/ Pauldrons&#34; in order to differentiate between the two different looking sets. If someone can think of a better name, I&#39;m open to suggestions.\r<br />- Fixed issue with the two Nightingale books not showing their volume numbers correctly.\r<br />\r<br />v2.0.4 (15/2/2012)\r<br />- Fixed a further 340 errors in the vanilla books and subtitles.\r<br />\r<br />v2.0.3 (13/2/2012)\r<br />- Fixed roughly 300 errors in the vanilla books and item names.\r<br />\r<br />v2.0.2 (10/2/2012)\r<br />- Fixed two missed instances of &#34;endeavored&#34;.\r<br />- Fixed four missed instances of &#34;flavor&#34;.\r<br />- Fixed two small errors in the vanilla text to do with Medresi&#39;s quest.\r<br />- Changed the UI inventory category &#34;Misc&#34; to &#34;Miscellaneous&#34;. I found that it helps with selecting that category with the mouse, which I have always found frustrating when the mouse &#34;misses&#34; the text.\r<br />\r<br />v2.0.1 (8/2/2012 - Creation Kit released)\r<br />- Renamed missed player&#39;s Orcish Vampire race.

They were bothering me so I fixed them. The possessive of a plural noun that already ends in -s just has an apostrophe (i.e. the Johnsons&#39; house instead of the Johnsons&#39;s house).\r<br />- Differentiation: Chests. The generically named chests found in Dwemer ruins are now named Dwemer chests.\r<br />- Differentiation: Chests.
