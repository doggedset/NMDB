  "summary": "GuitunScarfin&#39;s Apotheus Light Armor with Imperial or Stormcloak insignias... now with faction color scarves.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Do you like GuitunScarfin&#39;s Apotheus Light Armor so much that even when you take a side in the civil war, you&#39;d rather wear it than the armors they try to suit you up in?\r<br />\r<br />I do.\r<br />\r<br />So... why not show what side you support on the armor itself?\r<br />\r<br />Now you can&#33;  Just take the cuirass to any forge with an inkwell (now you FINALLY have a reason to carry one around) and paint the insignia of whichever side you choose, be it the Imperials or the Stormcloaks, on the chestplate.\r<br />\r<br />Now, if you prefer to wear the scarf, which covers the chestplate, and therefore hiding your artwork... then no worries.  You can also customize the gauntlets, too.\r<br />\r<br />Now for your next question: &#34;Why do I have to take them to a forge just to paint a logo on the armor?&#34;  Well, I tried to get the game to use the crafting table for it, but for some reason it just wouldn&#39;t work.  So I didn&#39;t have much of a choice.\r<br />\r<br />A bit of a warning: if you have already improved and/or enchanted the armor... reforging it will reduce it to its base level and remove the enchantment, so you will have to reimprove and reenchant it again.\r<br />\r<br />Also, one thing I altered... I changed the inventory images to what armor the Apotheus Armor most resembles.  So the body pieces will show up as Nightingale armor and the helm as a steel helm.  However, they are all still listed as Dragonscale, so they still remain a matching set.\r<br />\r<br />And as an added bonus, I included one little easter egg...\r<br />\r<br />Ulag had one last skooma induced epiphany before he died.  He made a note of it, and left the note forgotten in the last place he slept before he left Whiterun to meet his untimely end.\r<br />\r<br />Thank you, GuitunScarfin for your permission to release this... and I hope everyone enjoys this.\r<br />\r<br />Site of the original armor: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19501\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE:  I uploaded modified versions of the original textures for those who prefer the &#34;newly made&#34; look, as opposed to the subtle &#34;wear and tear&#34; of the textures in the main file.\r<br />\r<br />ANOTHER UPDATE:  With RabbitFly&#39;s help, I fixed the glove finger problem.  Should also work for the original armor mod as well.\r<br />\r<br />LATEST UPDATE:  I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t think of it before, but I just did.  Now there is an optional file so that you can wear the scarf in the proper faction color, for those of you who prefer to wear the scarf.  When you find the original armor, it will come with the green scarf... however, when you take a side in the civil war, you can make a scarf in Imperial red or Stormcloak blue.  There are also &#34;special&#34; versions of the scarves as well.  Also, in this newer version, you take the armor to the tanning rack to apply the insignias.  The scarf recolors were made by GuitunScarfin, of course.",
