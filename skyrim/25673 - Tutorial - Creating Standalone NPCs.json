  "descriptionHtml": "[color=red]***********************************************************\r<br />I AM NOT ACTIVELY MODDING SKYRIM AT THE MOMENT.\r<br />\r<br />Anything I created is free for use and derivitive work. None of mods were complete and I apologize that some of them were never finished. If someone wants to pick up where I left off, they are welcome to use my work by either uploading their own mod or I can give them access to that mod&#39;s page. \r<br />\r<br />My custom work will continue as planned. \r<br />\r<br />Thanks everyone for your support and hopefully I will come back soon. But alas, I have a seasonal job and until April 15th, I don&#39;t know how much time I will have, or when I do have time, if I&#39;ll want to return to skyrim modding.\r<br />*********************************************************** [/color]\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE 1.1 - Fixed link between pages 4 and 5, and added an appendix on facetint, changing haircolor, and much more&#33;\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE 1.2 - Fixed broken images and link between pages 5 and 6.\r<br />\r<br />Big thanks to Insane0hFlex for featuring my tutorial:\r<br />[youtube]xO96h_UE1A8[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />My attempt to share my knowledge on creating NPC&#39;s with customized appearances. This will allow your followers to have their appearance &#39;out of the box&#39; without any other mods installed. \r<br />\r<br />I do ask that if you use my tutorial to create a follower that you link back to it, I like to know that I&#39;ve helped others&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Note/disclaimer: I am new to modding, and this is my very first tutorial on ANYTHING EVER. There are other ways to do just about everything in this tutorial, and I&#39;m sure there are faster/better ways. I&#39;m just offering my knowledge, I don&#39;t pretend to know all. Please keep that in mind, and let me know if there&#39;s something I can improve upon. Also this has NOT been proofread, and i did a lot of it in the wee hours of the morning. \r<br />\r<br />Credits (aka the mods I ripped apart to see how to do this&#33;):\r<br />Basskimm - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21038\r<br />Grospolina - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23337\r<br />Mayatola - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24664\r<br />hellosanta - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24061 and http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24881\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Planned Updates: \r<br />Appendix A: Consolidating Folders to Save Time/Disk Space\r<br />Appendix B: Appearance Mod Guide\r<br />\r<br />DONE 10/19 UPDATE 1.1 - Appendix C: Facegen Tweaks:\r<br />-Optional - Edit facetint\r<br />-Optional - Changing Haircolor\r<br />-Optional - Opening Head in Photoshop 3D",
