  "descriptionHtml": "Known bugs: There is a duplicate of Lydia in Dragonsreach.  I have no idea why, trying to fix it.\r\n\r\n*IMPORTANT: Read this if you read anything.\r\nThis file includes a texture recolour of 1 vanilla assest; one of the floors of the Katariah ship (I have no idea what it is, so I assume it\\'s not something major).  It simply recolours it to match Jorrvaskr\\'s walls and support beams, as it is the floor of the loft.\r\nI would also like to know if there are any problems with the following homes, as I copied some assests from them.  I very highly doubt there will be any issues (certainly no game damaging ones) but I just want to be sure:\r\nMarkarth - Vlindrel Hall\r\nWhiterun - Breezehome\r\nWindhelm - Hjerim\r\n\r\nIf they are just drop a line in the comments saying so, would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/JAjAf.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThis the first mod I\\'ve ever done, so if you have any suggestions on how I could improve just let me know, I always welcome constructive criticism :)\r\n\r\nWorks best with: \r\nNecessary Map Markers by usaid1234 - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5730\r\nWorthy Noble Furniture by realadry1 - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9178\r\n\r\nThe loft itself is meant to be minimalist and reflect the ideals of the Companions while still providing the functionality and customization options that we\\'ve all come to love such as bookshelves, weapon racks, and mannequins.\r\n\r\nDon\\'t let the small size of the loft deceive you, it comes fully packed with everything you might need.  The full list is as follows:\r\n\r\nBed\r\nShrine of Akatosh\r\nShrine of Zenithar\r\nAlchemy Workstation\r\nEnchanting Workstation\r\nGrindstone\r\nAnvil\r\nWorkbench\r\n2 fully functional bookshelves\r\n5 individual weapon racks\r\n1 shield and 2x weapon plaque (above the bed)\r\n2 mannequins\r\nFor storage:\r\n1x Alchemist satchel\r\n5x cloth sacks\r\n1x barrel\r\n2x Chests\r\n3x strongbox\r\n1x safe\r\n1x cupboard\r\nFor a total of 14 different containers (all non-respawning).\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, I\\'ve added some minor decorations to the entrance to Jorrvaskr, as well as placing a much needed workbench at the Skyforge.\r\n\r\nIf you encounter any bugs, please post what they are in the comments, and please try and remember that it\\'s just me working on this, so any help or suggestions on how to solve bugs that might pop up would be greatly appreciated :)\r\n\r\nI have some tentative plans to expand Jorrvaskr even further, since I just love its environment and general feel (I\\'m half Norwegian and half Irish, so mead hall + fiddle music = win!), so any suggestions on what you\\'d like to see in regards to an expanded Companions faction/Jorrvaskr would be great as well, just post a comment in the thread!  Right now I\\'m thinking of new NPCs to make the hall feel less empty, some small shanty homes/tents for refugees of the war who\\'ve been given sanctuary by the companions, perhaps some new quests, and other goodies :D",
