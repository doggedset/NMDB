  "modName": "3rd Person Eating and Drinking Animation",
  "summary": "Adds eating and drinking animation to 3rd person view",
  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a couple of scripts and magical effects that add drinking animations to Ale, Meads, and Wine.  There is also an animation for when you eat bread.  The animations only works when your character is viewed in the 3rd person view.  The animation works when you\\'re both standing and sitting, however it doesn\\'t work when you are sitting at the bar or at a table with your elbows on the table.\r\n\r\nInstall the scripts into: \\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Scripts\r\n\r\nA couple of notes:\r\n-I\\'ve used the looped animation for drinking Wine and eating Bread.  When you are standing, you have to un-sheath your weapon or jump in order to stop the animation loop.  I haven\\'t determined the best way around this just yet other than to not used the looped version of the animation.\r\n-This might not work with other mods that change the properties of Ale, Wine, Mead, or Bread.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Morfoide for getting me started down the path of creating this mod.  This is my first mod that I\\'ve created, so I hope it works for everyone else.  I\\'ll monitor the comments periodically and try to provide help when I can.  I\\'ll also review the comments for suggestions on how to make this mod better.\r\n\r\nV 0.2 Update:  I believe this version fixes the random activation of the eat/drink animation and activation of the animation during combat.  This should also fix the bug associated with drinking or eating with your weapon drawn.",
