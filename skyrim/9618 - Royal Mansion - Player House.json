  "summary": "Sick of the same old houses? Why not go bigger and better! The Royal Mansion is big castle-like player home.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Most house mods a just simple rehashes of existing homes. That\\'s why when the Dovahkin Hideout was released I really liked it. When the Creation Kit went live I decided to make a player home of my own. It\\'s completely build from scratch using a large variety of the existing Skyrim assets. I didn\\'t use any base to start with and it doesn\\'t replace anything. It\\'s not completely finished in my opinion, but I\\'ve spend a long time working on it and it\\'s completely opperational. Yes it is big/huge, but you\\'re the Dovahkin, the hero of Skyrim, you deserve a big house.\r\n\r\nThe player house is directly available for all and is marked \\\"Royal Mansion\\\" on the map, nearby Riverwood. (warning: English is not my native language)\r\n\r\nIncluding:[/b]\r\n- 14 mannequins\r\n- 14 large display cases (swords)\r\n- 11 small display cases (daggers) (update 1.1)\r\n- 5 weapon racks (1 of 5, 4 of 4) (update 1.1)\r\n- 9 shield/weapon plaques (update 1.1)\r\n- 4 large bookcases (storage containers)\r\n- 6 actual bookcases (update 1.2)\r\n- 2 wardrobes\r\n- 2 nighttables for storage\r\n- 5 storage chests (update 1.2)\r\n- 4 satchels for storage (update 1.2)\r\n- complete forge (including skyforge, update 1.2)\r\n- alchemy and enchantment table\r\n- Shrine of the Arkane and Shrine of Talos\r\n\r\n- Two guard NPC\\'s\r\n- Merchant NPC\r\n- Blacksmith NPC\r\n- Follower NPC\r\n\r\n[b]These are divided over 6 rooms:[/b]\r\n- Hall (2 mannequins)\r\n- Armory (10 mannequins, 14 large display cases, 11 small display cases, 5 weapon racks, 9 weapon/shield plaques & Shrine of Talos)\r\n- Magic room (alchemy table, enchantment table, Shrine of the Arkane, 2 satchels)\r\n- Bedroom/Library/Kitchen room (2 mannequins, 4 bookcases, 2 wardrobes, 2 nighttables, 3 storage chests)\r\n- Forge (all forge related stuff, 1 storage chest)\r\n- Bathroom\r\n\r\n[b]Future plans[/b]\r\n- Change the exterior look (maybe make it look like a small castle from the outside)\r\n- Add servants/guards/beards etc. \r\n- Make it so that your wife can live here\r\n\r\n[b]Update 1.3:[/b]\r\n+ Added a bathroom with bath (left of the left stairs)\r\n+ Added two guard NPC\\'s\r\n+ Added a follower NPC\r\n+ Added a merchant NPC\r\n+ Added a blacksmith NPC (not a vendor, one is enough in the house)\r\n- Removed the two extra satchels and replaced them with others\r\n= Fixed the shimering wall in the library\r\n= Fixed the library (not working before for anyone, and no you will not lose anything)\r\n= Fixed the lighting in the forge and armory (made the armory a lot brighter\r\n= Fixed the collision issiues on the exterior\r\n= Fixed one display case and one weapon rack in the armory\r\n= Fixed the grainmill location (with clipping)\r\n\r\n[b]Update 1.2:[/b]\r\n= Rehash of bedroom. Bigger area containing semi-seperate: bigger kitchen, bedroom and bigger library\r\n= Changed the forge into the Skyforge (and added some random stuff)\r\n+ Added a storage chest to the forge area\r\n+ Added two satchels to the Magic room\r\n+ Added 6 actual bookcases\r\n- Removed static crownstand (although I like it, I really can\\'t find a place to put it... and well it\\'s static so no reall loss)\r\n= Fixed collision issues with god statues and dragon statue\r\n= Fixed collision area in Magic room, you can no longer fall out \r\n\r\n[b]Update 1.1:[/b]\r\n- Removed 4 dagger cases\r\n- Removed throne\r\n- Removed torch holders\r\n+ Added working candle lights instead of torch holders\r\n+ Added weaponracks to the armory\r\n+ Added weapon/shield plaques\r\n+ Added new throne with working 1st person view when sitting\r\n= Fixed walkthrough DragonMask altar problem\r\n= Fixed conflicting lights\r\n= Rehashed the forge, looks better now\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems, glitches or suggestions, let me know and I\\'ll try to incorperate it in the next release.\r\n\r\nNote: The NPC\\'s aren\\'t perfect yet, but it\\'s a start.\r\n\r\nPS: I\\'ll upload a video soon\r\nPS(2): The screenshots are without AA, since I\\'m playing the game in 3D and don\\'t need it myself)\r\n\r\nSteam Workshop link: \\\"[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=11417]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=11417[/url]\\\"",
