  "summary": "Adds a few things to the jail cells.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple mod that adds a few things to the jail cells of skyrim.\r\n\r\nCompletely inspired by EmhyrTyl\\'s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18009]Crime and Punishment[/url].\r\nA mod that makes the crime system in skyrim a little more enjoyable, or dreadful. Where you will have to wait out your conviction based on your crimes.\r\n\r\nAnd it was fueled by [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10639]Imp\\'s More Complex Needs[/url]. A mod that makes eating, drinking, and sleeping essential to your life.\r\n\r\nAnd finally provoked by [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12452]Sleeping - Fast Travel - and Waiting Dangers - Sands of Time[/url]. where sleeping in  dangerous places will give a chance of being ambushed in your sleep. \r\n\r\ncombining these three mods would provoke me to sustain myself with food and water to prevent massive skill loss and death of starvation. And the bandits that attack during sleep would ultimately destroy me with the stats so greatly reduced from being starved. All trying to survive the sentance in jail.\r\n\r\nThe Room:\r\nThe room will now contain a few containers for some raw food and vegetables, ingredients, and a pot of food. The containers hold a pretty goood amount of food, and the only drink is a mead barrel. You must balance your food wisely if you dont want to starve the remaining days.\r\n\r\nLog:\r\nV 0.5:\r\nAdded Windhelm and Solitude.\r\n\r\nInitial:\r\nAs of now, only Whiterun and Riften jails have been modified.\r\n\r\nIssues:\r\nThe only issue as of late is an imbalance of food and ingredients.",
