  "descriptionHtml": "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nI\\'ve always felt the backwards power attack for one-handed weapons was kinda...off\r\nThis seeks to remedy that, instead of stepping back and doing a chop attack, you will instead use the two handed backwards power attack, and grip your sword with both hands and do a turning slash. This preserves the vanilla Skyrim feel, instead of having a flashy anime moveset that doesn\\'t fit very well with the game. \r\n\r\nTo install, just place the Meshes folder inside of your data folder\r\n\r\nTo uninstall go to data/meshes/actors/character/animations and delete the \\\"1hm_attackpowerbwd.hkx\\\" file",
