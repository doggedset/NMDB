In the olden days, when dragons darkened the skies, it was known that with every man and woman devoured, every village burned, every city razed, the knowledge of the dragons grew. And so, through their souls and their very life blood, the Dragonborn can absorb this great knowledge. We have only to wait for the dragons&#39; return, for they shall bring with the wisdom of old...&#34;\r<br />[right]- Arastyan, the Elder\r<br />Book of the Elder War[/right][/i][/quote]\r<br />\r<br />[b][center]2 ---------------- Whats and Whys ------------------[/center][/b]\r<br />\r<br />No, Arastyan, the Elder is not a lore-friendly character. Call it fan-fiction, lol. I&#39;ll answer a few questions I know you have up front. If you have others, I&#39;ll do my best to see to them, but this is a pretty simple mod, so I don&#39;t foresee you guys being very confused.\r<br />\r<br />[b]What is it?[/b]\r<br />&#34;No More Picky Perks&#34; is simply a mod that removes the skill level minimums from all of the Vanilla game perks. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Why would I want such an unbalancing mod?[/b]\r<br />Good question. Mostly, this is designed to make several other mods a bit more useful -- \r<br />\r<br />[i]&#34;Dragon Blood&#34;[/i] by DistinctlyMinty \r<br />[i]&#34;Ish&#39;s Souls to Perks&#34;[/i] by ishmaeltheforsaken and Oscar Wilde. \r<br />\r<br />Alternatively, you can use [i]&#34;Dragon Souls to Perks&#34;[/i] by NullCascade. I prefer Ish&#39;s, but Null&#39;s mod is excellent too. The difference is that Ish&#39;s gives you a perk point for each soul while Null&#39;s requires ten souls per perk point. It&#39;s a bit overkill for me, but to each his own. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Do I HAVE to have those mods for NMPP to work?[/b]\r<br />No. NMPP is just an adjustment to the Vanilla perks and doesn&#39;t rely on anything but the most current version of both Skyrim.esm and Update.esm. It has been tested on Skyrim 1.9.\r<br />\r<br />[b]What&#39;s with the weird Immersion section?[/b]\r<br />There&#39;s gotta be at least one person out there wondering this. I just wanted to give the mod a bit of lore-ish logic. The basic idea here is that when you absorb a soul, you&#39;re absorbing the Dragon&#39;s knowledge. There&#39;s no reason you couldn&#39;t absorb its knowledge of alchemy as opposed to its knowledge of Thumes. I&#39;m just making s*** up when it comes to the whole &#34;dragons absorb the knowledge of the humans they kill&#34; bit. So take it or leave it. Just a bit of fun, lol.\r<br />\r<br />[b][center]3 ---------------- Installation & Uninstallation ------------------[/center][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation:[/b]\r<br />Business as usual. Place the NoMorePickyPerks.esp file in your /skyrim/data folder or install it using the NMM. Easy-peasy.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Uninstallation:[/b]\r<br />Business as usual... in reverse.\r<br />\r<br />[b][center]4 ---------------- Best with... ------------------[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36812/?][i]&#34;Dragon Blood&#34;[/i] by DistinctlyMinty[/url]\r<br />\r<br />+\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18395/?][i]&#34;Ish&#39;s Souls to Perks&#34;[/i] by ishmaeltheforsaken and Oscar Wilde[/url]\r<br />\r<br />OR\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2063/?][i]&#34;Dragon Souls to Perks&#34;[/i] by NullCascade[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]5 ---------------- Bugs ------------------[/b][/center]\r<br />\r<br />This is a new mod for the moment. I&#39;ve tested this and I haven&#39;t seen any bugs per say. If anyone runs into trouble after installing this, please test to make sure it&#39;s my mod and if so, let me know. I&#39;ll see if I can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s up. Honestly, though, this is a SUPER simple mod and doesn&#39;t really do anything but remove some restrictions from the skill tree.\r<br />\r<br />THAT SAID: IF you have other skill tree mods that ADD new skills, this will have no effect on them. They will still have their level minimums. We&#39;ll just call those things stuff that people came up with after the dragons went to sleep for immersions&#39; sake. Changing your load order so that the other mods get dibs should prevent any of those perks from being overwritten by this set.\r<br />\r<br />[center]------------------------[/center]\r<br />\r<br />That&#39;s all, folks. Thanks for reading. If you like the mod, please endorse and all that. I&#39;ll be working on some new perk mods in the future for you guys. ",
