  "summary": "Just a simple mod that adds a couple of new animals into Riften",
  "descriptionHtml": "Adds 3 chickens, 2 dogs and 2 goats into the city of Riften. I thought it lacked in some domestic pets. Nothing exciting. This is also my very first mod so, if it\\'s buggy or messed up, I apologize, this is a new experience for me. Neither dog can be made a follower but if it gets requested enough I\\'ll tweak around with it. \r\n\r\nHARLEY - The guard dog, so to speak, of Riften. He is by the north gate, once you get inside he should be right there.\r\n\r\nJIMBLES - A stray that hangs around the market place.\r\n\r\nGRALK & EDDY - Two goats that hang out around the Thieves Guild entrance and the cemetary.\r\n\r\nSOME CHICKENS - Three chickens that are found usually by the orphanage.",
