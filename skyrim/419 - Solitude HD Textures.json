  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE 4/10/15\r<br />\r<br /> Apparently this mod was never truly made out of date by the 2KHD ones, so it&#39;s still useful (thanks for pointing this out, thiefmasque). I have removed the old message saying I won&#39;t do anything else with it to avoid confusion, but I still think that 2KHD adds some really high quality individual assets and think it&#39;s more than worth looking into.\r<br />\r<br />Also of note: the screenshots are from V1. The blue-looking stone wall tiles and the &#34;wet&#34; look of the ground in the final screenshot have since been fixed. I may at some point upload new screens, but rest assured that it doesn&#39;t actually look wonky.\r<br />\r<br />Updates or more textures may come in the coming months.\r<br />\r<br />--------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE 11/26/11\r<br />Uploaded new versions with original normal maps (at time of this writing, 2048x version still uploading), and a 1024x version, The originals don&#39;t have the overly bright issue, and add more depth, but don&#39;t have as much grain. I recommend the new ones, but if you really want the grain and shiny, you&#39;ll have to endure the 200mb download and the wood patch :P. Images are of the old version, but I&#39;ll put up some screens soon. The difference from the old one isn&#39;t huge. Some textures have been altered slightly aside from normal maps.\r<br />\r<br />Additionally, because the normal maps are the originals (512x) even the 2048x version should have less issues than the previous one with memory.\r<br />\r<br />Windows have not been edited yet.\r<br />---\r<br />\r<br />Almost every texture has been enhanced. If it wasn&#39;t enhanced, it wasn&#39;t included to save download time. An update may come that includes windows and the few other things that weren&#39;t changed, but in the meantime this will replace almost every one. They are mostly 4X the size of the originals (now 2048x2048), doors are 2X. Includes enhanced normal maps.\r<br />\r<br />To install, unpack this to your skyrim&gt;data folder. If you already have a texture mod, merging the texture folders will not mess with other files unless you already have new or unpacked Solitude textures.",
