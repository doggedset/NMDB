  "descriptionHtml": "[youtube]3KcsycfravU[/youtube] [youtube]ZBBe0fzwbqE[/youtube] [youtube]y0FTik3CYnE[/youtube]\r\nA blade fit for a king, the Kyneswarden was once carried by a priest of Kyne for which the blade is named. Long ago the Warden was tasked with protecting the world of men from the darker powers of the world. The blade is more effective against daedra, undead, vampires, and other unnatural creatures.\r\n\r\nIn terms of gameplay, the Kyneswarden is a unique one handed sword slightly stronger than ebony. The increased effectiveness against \\'unnatural creatures\\' is similar to Wuuthrad\\'s effectiveness against elves, so you can still add your own enchantment.\r\nThis mod also adds a new crafting recipe for Blade Oil which can be used on the sharpening wheel with the sword. I\\'ve never liked the requirement of vanilla weapons to add a whole brick of metal to sharpen the blade. If anything you\\'d be removing metal as you sharpen instead of adding a whole ingot. In your travels you\\'ll find Dwarven Oil which can be filtered through a Linen Wrap at the tanning rack to strain out impurities and produce Blade Oil which can then be used with the sharpening wheel to improve Kyneswarden.\r\n\r\nThe blade itself can be found in Eldergleam Sanctuary.",
