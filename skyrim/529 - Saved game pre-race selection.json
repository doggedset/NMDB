  "descriptionHtml": "This save places you seconds before you choose your race, saving you 5 precious minutes you could be using to kill dragons. No cheats or anything else stupid, just a save. Pray to the Night Mother for the construction kit to come out soon so somebody can make a mod to skip the intro completely!\r\n\r\nOn Windows 7 place the saved game in C:\\\\Users\\\\[Your User Name]\\\\Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Saves\r\nI don\\'t have Windows XP so I don\\'t know where it is located, although it will be somewhere under C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\[Your User Name]\r\n\r\nThe comments have spoken! The game will autosave for you at the same point, which I was not aware of, but the autosave will be overwritten if you don\\'t manually back it up.\r\n\r\n",
