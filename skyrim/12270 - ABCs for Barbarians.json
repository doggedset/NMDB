  "summary": "This mod converts the book ABCs for Barbarians from Morrowind to Skyrim, with updated scribbles to reflect the new items of Skyrim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Description\r<br />===========\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds the book &#34;ABCs for Barbarians&#34; (previously found in Morrowind) to Skyrim, with updated scribbles to reflect the new items of Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />The book is now available for sale from random vendors, and can also be found in random clutter.\r<br />\r<br />I also placed a unique dead barbarian with the book in the middle of Bleak Falls Barrow.  \r<br />\r<br />In keeping with the theme, the dead barbarian also has Frost Salts (from an Atronach), a Bee and Chaurus eggs in his inventory, but as barbarians don&#39;t have the attention span to get as far as &#34;D&#34;, he met his demise by a Draugr...\r<br />\r<br />I am no artist, but nobody else has created new art and I justify the poor art in-game as drawn by a barbarian - the book is created for and by barbarians.  Barbarians don&#39;t get any further with their ABCs before being distracted by a good fight.\r<br />\r<br />This book is also a modders resource - can be used in your own mods with notification and appropriate credit.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Change Log:\r<br />===========\r<br />\r<br />v1.0\r<br />(25/04/2013 19:47:20)\r<br />- added to correct leveled lists (book was not appearing in lists correctly in previous version - now added to cheap book list and clutter book list)\r<br />- added facegen data for dead barbarian to prevent gray face issue\r<br />- cleaned mod in TES5Edit\r<br />- tweaked scribble on Bee&#39;s leg\r<br />- archived assets as BSA file\r<br />\r<br />v0.2 \r<br />(07/03/2012 14:02:50)\r<br />- Original release\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />=============\r<br />\r<br />Use NMM to install, or manually place &#34;ABCs for Barbarians.esp&#34; and &#34;ABCs for Barbarians.bsa&#34; into your data directory.\r<br />\r<br />If updating from v0.2, remove loose files installed with the previous version - if previously installed via NMM simply deactivate and uninstall the old version, then install and activate the new version.  If previously installed manually, browse to textures&#92;clutter&#92;books&#92;images in your Skyrim data directory and remove &#34;a&#34;, &#34;b&#34; and &#34;c&#34; images.  It is not necessary to remove these, but cleaner to do so - plus I&#39;ve tidied up the scribble on one of the Bee&#39;s legs.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />===============\r<br />\r<br />Use NMM to uninstall, or remove &#34;ABCs for Barbarians.esp&#34; and &#34;ABCs for Barbarians.bsa&#34; from your data directory.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />==============\r<br />\r<br />This mod is compatible with the vast majority of mods.  \r<br />If you use any mod which changes vendor book lists then for this book to appear for sale you need this mod to be later in your load order, or use Wrye Bash to merge the lists.\r<br />Alternatively you can give preference to your other mod (and not see this book for sale) but still find this book on the body of the barbarian found in Bleak Falls Barrow.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Licensing\r<br />=========\r<br />If using the book or art in another mod, a credit and notification would be appreciated.\r<br />This artwork is not permitted for commercial use.\r<br />May not be used in paid mods without prior written consent.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Other suggested mods you may be interested in by the same author\r<br />================================================================\r<br />\r<br />Goodnight Mundus - [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34673]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34673[/url].  Adds the book &#34;Goodnight Mundus&#34; (a book released in video form by the developers of Elder Scrolls Online) to the game.\r<br />Advanced Shrines - [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21349]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21349[/url].  Adds the possibility of receiving better blessings - or none at all&#33;  Chances of getting a successful blessing at a shrine now depends on whether you follow the teachings of that divine, how much gold (if any) you choose to donate, and also sheer chance&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Other suggested mods:\r<br />======================\r<br />For those interested, Skinripper has made a volume 2 of the book to accompany this mod - available at [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31699]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31699[/url]",
