  "descriptionHtml": "[u]FemFeet - Female Foot Replacement Mod - by Phygit[/u]\r<br />\r<br />[u]Details:[/u]\r<br />This package contains new mesh(es) to replace the default/boxy feet on females with something more resembling real feet w/toes.\r<br />\r<br />The feet are (mesh) compatible with the default female body - as well as the CBBE mod body(s).  However the default female textures (and current CBBE textures) are not compatible - check back for links to compatible textures as they become available.\r<br />\r<br />[some quick-n-dirty &#34;sample&#34; textures for the default mesh are included (now based on Thepal&#39;s NUDE FEMALE textures) - see the Notes section below for details]\r<br />\r<br />[u]Release notes:[/u]\r<br />- v3.0\r<br />There was an issue making it difficult for texture-creators to hide the UV-seam between the feet -&gt; shin (as well as other seams).  I am always hesitant to make new UV-mapping changes, but I felt like it was worth one final change...\r<br />\r<br />********************************************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />NOTE: The uv-mapping has changed with this version (for the last time)...textures designed for the v2.0+ feet will need to be adjusted.\r<br />********************************************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />\r<br />...with that out of the way, I decided that since the UVs were changing anyway, I&#39;d go ahead and make a few other adjustments...\r<br />\r<br />+ UV-mapping seam between the feet -&gt; shins can now be easily hidden.\r<br />+ UV-mapping seam that runs down the inside of the foot/ankle can also now be easily hidden.\r<br />+ Adjusted the UV-mapping seam between the sole and upper foot (the one that splits every toe) so that it&#39;s lower on the foot/toes... it&#39;s still difficult to hide that seam without a 3D Paint program, but it&#39;s less obvious now.\r<br />+ Moved a polygon-row of the toenail underside UV-mapping to the top-side.\r<br />+ Split the underside toenail mapping from the top-side and enlarged and straightened the nail mapping.\r<br />+ The &#39;heavy&#39; (_1) foot shape was tweeked somewhat.\r<br />+ &#34;Wedding Dress&#34; sandals were added to this release (NOTE: there is a known issue when your character is set to something between Light and Heavy weight settings (the bottom of the sandals get scrambled).  I will try to fix this in a future (mesh/.nif only) update).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />- v2.2\r<br />&#34;Falmer Boots&#34; mesh replacement now included.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />- v2.1\r<br />Fixes a slight foot-&gt;shin gap with the &#34;heavy&#34; setting (femalefeet_1.nif is only file that changed) - no changes to v2.0+ uv-mapping.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />- v2.0\r<br />watshisface pointed out that I failed to account for the Khajit / Argonian &#34;tail&#34; mapping (the feet uv-mapping spilled over top of the tail uv-mapping).\r<br />So...\r<br />\r<br />********************************************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />NOTE: The uv-mapping has changed with this version (hopefully for the last time)...textures designed for the v1.0 feet will (likely) need to be adjusted.\r<br />********************************************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />\r<br />..I also made the big-toe a bit slimmer.\r<br />\r<br />- v1.0\r<br />First release\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]Compatible Texture Mods:[/u]\r<br />Calientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition -CBBE- by Caliente - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666 (may need to be updated to use v3.0+ uv-mapping).\r<br />\r<br />-CBBE- with Female feet Textures by aknot - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3685 (may need to be updated to use v3.0+ uv-mapping).\r<br />\r<br />- Skeuomorph CBBE Slim V2 Nethers by Skeuomorph - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4254 (may need to be updated to use v3.0+ uv-mapping).\r<br />\r<br />- Athletic Nude Women - CBBE by Valstein0 - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=563 (includes a v2.x copy of my foot mod, with v2.x compatible textures for both CBBE and default bodies... don&#39;t install my v3.0 feet unless you alter the textures to match).\r<br />\r<br />- XCE - Xenius Character Enhancement by Xenius - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2356 (includes [u]v3.0+ uv-mapped feet[/u] (yay&#33;) from my mod, along with textures for default and/or CBBE models).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]Contents:[/u]\r<br />These are the replacement mesh files for the character feet...\r<br />Datameshesactorscharactercharacter assetsfemalefeet_0.nif\r<br />Datameshesactorscharactercharacter assetsfemalefeet_1.nif\r<br />\r<br />Falmer Boots foot replacement (will use whatever textures you already have installed)...\r<br />Datameshesarmorfalmerfalmerbootsf_0.nif\r<br />Datameshesarmorfalmerfalmerbootsf_1.nif\r<br />\r<br />Wedding Dress Sandals replacement...\r<br />Datameshesclothesweddingdresssandalsf_0.nif\r<br />Datameshesclothesweddingdresssandalsf_1.nif\r<br />\r<br />These are some &#34;sample&#34; textures...\r<br />Datatexturesactorscharacterfemalefemalebody_1.dds\r<br />Datatexturesactorscharacterfemalefemalebody_1_msn.dds\r<br />\r<br />Available as a _separate_ download are some modder-resource files (all are 4096x4096)...\r<br />femalebody_1.psd - a layered .psd file of the above, that includes the uv-template for the new feet.\r<br />femalebody_1_msn.psd - a layered .psd file used to create the normal map.\r<br />leg_foot_seam_fix_4k.psd - a layered .psd file that shows a 2D painting method for fixing seams.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]Installation:[/u]\r<br />As mentioned above, these new feet will require updated (full body) textures, which means you&#39;ll need to check back to see if your favorite body textures have been updated to be compatible with this mod. If you want to use the &#34;sample&#34; (crappy) textures in the meantime, simply copy the (entire) Data folder to your ..SteamSteamAppscommonskyrim folder, so that you end up with:\r<br />\r<br />..SteamSteamAppscommonskyrimDatameshesactorscharactercharacter assetsfemalefeet_0.nif\r<br />..SteamSteamAppscommonskyrimDatameshesactorscharactercharacter assetsfemalefeet_1.nif\r<br />..SteamSteamAppscommonskyrimDatameshesarmorfalmerfalmerbootsf_0.nif\r<br />..SteamSteamAppscommonskyrimDatameshesarmorfalmerfalmerbootsf_1.nif\r<br />..SteamSteamAppscommonskyrimDatameshesclothesweddingdresssandalsf_0.nif\r<br />..SteamSteamAppscommonskyrimDatameshesclothesweddingdresssandalsf_1.nif\r<br />\r<br />..SteamSteamAppscommonskyrimDatatexturesactorscharacterfemalefemalebody_1.dds\r<br />..SteamSteamAppscommonskyrimDatatexturesactorscharacterfemalefemalebody_1_msn.dds\r<br />\r<br />...if you already have compatible textures (or can keep your shoes on until you get some), you should only copy the Datameshes folder to your ..SteamSteamAppscommonskyrimData folder\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]Uninstallation:[/u]\r<br />Delete the *.nif files listed above, from the locations mentioned above (you&#39;ll also need to delete or swap out your textures).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]Notes:[/u]\r<br />- As mentioned above, the sample textures are just that - a stand-in/sample/place-holder (don&#39;t bother telling me any issues with the textures)\r<br />- An optional download contains a layered .pdf file that was used to mix together the sample normal map and also includes a uv-template.\r<br />\r<br />...a recommendation for anyone doing textures... try not to add any &#39;shadowing&#39; in your textures (like between the toes) the normal map\r<br />and game lighting should take care of that and it&#39;ll be less trouble to deal with any potential uv-mapping changes and/or morphing (&#39;skin wrinkle&#39;\r<br />type details should be fine). The same goes for the skin &#39;under&#39; the toenails... while the current normal map has shading for the cuticle area,\r<br />if someone flattens that out and moves the nails (turns them into claws, protruding from the ends of the toes), your texture will still work if\r<br />you didn&#39;t add &#39;toenail&#39; details there.\r<br />\r<br />[u]FAQ:[/u]\r<br />Q: Will these feet work for males?\r<br />A: No.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Any plans for male feet?\r<br />A: I&#39;ll investigate that when I have time.  Meanwhile, you are welcome to use the extracted mesh files as a basis for a male-foot mod (hopefully keeping the uv-mapping the same).\r<br />\r<br />Q: Any plans for Khajit / Argonian feet w/claws?\r<br />A: The problem for non-human characters is... currently (unless/until someone figures it out or it&#39;s possible once the CK comes out), the game only/always uses a single foot mesh for all races. In other words, if the feet had claws, ALL of your female characters (and shoeless female NPCs) would have clawed feet. \r<br />\r<br />Q: Is this mod compatible with ~insert-my-favorite-texture-mod-here~ ?\r<br />A: As stated at the top of this description, it is _mesh_ compatible with the default and/or (current) CBBE figures, but the textures are _not_ compatible, until/unless adjustments are made to those textures (either by the original artist or others).\r<br />\r<br />Q: Will these feet show up in various open-toed-armor/sandals?\r<br />A: Not until/unless someone comes out with a mod for those models that uses this mesh.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Are these feet compatible with the TnT_BodyShop mod?\r<br />A: A version of these feet are (now) included with that mod, but they decided not to use my uv-mapping, so you&#39;ll have to use textures designed for that mod (the body may also use different-than-standard uv-mapping, so you likely need textures designed for that body anyway).  The point is... if you&#39;re using that mod, you should use the feet/textures that come with it (or that are made for it).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u]Credits:[/u]\r<br />Modeling / uv-mapping: Phygit\r<br />Texture Base: The latest version now includes textures based on &#34;NUDE FEMALES&#34; resource files by Thepal (http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=70)\r<br />Conversion to .nif:    XunAmarox, Caliente, 2pac4eva7, Phygit (depending on versions...)\r<br />Assistance/testing:    2pac4eva7, Thor925\r<br />Compatible Textures: Anyone who makes them.\r<br />",
