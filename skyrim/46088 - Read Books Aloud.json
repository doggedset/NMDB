After support for a book is added, by a all-in-one or separate plugin, a audio file / voice pack will have to be created by a talented voice actor / actress, which you will need to download and install.\r<br />\r<br />New support for books can be continuously added over time. The system is designed to be extremely flexible; you will be able to download &#34;Voice Collections&#34; from a single voice actor, or recordings of individual books. You will be able to pick and choose who to listen to on a book-by-book basis.\r<br />\r<br />For the moment is switching which actor you are listening to in-game not supported. The &#34;install what you want&#34; system offers the highest level of compatibility and flexibility while also keeping the configuration in-game very simple.\r<br /> \r<br />[b][color=yellow]How does RBA work:[/color][/b]\r<br />I will skip the technical details for now.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]Installation & Activation:[/color][/b]\r<br />There are 3 parts to installing and using Read Books Aloud with working Audio Books.\r<br />\r<br />1: Install “Read Books Aloud”\r<br />2: Install “Audio Books Files”\r<br />3: Install “Support Plugin”\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]How to add Support:[/color][/b]\r<br />See included tutorial\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]What is not Supported:[/color][/b]\r<br />•\tBooks that already have a script applied to them\r<br />( Adding a script to a object that already has a script would not be smart )\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]How to add AudioBooks:[/color][/b]\r<br />See included tutorial\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]Features:[/color][/b]\r<br />•\tSkyUI MCM Support: Required primarily to easily allow the player to set playback controls, in English only. SkyUI also requires SKSE.\r<br />•\tPlayback controls: Play, Stop, Next Section, Previous Section. SkyUI MCM also requires SKSE.\r<br />•\tOption: Toggleable Auto-Start: Whether or not books will start being read to you automatically, or wait until you press your configured Play button.\r<br />•\tOption: Keep Reading after Book Close: You can turn an option on to allow you to keep the recording playing after you close the book, so you can listen while you adventure.\r<br />•\tSupports all Readable Content: Books, letters, notes, and scrolls including from DLC and mods.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]Requirements:[/color][/b]\r<br />•\tSKSE ( Skyrim Script Extender v1.06.16 )\r<br />•\tSkyUI ( Skyrim User Interface mod v4.1 )\r<br />•\tTES5Edit ( Skyrim Plugin Editor v3.0.31 )\r<br />•\tAudioBooks ( Audio files for supported books )\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]AudioBooks:[/color][/b]\r<br />•\tSkyrim ( by Sjors Boomschors )\r<br />•\tHearthFires ( by Sjors Boomschors )\r<br />•\tDawnguard ( by Sjors Boomschors )\r<br />•\tDragonborn ( by Sjors Boomschors )\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]Incompatible:[/color][/b]\r<br />•\tWith all mods that edit books\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]Limitations:[/color][/b]\r<br />•\tDue to a TES5Edit limitation is it impossible to automatically add AudioBook support to a book that already has a script added to it. It has to be done manually in the Creation Kit. Lucky for us not allot of books have scripts added to them.\r<br />•\tDue to a Creation Kit limitation it is impossible to link to .xwm audio files. The use of .xwm audio files is highly recomended due to its very high compression ratio. TES5Edit is needed to set the correct patch.\r<br />•\tBooks containing game specific input (so called dynamic book) will not make good audio books. Its imposible to know what content should be spoken, like dynamic Player, NPC and locations names.\r<br />•\tThe TES5Edit script only adds support to books with only 1 audio file (1 section), Read Books Aloud can support upto 30 sections if needed.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]Bugs:[/color][/b]\r<br />•\tVolume is be lower in third-person view then in first-person view\r<br />•\tIt is posible to have more then one book being read to you at the same time\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]Credits:[/color][/b]\r<br />•\tChesko the original Creator\r<br />•\tSjors Boomschors mod modifier\r<br />•\tZilav For TES5Edit script and support\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Thanks for reading, and let me know what you think.\r<br />I love to receive feedback, bugreports and suggestions.",
