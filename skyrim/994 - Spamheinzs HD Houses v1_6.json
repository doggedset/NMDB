  "descriptionHtml": "Spamheinz\\'s HD Farmhouse\r\n\r\nI decided to make the 1.6 mipmapped version the main file. Without going into much technical jadajada, this file loads a lot faster and is virtually the same in fps.\r\n\r\nriverun load times:\r\nwith mipmaps it was 11-15s on my machine\r\nwithout it was 18-20s\r\n\r\nSo i strongly re-come the mipmapped version for you guys.\r\nthe 1024px version is also now mipmapped. \r\n\r\n\r\nReleased the 1024px version for slower pcs, hope it runs well for you!\r\nI left one file with double res in so the woodposts look better.\r\nTell me how it runs!\r\n\r\nversion 1.6\r\nfixed the version with mipmaps, some transparency and shininess issues should be gone now.\r\nOther version without mipmaps is fine, no need to download that one again :)\r\n\r\nVersion 1.5:\r\nAfter 2 days working and figuring stuff out i have finally been able to improve the roof texture and the woodposts. Seen everywhere. check the screens :)\r\nAll new roof with normal maps, also the infamous woodpost seen blurry all over skyrim has been reworked.\r\n\r\nSorry about the confusion with the nexus mod manager, something seemd to break in the 1.5 with the new mod manager sending nmm to crash and popup errors. It IS fixed now with the different files. \r\n\r\n\r\nStrongly recommed to use a 4gb patch with these, the texture&normal maps are bigger then the 2048px version before. woodpost is even 4096px.\r\n\r\nI was an adventurere like you, but then i took a woodpost to the knee... :-)\r\n\r\nchanges v1.1:\r\n\r\n1024px version\r\n1.1 optimized texture format\r\n\r\n2048px version\r\n1.1 optimized texture format\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the help of my fellow modders:\r\nchris2012, NebuLa1\r\n\r\nFor people having trouble with crashes chris2012 had the following advise:\r\n\r\nMost likely you\\'ll need the \\\"allow 4gb ram usage\\\" patch to allow skyrim to use more RAM otherwise you\\'ll encounter purple textures/crashes -> you can find it here : http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1013\r\n\r\nYou might also try the 1024px version.\r\n\r\nBe sure to check out chris great whiterun texture mod:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=114\r\n\r\nAnd nebula1s hd skyrim:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=607\r\n\r\nThis mod will work with the whiterun mod and hd skyrim without problems.\r\n____________________________\r\n\r\nHi,\r\nThis is the up-scaled&edited Version of the Farmhouses.\r\nMaybe saying Farmhouse is a bit misleading, this includes all mills, stone walls, mead ins, common houses, Miller, Farmer, Smiths and more. These textures get used almost everywhere, as dock piers, walls, wood planks etc.\r\n\r\nThats why I took great care to build them up in the same style, colour and shade with higher resolution.\r\nIt Took me several days but here it is, enjoy and endorse if you like it.\r\n\r\nWhiterun Mod compatibly! This mod won\\'t interfere with that other great texture mod.\r\n\r\nThere are two versions avaible; \r\nthe 2048px Highres 1.0 with all new normal&colour maps and\r\nthe 1024px lowres 1.0 with optimized normal maps (halfsize).\r\n\r\nShould suite everyones pc.\r\n\r\nI also have an insane version with 4096px resolution in the works. Stay tuned!\r\n\r\nFeel free to modify and comment! Feedback makes me do more mods! :)\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\nHow to install:\r\nExtract the zip file to the Skyrim\\\\Data folder,\r\nor use Nexus Mod Manager!\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\nSimply delete these all files (18 in version 1.0) from:\r\nSkyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\architecture\\\\farmhouse\r\n\r\n\r\nNexus Mod Manager compatible.\r\n\r\nContact: Spamheinz@web.de",
