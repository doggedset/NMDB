Well, I set out to change this, since I love playing as a bard.\r<br />\r<br />Here is a video with comparisons. The first three songs are vanilla, and the other three are the modded ones. \r<br />\r<br />[youtube]74WrkBpUCkM[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />I personally think the modded songs are a lot more authentic and believable. \r<br />\r<br />Bendir music by Eren Ergen, recorded by Barisbozkurt at Freesound.org - common [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usul_(music)]usul[/url] of Ottoman music: [url=http://www.freesound.org/people/barisbozkurt/sounds/140548/]Aksak Semai[/url], [url=http://www.freesound.org/people/barisbozkurt/sounds/140395/]Curcuna[/url], and [url=http://www.freesound.org/people/barisbozkurt/sounds/140292/]Yürük Semai[/url]. \r<br />\r<br />These songs are licensed under the Attribution Noncommercial License, which gives users permission to copy, distribute and transmit the work as long as credit is given and there is no commercial use.\r<br />\r<br />To install, place the files in your &#39;SteamSteamAppsCommonSkyrimData&#39; folder. If you want to get rid of them, delete the files from skyrimDatasoundfxmusbarddrum.\r<br />\r<br />Take a look [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35248]here[/url] for a replacement for the lute tunes. And if you are looking for a replacement for flutes, I&#39;d recommend [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4149]Bard Flute Music - Touhou[/url] by JackDigital. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
