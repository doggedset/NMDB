  "descriptionHtml": "My second mod, I\\'m getting a little better at this modding business.  Some people requested I do an immersive marriage/adoption mod for Daighre and her daughter Erith in Left Hand Mine so here we are,  filled with even more cheesy dialogue than my Carlotta Valentia mod :)\r\n\r\nThis mod adds adds an immersive way to marry Daighre in the Left Hand Mine in Markarth and adopt her daughter Erith.\r\n\r\nDaighre doesn\\'t give her spouse a set of her keys after the wedding or allow him to go inside her home so the player needs to talk to her after the wedding to fix that. The player can also give Daighre a plain green dress (sorry but you can\\'t pick which dress) which removes her miner clothes and pickaxe. The dog Torom follows Erith, I didn\\'t make any changes to the dog in this mod but he follows Erith to the players home so they are still together.\r\n\r\n - Requires Hearthfire.\r\n\r\nTo initiate the additional dialogue :\r\n - Complete regular marriage pre-requisites.\r\n - Must own a home with a free childrens bed.\r\n - Clear the Kolskeggr mine (for the best immersion speak to Daighre right after getting the Kolskeggr quest and before you clear it).\r\n - After the player has married Daighre he needs to talk to Erith to officially adopt her.\r\n\r\nRecommended actions :\r\n -- The newlyweds should move to the Players home and NOT Daighre\\'s home --\r\n -- The dialogue to get her house keys should be finished directly after choosing a home --\r\n\r\nChangelog :\r\n\r\n 0.2 / 19.9.2013\r\n  * Initial public release\r\n  * Added an immersive dialogue that changes Daighre\\'s clothes and removes her pickaxe.\r\n\r\n 0.1 :\r\n  * Private first release\r\n\r\nAuthor : Sicarius100",
