  "descriptionHtml": "[b]DESCRIPTION:[/b]\r<br />Scripted troll for damage and DPS metering. Can be used to compare different weapons or attack strategies. What is better: Legendary Zephyr or good old fireball? Try them on DPS Troll.\r<br />First version is as simple as possible. No changes to vanilla records or side effects.\r<br />\r<br />[b]USAGE:[/b]\r<br />1. Copy files to your Data folder.\r<br />2. Find your troll right behind the &#34;Bannered Mare&#34; in Whiterun.\r<br />3. Attack the troll for 8 seconds&#33;\r<br />4. Read troll&#39;s report. It includes damage values for every second of the test and average DPS.\r<br />5. After a few seconds, troll will be ready for new test.\r<br />\r<br />[b]NOTES:[/b]\r<br />- As any troll, this one receives 150% of fire damage.\r<br />- DPS is affected by game difficulty. And there is no way to determine difficulty from mod without SKSE. Keep that in mind if you want to compare your results with somebody.\r<br />- First version. Please report bugs and troll&#39;s suspicious activity.\r<br />- Troll will return to his original position after changing location or waiting (&#34;T&#34; key).\r<br />- Sorry for my english. If you want to fix my spelling, please send me corrected version,\r<br />\r<br />[b]SION&#39;S CODE:[/b]\r<br />All my mods/programs are safe to try and safe to delete at any moment. Vanilla records are changed only if there is no other way. Maximum performance and compatibility.\r<br />",
