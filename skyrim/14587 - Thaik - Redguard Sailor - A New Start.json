  "descriptionHtml": "You\\'re a sailor from Stros M\\'kai. You wake up in a wreck of a ship, near Winterhold. All of your friends were drowned or dead. Everything is frozen. You don\\'t have anything but ragged clothes, a steel dagger and an iron sword. Suddenly, you hear a terrifying sound - sound of a dragon! It\\'s circling around the wreck of the ship. You are taking your equipments from chest nearby and starting to walk outside and you see a dragon. Will you run, or kill it? It\\'s your choice.\r\n\r\n*You are Dragonborn but you don\\'t know anything about Helgen incident.\r\n*If you kill the dragon, you will absorb its soul and seek for explanation of this.\r\n*You\\'re a middle-aged Redguard, and your one eye is blind.\r\n*Outside of the ship, a frost-dragon awaits you.\r\n*Closest town is Winterhold.\r\n*I recommend to play in Expert difficulty.",
