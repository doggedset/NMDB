  "summary": "Crude tool for killing actors (dragons in particular) outside console targeting range.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The aim of this mod is to supply a quick and easy way to kill actors that are too far away to target with the console. The solution I came up with is fantastically simple and extremely crude: A thunderbolt called Zeus&#39; Bolt with 1,000,000 damage, accompanied by a ring with fortify destruction 100% (which I then figured out wasn&#39;t needed, but what the hell.)\r<br />Anyway, it turns out this solution will level your destruction skill something crazy, and I then realized you can activate tgm and walk up to the OP modded dragons that prompted the creation of this mod in the first place, but I&#39;ve noticed a general lack of op damagers in the cheats category (my first idea was that someone had already made this - they hadn&#39;t), so I figured I might as well upload. \r<br />Location: Belathor&#39;s desk. He decided he owns them, so you&#39;ll have to knock them onto the floor or toggle his detection off or use the bucket trick.\r<br />Enjoy or whatever. I don&#39;t really care.\r<br />",
