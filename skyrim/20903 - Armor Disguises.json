  "descriptionHtml": "~Version 1.6~\r\n\r\n*This is likely the final version of Armor Disguises, I have done all I wanted to do with this mod, and it is now fully functional.*\r\n\r\nAttention All: Still looking for reviews, I\\'ve got a couple but more are welcome.\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re still having problems with Armor Disguises working, move it to the bottom of your mod load order. If you don\\'t know what this does, look it up. \r\n\r\nIntroduction:\r\n----------------\r\n      Have you ever wanted to return to Whiterun after a murdering spree without getting arrested?  Or maybe you wanted to live with the Bandits for a month? Well now you can, with Armor Disguises.  Armor Disguises is a mod that spawned from the latest of my many assassin characters and Fallout New Vegas.  For those of you that are not familiar, New Vegas implemented a system that would allow players to disguise themselves as a member of a main quest faction by wearing its members\\' armor.  Using scripts, this mod does more or less that.\r\n\r\nCurrent Factions:\r\n----------------------\r\nThe following Factions are presently included in Armor Disguises:\r\n     Bandits\r\n     Forsworn\r\n     Warlocks and Necromancers\r\n     Guards*\r\n     Imperials and Stormcloaks\r\n     Thalmor\r\n    \r\n*Note: In order for guard armor to work the player needs to leave the cell, wait at least 24 game hours, and equip either the helmet or the cuirass last, the boots or gauntlets last will not trigger the disguise.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n------------\r\nThe following features are presently in the mod:\r\n     Wear ALL pieces of a Faction\\'s armor to be disguised as a member (i.e. wear all fur armor to be disguised as a Bandit)\r\n     Armor can be equipped in any order (except for guard armor, see note above)\r\n     Racial Requirements for the Forsworn (Breton) and the Thalmor (High Elf)\r\n     A basic perk required to disguise at all\r\n     A higher level perk to bypass the Racial Requirements\r\n     Multiple Player attacks to cause NPCs to be hostile to the Player again\r\n     Attacking any enemy will cause the Player to be removed from the faction and attacked on sight\r\n     The player can re-disguise once out of combat and undetected**\r\n     Trying to disguise while already in combat will not end combat\r\n     Removing any piece of armor will cause hostile NPCs to attack and Guards to arrest criminals in their hold.\r\n     For the Necromancers, the Warlocks, and the Thalmor: Players need to wear the hooded variant of their robes in order to be disguised\r\n     \r\n**Note: After re-disguising, if the enemy the player initially assaulted is alive, they will not be friendly\r\n\r\nReviews\r\n-------------------------\r\n[url=http://skyrimmodsandmore.blogspot.com/2012/12/mod-armor-disguises.html]Skyrim Mods and More[/url]\r\n[youtube]pmYnBlrn9ug[/youtube]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimgems.com/index.html][img]http://i.imgur.com/1wXSO.png[/img][/url]\r\n       \r\nUpcoming Features:\r\n-------------------------\r\nI am planning on adding the following features when I have time (assuming they are possible):\r\n    Bug fixes (if necessary)\r\n    Other than that, nothing.\r\n\r\nConflicts:\r\n-----------\r\nAny mod that changes the Stealth Perk Tree will mess with the Master of Disguise Perk, this is easily avoidable so long as Armor Disguises is lower in the load order than the other mod.\r\n\r\nBugs:\r\n-------\r\nNone\r\n     \r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n----------------\r\nTwo options on the Nexus:\r\n1) Use the Nexus Mod Manager (Do it...) (No Really, Do it)\r\n2) Download Manually\r\n\r\nNMM\r\n1) Click Download with NMM\r\n2) Once the download is done, enable the mod in the Manager\r\n\r\nManual\r\n1) Click Manual Download\r\n2) Once it is done, open the files with a program such as 7zip or Winrar (Personally I use 7zip)\r\n3) Extract the files to the \\\\Skyrim\\\\Data folder, where ever it may be\r\n4) Make sure the .esp file is checked when opening the regular Skyrim Launcher (not SKSE)\r\n\r\nVersion 1.6 \r\n-------------- \r\nChanges: \r\n-------------- \r\nCleaned the mod using TES5Edit \r\nFixed possible bugs\r\n\r\nVersion 1.5\r\n--------------\r\nChanges:\r\n--------------\r\nAdded a Racial Requirement system\r\nAdded Perk Disguise Artist to Stealth tree\r\nAdjusted Master of Disguise\r\nAdjusted Perks so that they function correctly\r\nRemoved Penitus Oculatus Disguises\r\nAdded removal from faction on Player Hostility\r\n\r\nVersion 1.3\r\n--------------\r\nChanges:\r\n--------------\r\nAdded a Perk requirement System\r\nAdded Perk Master of Disguise to Stealth tree\r\nRemoved Higher up Stormcloak/Imperial armor for disguises (Only Imperial Light and basic Stormcloak armors work now)\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2 \r\n--------------\r\nChanges:\r\n--------------\r\nAdded requirement for all armor pieces\r\nRemoved Dwarven Armor disguises for now\r\nRemoved Elven Armor for Thalmor\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n--------------\r\nChanges:\r\n--------------\r\nFixed the Stormcloak and Imperial bug, and gave the two factions the testing they deserved.\r\nAdded Warlock Disguises\r\nAdded Penitus Oculatus Disguises, still in the middle of testing though\r\nAdded support for Followers, however when I was testing they didn\\'t seem to need disguises\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
