  "descriptionHtml": "-- Basic Details --\r<br />\r<br />Mod Name: Realistic Weight and Value\r<br />Mod Author: Ninjakreborn (Joyel Puryear - http://www.joyelpuryear.com)\r<br />Business Site: http://www.infotechnologist.biz\r<br />\r<br />-- Mod Specifics --\r<br />\r<br />Description: This mod simply redoes the weight/value of several items in the game to make them more\r<br />realistic, and in some cases more manageable.\r<br />\r<br />Specific Changes: The overall goal of this mod is to modify the weight/value of everything, as well \r<br />\r<br />as taking posted feedback into account, to achieve the most realistic weight and value amounts for \r<br />\r<br />each item, without being annoying to the user as well.  It&#39;s hard to come up with a full list of \r<br />\r<br />things that were modified, so the list below tries to cover the basics, but may not be entirely \r<br />\r<br />accurate.\r<br />\r<br />- Modified many basic items (Plates, forks, bowls, pots, pans, and so forth).\r<br />- Modified several of the annoying items (burnt books and so forth).\r<br />- Modified pricing on some of the more rare/exotic items. A good example is Werewolf hide. It \r<br />\r<br />should be worth more because it&#39;s so hard to find, among other items.\r<br />- Modified soul gem values/weights.  This may not be entirely... realistic yet. I just did a first \r<br />\r<br />draft of revisions. In a future release I will carefully redo weight/value of all of the gems, so \r<br />\r<br />feedback is appreciated.\r<br />- Adjusted the sizing of the Ysgramore&#39;s blade fragments slightly to what a fragment would weigh \r<br />\r<br />realistically.  \r<br />- Other random weight/value changes and adjustments.\r<br />\r<br />Conflicts: There should be none.\r<br />\r<br />Install: Just install it like any other mod. Add the esp into data folder, and turn it on. I \r<br />\r<br />recommend Nexus Mod Manager for it.\r<br />\r<br />Update: Just disable the old app, uninstall it, then install the new app. Recommended to use the \r<br />\r<br />Nexus Mod Manager to uninstall the old one, and install the new one.\r<br />\r<br />Feedback: This is my first Skyrim mod. I definitely need feedback on it on how to improve it, and \r<br />\r<br />change requests.\r<br />\r<br />-- Release History -- \r<br />\r<br />Version 1.3\r<br />\r<br />- Adjusted weight and value of horse hide, wolf pelt, werewolf pelt, goat hide, Sabrecat Pelt, Sabrecat Snot Pelt, Deer hides and \r<br />\r<br />pelts.\r<br />- Adjusted values on the pots.\r<br />- Adjusted weight and value for human troll skull.\r<br />- Adjusted weight and value of the burned book.\r<br />- Adjust value of dragon scales/bones.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.0\r<br />\r<br />- Initial release version.\r<br />",
