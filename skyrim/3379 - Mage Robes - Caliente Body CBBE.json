  "descriptionHtml": "Description:\r\n\r\n\tFirst, I would like to send a big thank you to Gilead Maerlyn and Caliente for letting me use there mods as part of this one!  If you like this mod make sure to check those out their mods (if you haven\\'t already) since they did most of the work that went into this mod.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tGilead Maerlyn\\'s Summer Fashion: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1384\r\n\t\tCaliente\\'s CBBE Body Mod: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\n\t\r\n\tThis mod makes the Novice, Apprentice, and Adept Mage Robes compatible with the Caliente Body mod.  These are fairly revealing, which helps reduce clipping since I\\'m not proficient with Blender, and people seem to like it that way anyways ;)\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\n\tGilead Maerlyn\\'s Summer Fashion - required (my mod will replace several files of this mod)\r\n\tCaliente\\'s CBBE Body Mod - not technically required, but why get this if you don\\'t have it?\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\n\tThis mod has several options for installation.  You will need to choose one of the Meshes folders to intall and one of the Textures folders.  In the end your file structure should look like this:\r\n\t\r\n\tC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Textures\\\\clothes\\\\mageapprentice\\\\f\\\\robe\r\n\tC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Textures\\\\clothes\\\\mageapprentice\\\\f\\\\robe_variant1\r\n\tC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Textures\\\\clothes\\\\mageapprentice\\\\f\\\\robe_variant2\r\n\tC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Meshes\\\\clothes\\\\mageapprentice\\\\mageapprenticerobesf_0\r\n\tC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Meshes\\\\clothes\\\\mageapprentice\\\\mageapprenticerobesf_1\r\n\t\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\n\tGilead Maerlyn for the Summer Fashion mod\r\n\tCaliente for CBBE",
