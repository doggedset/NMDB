But also, knowing what mods conflict with each other is important too.\r<br />Read the mod before installing, most mods have requirements and what they are and are not compatible with.\r<br />BOSS and LOOT are very helpful in auto-sorting known mod groups.&#34;\r<br />Credit to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1316352]Quinten Wolfe[/url] for summing that up as I forgot to mention that in the video.
