  "descriptionHtml": "Welcome!\r\n\r\nFirst off I wanna give a shout out to HeliosDoubleSix for his [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4142] ENB HD6 Lighting Enhancement Mod[/url]. That\\'s what inspired me to make my own.\r\n\r\nWhat I was going for here was a middle ground between trying to make it look realistic and yet keep a fantasy setting. I guess I\\'m just tired of everyone saying their mods are realistic yet so many of them are different and we all have our own tastes right? Well this is my preference for how I want Skyrim to look.\r\n\r\nThis is meant to be played with SSAO on and is on by default the settings are not intensive at all in SSAO as I know SSAO can be a huge performance hit on all PCs. I also added in an FXAA Post-Process Injector for very little post sharpening (no pre-sharpen as that tends to be overkill) and I used the tonemap in it as well. Your in-game brightness should be set at default (middle) as well. I also wanted my fire\\'s to look well more like flames and not white so you will see a lot of orange in the flame but not like hot orange or anything. I\\'ll let most of my screens do the talking I guess and you can determine for yourself if you want to give it a go.\r\n\r\n||Installation||\r\n\r\nTo install extract everything in the archive to the C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\ directory.\r\nI included my skyrim.ini and skyrimprefs.ini to help you adjust to exactly how my screens look.\r\n\r\nYou need to set these settings in your skyrimprefs.ini :\r\nNote for Ambient Occlusion and perhaps other things to look right you need to set\r\nbFloatPointRenderTarget=1\r\nbFXAAEnabled=1 (If you want to get rid of jaggies)\r\nsD3DDevice=\\\"ENB\\\" (which should exist and already be set after using the Skyrim launcher once)\r\n\r\nNote: if you\\'re a magic user or just get annoyed at the lens flare you can go into enbseries.ini and change these settings below:\r\n\r\n[CAMERAFX]\r\nLenzReflectionIntensityDay= (change this to 0.0)\r\nLenzReflectionIntensityNight= (change this to 0.0)\r\nLenzReflectionPowerDay= (change this to 1.0)\r\nLenzReflectionPowerNight= (keep this at 1.0)\r\n\r\nI appreciate any comments or concerns you have with this profile and post them in the comments section. I love constructive criticism and if you have any requests I\\'ll try to accommodate them. I don\\'t however put up with bashing on people\\'s mods if you don\\'t like it then don\\'t download it don\\'t bash or hate on it and if you like it let me know and endorse!\r\n\r\n||Recommended Mods|\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3068] Immersive Waters[/url] by Gnozer\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=141] Skyrim Flora Overhaul[/url] by Vurt (I use everything but the trees)\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2146] Serious HD Retexture Landscape Skyrim[/url] by Z4G4\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2616] Sun and clouds textures[/url] by canguilhem\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRemmy88\r\n\r\n||Credits||\r\nBoris Vorontsov - Original Ultimate graphic enhancement\r\nHis Site: [url=http://enbdev.com] http://enbdev.com[/url]\r\n\r\nHeliosDoubleSix for his ENB Profile\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4142] ENB HD6 Lighting Enhancement Mod[/url]\r\n ",
