  "descriptionHtml": "This Mod is for \\\"MMOxReview\\\", because he loves this little girl so much. Hopefully he will see this mod. That would be really nice. :D\r\n\r\nThanks for showing my mod in Skyrim mods weekly and thanks to grant69 for suggesting this mod!\r\n[youtube]ySIDUI1Ckjw[/youtube]\r\n\r\nWhat the Mod does:\r\n\r\nIt adds a Spell wich allows you to summon an explosive \\\"Braith\\\" (nice little girl in Whiterun) wich explodes when someone attacks her.\r\nShe can also be used for \\\"fasttraveling\\\" but u should activate godmode before trying.\r\n\r\nWhere to find the Spelltome:\r\n\r\nWhen you enter \\\"Dragonsreach\\\" look to the left. You will see a chest wich is called \\\"Chest of Braiths\\\". Open it and take the book.\r\n\r\nGood Idea to test this one:\r\n\r\nKill Braiths with an explosive Braith! o.O\r\n\r\nHope you guys like this mod. If yes please write a comment.\r\nPlease check out my other mods too and\r\nhave a nice day!",
