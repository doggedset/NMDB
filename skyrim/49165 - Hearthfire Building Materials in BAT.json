  "descriptionHtml": "Having tried all the other &#34;Cheat Chest&#34; type mods on Nexus I found myself annoyed at the fact that they were all missing items, added an excess of materials I didn&#39;t need, AND added another piece of clutter (Chest) outside my house that would never be used.\r<br />\r<br />I made this simple file to give you the exact amount of materials you need WITHOUT having to install new chests around your homes.\r<br />\r<br />This BAT file includes the EXACT amount of materials to build:\r<br />--Entryway--\r<br />--Main Hall--\r<br />--Cellar--\r<br />--Outside Buildings--\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Updated&#33;&#34; Now includes all the Wing Additions in BAT form&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Simply put the file in your main Skyrim folder: &#34;C:Program Files (x86)-&gt;Steam-&gt;steamapps-&gt;common-&gt;skyrim&#34; (BAT files go in the same directory as your Launcher/SKSE NOT the &#34;DATA&#34; folder)\r<br />\r<br />Once in game, just open your console and type:\r<br />&#34;bat House&#34; \r<br />(without the quotes) and everything will be deposited in your inventory.\r<br />\r<br />The file DOES NOT include the exact materials for the &#34;Small House&#34;, it was made to build from an empty plot of land to a fully furnished Main Hall with Cellar.\r<br />\r<br />It DOES include:\r<br />All the Sawn Logs\r<br />All the Outside Constructions \r<br />All the materials needed to complete The Shrines\r<br />All the materials needed to complete Trophies\r<br />(You will have a &#34;few&#34; extra materials left over depending on the house, because each house has a unique Outside Building i.e. Apiary, Grinding Wheel, Fish Hatchery)\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Updated&#33;&#34; By request all &#34;Wing Additions&#34; have been added to the main file in separate folders (East, North, West)\r<br />\r<br />&lt;&gt;East Wings&lt;&gt;\r<br />Armory\r<br />Kitchen\r<br />Library\r<br />\r<br />&lt;&gt;North Wings&lt;&gt;\r<br />Alchemy Laboratory\r<br />Storage Room\r<br />Trophy Room\r<br />\r<br />&lt;&gt;West Wings&lt;&gt;\r<br />Bedrooms\r<br />Enchanter&#39;s Tower\r<br />Greenhouse\r<br />\r<br />Trophy Room: I have included all the materials to Build and Furnish this Wing, but have not included the materials to furnish all the &#34;Pedestal Statues&#34;. There are more Statues than Pedestals available and I would either have to add a lot of &#34;unnecessary&#34; items or choose statues for you and add those items. (I&#39;m not your interior designer, you can gather and place your own Statues to suit your tastes&#33;)\r<br />",
