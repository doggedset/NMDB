Defeat the terror lurking below in the catacombs, and Castle Stonespire can be yours&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://s804.photobucket.com/user/Adamant19/media/DescriptionSmaller_zpsf5ac229d.jpg.html][img]http://i804.photobucket.com/albums/yy327/Adamant19/DescriptionSmaller_zpsf5ac229d.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />Tired of seeing castles made from the Mage&#39;s College exterior? Tired of castles built from a hodgepodge of architecture?&#33; Well look no further, for this is indeed the castle abode you&#39;ve been waiting for&#33; Built entirely from Solitude statics this castle looks every inch the majestic stronghold. With 1.5 npc&#39;s have been included along with a pseudo quest. To find the castle, just follow the river upstream from Dragon Bridge. \r<br />\r<br />[youtube]Qee3X7QeBGs[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s an excellent video featuring the castle. Note however this represents version 1.0 and not the current version. \r<br />\r<br />[url=http://s804.photobucket.com/user/Adamant19/media/FeaturesSmaller_zpsafdc46c0.jpg.html][img]http://i804.photobucket.com/albums/yy327/Adamant19/FeaturesSmaller_zpsafdc46c0.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />1. All crafting stations including cooking pot.\r<br />2. A moderate amount of weapon plaques, racks, and display cases. \r<br />3. Fully navmeshed. \r<br />4. Purchasable NPC&#39;s merchants and followers.\r<br />5. Pseudo Quest\r<br />6. Functioning Portcullis.\r<br />7. Moderate Storage.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://s804.photobucket.com/user/Adamant19/media/InstallationSmaller_zpsaa63c9ef.jpg.html][img]http://i804.photobucket.com/albums/yy327/Adamant19/InstallationSmaller_zpsaa63c9ef.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />First uninstall any older version of Castle Stonespire you might have, and grab your loot if you have any stored in said version. Once you&#39;ve finished, then you can simply drop the new Castle Stonespire1_5.esp and .bsa files into your data directory.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://s804.photobucket.com/user/Adamant19/media/FAQSmaller_zps95478048.jpg.html][img]http://i804.photobucket.com/albums/yy327/Adamant19/FAQSmaller_zps95478048.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />\r<br />Q: You mentioned a pseudo quest, how does it work?\r<br />\r<br />A: Using the same design principals as my Grayhill Keep abode, I&#39;ve included a small number of notes and journals which trigger certain events. Simply read them as you find them and it should prove easy enough.\r<br />\r<br />Q: What if I want to live in the derelict version of the castle?\r<br />\r<br />A: You can certainly do so, but it wasn&#39;t designed to be used in such a way.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Are the exterior castle windows supposed to be black in the derelict version?\r<br />\r<br />A: Yes. Annoyingly I couldn&#39;t find a emmitance data that made the windows dim all throughout the day. So I made do with black planes. \r<br />\r<br />Q: We finally have NPC&#39;s&#33; Yay&#33; What&#39;s gonna be in the next update?\r<br />\r<br />A: Unless someone reports a catastrophic error/bug, there won&#39;t be another update. \r<br />\r<br />Q: Why won&#39;t there be another update?\r<br />\r<br />A: I feel I&#39;ve worked on this mod enough already, and really just don&#39;t enjoy working on it anymore. I&#39;m very glad you&#39;ve all enjoyed this mod, but for me it never achieved the heights of Centurion&#39;s and  mr_siika&#39;s work back in Elder Scrolls Oblivion, which is what I was aiming for as I designed this mod. \r<br />\r<br />Q: What ENB do you use?\r<br />\r<br />A: Since my gaming pc isn&#39;t anything to boast about, I use RealLike ENB by s3b3k87. It allows for some of the cool effects of general ENB&#39;s, but with practically no effect on FPS. ",
