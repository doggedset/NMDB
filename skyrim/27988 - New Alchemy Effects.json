  "descriptionHtml": "New Alchemy Effects\r<br />\r<br />-adds about 60 effects,90 potions,100 ingredients.\r<br />-reduces the cost of craft potions. (This slows skill levelling.)\r<br />-removes useless effects such as Ravage/Damage Stamina, and re-balanced.\r<br />-spider, chaurus, falmer poison are enhanced for Resist Poison, Cure Poison.\r<br />-merchants sell more ingredients, potions, recipes.\r<br />-using recipes allow you to craft vanilla potions at alchemy labs.\r<br />-perks are tweaked.\r<br />-and a lot more.\r<br />\r<br />I believe these numbers and pictures are enough for people who doesn&#39;t want to read.\r<br />If you&#39;d like to know more, read the details below.\r<br />\r<br />I tweaked skill levelling, and cost of craft potions on version 1.2, so it should be better than before. Leveled lists are also edited, so you might need Relav,Delav tags and 31 days waiting if it&#39;s not a new game.\r<br />\r<br />======= Details =======\r<br />(0) - Alchemy Labs.\r<br />(1) - New effects.\r<br />(2) - New ingredients.\r<br />(3) - Potions.\r<br />(4) - Perks.\r<br />(5) - Merchants.\r<br />(6) - No damage weapons.\r<br />(7) - Explosive arrows.\r<br />(8) - Compatibility and Known Issues.\r<br />(9) - Change log.\r<br />===================\r<br />\r<br />(0) === ALCHEMY LABS ===\r<br />Alchemy labs will be added at most of alchemy shops. What you can do with them are Potion crafting, Converting items and more. Using this labs might be the best way to gain experiences.\r<br />\r<br />(1) ===NEW EFFECTS===\r<br />New Effects.\r<br />-Absorb Health, Magicka, Stamina\r<br />-Fire, Frost, Shock Damage \r<br />-Berserk (Weapons,magics do double damage)\r<br />-Light, Mage Light (Potion and Poison)\r<br />-Ethereal\r<br />-Night Eye\r<br />-Shield (Increases armor rate)\r<br />-Damage Armor Rate\r<br />-Absorb Spell\r<br />-Soul trap\r<br />-Summon Flame, Frost, Storm Atronachs\r<br />-Summon Famillier\r<br />-Water walking\r<br />-Beast Form\r<br />-Disarm\r<br />-Reflect Damage\r<br />-Dragonrend\r<br />-Muffle\r<br />-Silence (Instantly unable to cast a spell. See the pictures.)\r<br />-Command Daedra, Creatures, Humanoid\r<br />-Fortify Unarmed damage\r<br />-Fortify Shout\r<br />-Stagger\r<br />-Unrelenting Force\r<br />-Lingering Restore Health, Magicka, Stamina\r<br />-Fire,Frost,Shock Explosion\r<br />-Cure Poison\r<br />-Fire,Frost,Shock Cloak\r<br />-Fortify Destruction, Conjuration, Alteration, Illusion, Restoration.(Reduce the cost of magicka)\r<br />-Fortify Speed\r<br />-Summon Dremora\r<br />-Blind (Target won&#39;t see you, just like the falmer.)\r<br />-Resist Arrow\r<br />-Damage Health, Fire, Frost, Shock Area (Area effects. Use this with melee weapons.I might remove this.)\r<br />\r<br />Removed effects.\r<br />-Damage Magicka\r<br />-Damage Magicka Regen\r<br />-Damage Stamina\r<br />-Damage Stamina Regen\r<br />-Ravage Magicka,Stamina\r<br />-Fortify Block,Enchanting,Heavy Armor,Light Armor,Lockpicking,Marksman,One Handed,Pick Pocket,Smithing,Sneak,Two Handed.\r<br />\r<br />These effects are added and removed from the ingredients. Some are still buyable and craftable.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m still not sure what kind of poison is the best for skyrim, so there are 3 types in this mod. Craft poison is vanilla&#39;s lingering damage. Poisons from merchants are instant poisons, and weaker but longer duration poisons.\r<br />Fire causes a bit stronger damage than others, but Frost and Shock cause 3 times stamina and magicka damage.\r<br />\r<br />(2) === NEW INGREDIENTS ===\r<br />Foods, Minerals, Gems, Pelts and more items are able to use as Alchemical Ingredients. I can&#39;t write them all, but many items you can think of using as alchemical ingredients will be useable.\r<br />Merchants sell them, animals drop their items, and food-ingredients can be found from Barrels or sacks.\r<br />\r<br />---CONVERT ITEMS---\r<br />You can convert Food,Misc items to Alchemical ingredients at the alchemy labs I mentioned above.\r<br />e.g\r<br />-Tomato (Food) to Tomato (Ingredient).\r<br />-Ebony Ingot (Misc) to Two Ebony Ore (Ingredient).\r<br />-Common Soulgem (Misc) to Three Soulgem Fragments(Ingredient).\r<br />-and a lot more.\r<br />\r<br />Atronach forge recipes are added, so you can even craft fire salts or such items.\r<br />Jewelries are also useable, and gives you gem-ingredients.\r<br />\r<br />(3) === POTIONS===\r<br />All potions are balanced to this mod, and renamed to &#34;Poison of Damage Health I,II,III,IV,V&#34; or something like this.\r<br />Potion&#39;s weights are 0.1 to 0.5, Craft Potions and drinks such as Ale,Mead are 0.25. \r<br />e.g\r<br />Vanilla\r<br />-Weak Fear Poison (Magnitude=5,Duration=30,Weight=0.5,Value=98)\r<br />This mod\r<br />-Poison of Fear I (Magnitude=20,Duration=20,Weight=0.1,Value=48)\r<br />\r<br />--- CRAFTABLE POTIONS ---\r<br />Vanilla potions and some useful potions are craftable at the alchemy labs. All of them require recipes, and you can buy them from merchants.\r<br />(You always need a recipe to craft a potion, so be careful. If you removed a recipe from the inventory, it will NOT show up even if you have the right ingredients.)\r<br />\r<br />If you want the vanilla effects like fortify enchanting or such, use this content.\r<br />\r<br />--- UPGRADE POTIONS ---\r<br />You can combine the SAME potions, and get stronger potions. Crafted potions can NOT be combined.\r<br />e.g\r<br />-Poison of Damage Helth I + Poison of Damage Health I = Poison of Damage Health II. (Others are also like II+II=III, III+III=IV, IV+IV=V.)\r<br />\r<br />--- THIEVES GUILD POTIONS ---\r<br />You can easily get TG potions more than vanilla in this mod.\r<br />Requires a recipe to craft a potion just like others, but merchants like Tonilia,Enthir sell it. They only sell first I,II,III potions and recipes. If you want to have better one, be the guild master and try Herluin Lothaire at The ragged Flagon. He has all TG potions and recipes.\r<br />\r<br />(4) === PERKS ===\r<br />First, I don&#39;t hate vanilla perks, so this mod is focused on tweaking.\r<br />Experimentor, Concentrated Poison, Green thumbs are the most important perks from alchemy, but Experimentor&#39;s requirements were just too high.\r<br />50 skills was enough to open most of effects even with this mod, so their requirements are simply lowered. Other two perks are very useful so tweaking and adding more perks are enough.\r<br />\r<br />Alchemist (0)\r<br />-Potions you mix are 20% more effective.\r<br />-Eating an ingredient reveals first two effects.\r<br />\r<br />Poisoner (30)\r<br />-Poisons you mix are 25% more effective.\r<br />-Silently harm enemies by placing poisons in their pockets.\r<br />\r<br />Experimenter (35/50)\r<br />-Eating an ingredient reveals first three(all) effects.\r<br />\r<br />Concentrated PoisonÂ  (50/75/100)\r<br />-Poisons applied to weapons last for twice(three,four times) as many hits.\r<br />\r<br />Green Thumb (60/90)\r<br />-Two(Four) ingredients are gathered from plants.\r<br />\r<br />*Numbers are required skils.\r<br />\r<br />(5) === MERCHANTS ===\r<br />They simply have more ingredients, and also sell new ingredients and potions. (small bugs are fixed, so they should sell items like Bear Claws, Pearl correctly.)\r<br />I let them sell their images of items more, so It would make some differences more than vanilla.\r<br />\r<br />e.g\r<br />-Babbete(The dark brotherhood) sells like human flesh, vampire dust, poisonous ingredients more.\r<br />-Orgnar (River wood) sells only food-ingredients.\r<br />-Enthir (Winterhold) sells Fire,Frost,Void salts or such.\r<br />-Khajiit sells Skooma, Sleeping Tree Sap, Gems as they seem like fan of those.\r<br />-Orcs (Strongholds) sells Minerals, Animal pelts,meats or such.\r<br />-Others sell their regional ingredients more, like Fishes in Riften, Mushrooms in Falkreath or something like this.\r<br />\r<br />(6) === NO DAMAGE WEAPONS ===\r<br />No damage Bows, Arrows are craftable at the Anvil in Whiterun. (Take the right path, and there will be an anvil between the main gate and the smelter.)\r<br />These weapons cause no damage to npcs, so attacking is not a crime.\r<br />\r<br />This is definitely overpowered, but I needed a better poison delivery system since sneaking attack with bows tend to kill the target. (use this with frenzy or blind effects.)\r<br />\r<br />(7) === EXPLOSIVE ARROWS ===\r<br />You can craft explosive arrows at the Anvil.\r<br />Ingredients are Arrow + Ingredient + Skooma.\r<br />e.g\r<br />-Daedric Arrow of Frenzy explosion = Daedric Arrow+Troll Fat+skooma\r<br />-Ebony Arrow of Fire explosion = Ebony arrow+Fire salt+Skooma\r<br />\r<br />- Frenzy=Troll fat\r<br />- Calm=Moon sugar\r<br />- Fear=Powdered Mammmoth tusk\r<br />- Soultrap=Salt\r<br />- Silence=Blue Butterfly wing\r<br />- Fire=Fire Salt\r<br />- Frost=Frost Salt\r<br />- Shock=Void Salt\r<br />- Paralyze=Imp stool\r<br />- Turn Undead=Garlic\r<br />\r<br />You can also craft small Fire,Frost,Shock explosive arrows with Filled Soul gem.Using better soul gems give you stronger arrows.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;I might remove this content oneday.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />(8) === Compatibility and Known issues===\r<br />I got some questions about other perk mods. However, I don&#39;t use them, so I can&#39;t give you the best answers. (People who read this probably know what to do by yourself, so I am not worrying though.)\r<br />\r<br />Using ingredients from other mods might give you strangely strong/weak potions.\r<br />\r<br />DLCs are not supported yet. (First build of this mod was before dlcs, so if oneday I could finish this, I would support it. I hope someone will create a better mod by then.)\r<br />\r<br />(9) === Change log===\r<br />There are many things I have done, so I have no idea what I exactly changed.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.2\r<br />-some recipe bugs are fixed.\r<br />-tweaked skill levelling,effect strength.\r<br />-many recipes for potions and ingredients are added.\r<br />-food-ingredients can be found from barrels.\r<br />-banish,Slow time effects are removed, Fortify sneak attack is in craftable potion.\r<br />-one of Deer hide,Alto wine are removed.\r<br />-enemies drop ingredients.\r<br />-magelight poison effect is added.\r<br />-perks are edited.\r<br />-merchants sell different items.\r<br />-fire,frost,shock poison has different stats.\r<br />-mages have more chance of dropping recipes, and the recipes are written useful potions.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.1\r<br />-many bugs are fixed.(most of them are crafting recipes.)\r<br />-hammers are craftable at the Anvil.\r<br />-many potions are renamed.\r<br />-new perks are added.\r<br />-effects stats are changed,and re-balanced,re-weighted.\r<br />-merchants sell more ingredients.\r<br />-jarinroot,Crimson Nirnroot are craftable.\r<br />-command Undead,Damage automaton,Dead Thrall,Shield Charge,Deflect arrow potions are added.\r<br />-fortify Speed,summon flaming thrall,summon dremora,blind,resist arrow,contagious damage health/fire/frost/shock effects are added.\r<br />-many ingredients graphics,names,weights are changed.\r<br />-no damage weapons are re-named.\r<br />-fortify alchemy magnitudes are lowered.\r<br />-explosion arrows are craftable with filled soul gems.\r<br />-many items are useable as Ingredients.(pelts,hide,cooked food and more)\r<br />-ingot gives you 2 ores.\r<br />-cooking food increases alchemy skill.\r<br />-vanilla potions are re-named,re-balanced.\r<br />-nighteye color changed\r<br />-atronach forge recipes are added.(Fire,Frost,void salts,Daedra heart are craftable at the lab)\r<br />-jewelies give you an ingredient.\r<br />-many recipes are added.\r<br />-and many more....\r<br />\r<br />On 1.3.\r<br />-Tweak more especially cost of potions.\r<br />-DLCs might be supported.\r<br />-Foods might be edited.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks for reading till the end.",
