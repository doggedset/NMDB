  "descriptionHtml": "As much as I love Immersive Armors, the mod always felt somewhat incomplete to me because many of the cooler armors fit so badly on females, I find them almost unusable. So I fixed it.\r<br />\r<br />Einherjar Armors now have proper female models.\r<br />\r<br />Armors that were previously a few sizes too big now fit properly. (Check Screenshots for a few side by side comparisons)\r<br />\r<br />With the exception of the Trollsbane armor, which I never use and which I feel should be super bulky anyway (since you&#39;re basically masquerading as a troll lol), every single armor in the Immersive Armors pack has been refitted to the CBBE and UUNP bodyshapes, complete with Bodyslide support for easy customization.\r<br />\r<br />Added HDT support where it makes sense. (That means no jiggling metal plates, thank you very much).\r<br />\r<br />The Hunter Armor, the Paladin Armor and the Nord Mail Light Armor have been further altered to better suit my tastes (again, check Screenshots for side by side comparisons). If you disagree with the changes, then delete the folders &#34;meshes&#92;armor&#92;hunterarmor&#34;, &#34;meshes&#92;armor&#92;paladin&#34; and &#34;textures&#92;armor&#92;viking textures&#34; to revert them to their default state.\r<br />\r<br />Note that the prepacked default meshes are fitted to the either the CBBE Curvy body shape or the standard UNP bodyshape depending on your choice of CBBE or UUNP, with no HDT physics. If you want a different body shape or HDT support, you&#39;ll need to run the armors through Bodyslide.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33;",
