  "summary": "Makes the fork and knife able to be sharpened at a grindstone and makes it use the One-Handed skill.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Basics[/b]\r<br />\r<br />The fork in vanilla Skyrim can be enchanted, but is not improvable at a grindstone. It will also always do 1 damage regardless of your One-Handed skill.\r<br />\r<br />The knife (basic dinner knife) has the same problem, except it does 3 damage.\r<br />\r<br />This mod changes that, so it can be improved and used like any other one-handed weapon.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Features[/b]\r<br />\r<br />- Improve a fork at a grindstone (Requires 1 iron ingot)\r<br />- Improve a knife at a grindstone (Requires 1 iron ingot)\r<br />- Makes fork and knife damage scale with One-Handed level\r<br />\r<br />[b]Why did you make this?[/b]\r<br />\r<br />A challenge run I want to do is with the weakest weapon in the game. That would be the fork. But it would be impossible to complete without smithing improvements or skills having an effect on damage. So I changed that to make it just barely possible to play the challenge.\r<br />\r<br />For version 2 I added the knife, because why not? It goes well with the fork for anyone who wants to RP a hardcore cannibal or a Dinnermancer or something.\r<br />\r<br />Plus it only took about 10 minutes to make and test.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Compatibility[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Should be compatible with any mods so long as they don&#39;t change the fork and knife.",
