  "descriptionHtml": "A new texture for the meanest dragon in Skyrim, Alduin. The colour scheme was inspired by classical fantasy dragons. I made this because although whoever textured Alduin did a fantastic job with the detail, I think the black and grey colour scheme was fairly boring and I wanted to spruce it up a bit.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy it!\r\n\r\nThis is the eeevil version, a more cheesy fantasy retexture can be found here:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1532\r\n\r\nOr the Red and Gold Version found here:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2169\r\n\r\nThis mod should install with Nexus Mod Manager but for those (like me) who haven\\'t got it yet, manual installation instructions are below:\r\n\r\nTo manually Install:\r\nSimply unzip the zip archive then move the \\\"data\\\" folder to your \\\"Steam>SteamApps>common>skyrim\\\" folder. When asked if you want to merge/overwrite click yes.\r\n\r\nTo manually Uninstall:\r\nDelete the following files from your \\\"Steam>SteamApps>common>skyrim>data>textures>actors>alduin\\\" folder:\r\n\\\"alduin\\\"\r\n\\\"alduin_lod\\\"\r\n\\\"alduineyes\\\"\r\n\\\"alduineyes_g\\\"\r\n\r\nCopywright stuff: This file and its description are my intellectual property and can\\'t be redistributed. If you\\'d like to use the texture in your mod however just drop me a pm or comment, I\\'m 99% likely to give you persmission to use it unless your mod is seriously messed up or something.\r\nI\\'m not being anal with the above stuff, it\\'s just to try and stop other websites from uploading my material.
