This mod will allow you to choose weather you want to be a werewolf in the [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Silver_Hand]The Silver Hand[/url] quest when your in the Underforgefor the first time. If you choose to not become a werewolf you must do a task for the Circle to be accepted into the Circle of the Companions. Once this task is done you can meet up with Aela the Huntress near Gallows Rock and you will continue on with the [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Silver_Hand]The Silver Hand[/url] quest.
