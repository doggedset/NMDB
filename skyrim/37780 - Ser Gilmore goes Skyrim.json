  "descriptionHtml": "Anyone had seen Rory lately? I mean Ser Roland Gilmore, the mighty knight from the Cousland origin of DAO. Ever since my gay Warden\\'s soul got shouted from his body and transferred to the Skyrim, Rory\\'s been torn and broken. So bad that Anders had to track down the Warden with the help of Justice (Thank you Aisaka for the \\\"Anders from Dragon Age companion and saved game by Aisaka\\\" mod! http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31346). Finally, Ser Gilmore reunites with the Warden! The face might have changed, the race may be different, but LOVE breaks boundaries and conquers all odds :) Let\\'s continue their journey in Skyrim before Anders and Morrigan figure out how to transfer the love birds for DA3! \r\n**location** Frostfruit Inn in Rorikstead :)\r\n\r\nThank you Immortality for the epic mod, the best romance in DAO (Alistair: HEY!) :D\r\nSer Gilmore companion NPC - Fully Voiced by Immortality\r\nhttp://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/851\r\nAlso thank you for Emerj\\'s face mod to make the Rory even hotter!\r\nHandsome Ser Gilmore Morph by Emerj\r\nhttp://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/3314\r\nU guys are inspirations of this Rory goes Skyrim mod XD!
