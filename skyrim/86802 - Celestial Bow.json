It is in a chest at the right of the draugr platform. See the file images for a visual guide of it&#39;s location.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][b]Enchanted Arrows[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Having played much as a stealthy archer, I much prefer the bow over the crossbow. But then having played with the crossbows, I discovered that I really wanted to have a bow that could fire arrows, the way a crossbow fires bolts. \r<br />\r<br />I thought it very unfair that you could obtain crossbows that have the same range as bows, but which fired bolts at supersonic speeds, and had 50% armor penetration, and exploded with extra fire, ice or shock damage&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I decided to create a bow that will fire like a modern, re-curved, high-tension, compound bow, with lighter metallic arrows that flew like crossbow bolts. I also took into consideration that to keep it fair (considering the advantages of the new Dawnguard crossbows) the bow should also be able to fire exploding arrows, similar to the exploding crossbow bolts. It is balanced compared to the crossbow, with the same firing effect, but having 50% increased firing speed, in order to balance out the crossbow&#39;s 50% armor penetration.\r<br />\r<br />One thing that made life difficult as an archer, was to Soul Trap targets. To do this effectively without an enchanted bow, you would have to damage the target to a point, switch from two handed bow weapon to a magic spell, equip that, cast the soul trap spell, switch back to the two handed bow, kill the target, and then only the spell would work.\r<br />\r<br />With the increased firing rate of the Celestial bow, and to keep things balanced, I decided that the bow shouldn&#39;t be enchantable. So to resolve the issue of the soul trap, I finally decided to create a Soul Trap Arrow, which does all of the above, in one action.\r<br />\r<br />For fun, I also added two other enchantable arrows - namely Paralyze (Area of Effect) and Chaos Absorb (provides the same effect as the [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Dwarven_Black_Bow_of_Fate]Dwarven Black Bow of Fate[/url]).\r<br />\r<br />Be warned about the Paralysis arrows: it is an area of effect enchantment that will paralyze not only the target, but you as well, if you are less than 10 meters from the target when you use it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][b]Origin & Mod Objective[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />The Celestial Bow is a re-texture of Auriel&#39;s bow. I love the look of this weapon and added it as a stand-alone mod. You do not need Dawnguard to use it.\r<br />\r<br />It is basically an enhanced version of Zephyr, but with flatter trajectory arrow flight. The Celestial bow and arrows does the same base damage as the Ebony bow and arrows.\r<br />\r<br />The Celestial Arrow model is a new re-texture the Steel Arrow. The quiver has a new modern look to it, and blends well with the bow&#39;s appearance. The arrow shafts are now metallic, instead of wooden (which partially explains their increased impact, range and velocity). \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][b]Versions[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][b]1)  [u]Normal Version[/u][/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />This version of the bow is [u]not enchantable[/u].
