You can also use any of the five Temptresses as a follower by finding them in temples around Skyrim:\r\n\r\n[b][color=#b09176]Vixen[/color][/b]: Class: Range / Located: Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun\r\n[b][color=#b09176]Eliza[/color][/b]: Class: Range / Located: Temple of the Divines in Solitude\r\n[b][color=#b09176]Sasha[/color][/b]: Class:  Melee 2H / Located: Temple of Talos in Windhelm\r\n[b][color=#b09176]Jasmin[/color][/b]: Class:  Melee 2H / Located: Temple of Dibella in Markarth\r\n[b][color=#b09176]Chloe[/color][/b]: Class: Range / Located: Temple of Mara in Riften\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8026/7355191696_99b571af77_b.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[size=4][b][color=#b09176]Temptress Armor / Vixen Outfit[/color][/b][/size]\r\nIn addition, Brokefoot has created the Temptress Armor and Vixen Outfit with several different variants for your personal customization.  The Temptress Armor and Vixen Armor are available for crafting at the forge under the Ebony category, (Smithing Perks are not required).  The materials used for crafting include leather, leather strips, linen cloth and ebony ingots.\r\n\r\n[b][color=#c0b08f]Temptress Armor[/color][/b]\r\nAmulet, Arm Bands, Arm Straps, Belt, Boots, Boots Alt, Bracers, Cloak, Gloves, Gloves Alt, Leg Straps, Shirt, Shirt Alt, Shorts\r\n\r\n[b][color=#c0b08f]Vixen Outfit[/color][/b]\r\nCollar, Leggings, Panties, Sleeves\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7078/7169979637_e23a5998d3_b.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[b][color=#c0b08f]Color variations[/color][/b]\r\nColor variations are also available at the tanning rack.  The materials used to colorize the armor include charcoal, red mountain flowers and chaurus eggs.\r\n\r\nThe following items can be colorized black, red or teal:  \r\n\r\n[i]Temptress Armor[/i]\r\nBelt, Boots Alt, Gloves Alt.\r\n\r\n[i]Vixen Clothing[/i]\r\nCollar, Leggings, Sleeves\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7211/7169979559_f34fe29f53_b.jpg[/img]\r\n[size=4][b][color=#b09176]Mandatory[/color][/b][/size]\r\nFirst you MUST download and install the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168/?tab=2&navtag=/ajax/modimages/?user=0|:|id=10168]ApachiiSkyHair[/url] Mod.  Once the ApachiiSkyHair mod is installed, you can install the TemptressRace mod.  \r\n\r\n[color=#ccc8c0][i]If the ApachiiSkyHair mod isn’t installed the presets will try to load the ApachiiSkyHair but it won’t display correctly.  You can still use the mod and manually select a vanilla hair style (or *insert hair mod here*) if you prefer.  HOWEVER, the followers’ hair will still be bugged.[/i][/color]  \r\n\r\n[size=2][b]NMM Installation - Recommended[/b][/size]\r\nFor NMM simply click \\\"Download with Manager\\\" button and activate the mod to initialize the installer.\r\n\r\n[size=2][b]Manual Installation[/b][/size]\r\nTo install open the RAR file that contains the Data folder.  Note:  Within the Data folder is the TemptressVixen.esp and the textures/meshes folders.  Next use windows explorer to navigate to the root Skyrim directory.  If you are using Vista/Windows 7 you will most likely find the Skyrim folder at:\r\n\r\nC:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/SteamApps/common/Skyrim\r\n\r\nDrag the Data folder from the RAR file into your Skyrim root directory.  This will perform the extraction of the files into the Data folder.  A popup will appear “This destination already contains a folder named ‘Data’..”  Click Yes.  Click Yes if any other popups occur.\r\n\r\n[b][color=#b09176]CBBEv3 Tempress Neck Seam Fix[/color][/b]\r\nPlease note:  The Temptress/Vixen Armor is for the UNP body.  There could be some clipping that will NOT be fixed.  Also, continue to use the femalehead_sk.dds that comes with the main file and not the updated Afternoon Neck Seam Fix.\r\n\r\n[i]Instructions: ==Manual Install Only==[/i]\r\n-Place the [color=#b09176]CBBEv3[/color] textures in the path below:\r\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\temptress\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\female\r\n-Place the [b][color=#b09176]CBBEv3 Tempress Neck Seam Fix[/color][/b] in the same location above.  Overwrite when asked.\r\n-Place the [color=#b09176]CBBEv3[/color] meshes in the path below:\r\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\meshes\\\\temptress\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8287/7730878796_33fddd4ddb_b.jpg[/img]\r\n[b][color=#b09176][i](With or without Dawngaurd)[/i][/color][/b]\r\nThe 1.3c/1.3d update adds the [i]TemptressRaceVampire[/i].  You will need to manually change into this race in order to become a vampire.  \r\n[b]Follow the steps below:[/b]\r\n-Download and install The Temptress Race Update 1.3d\r\n-Download and install the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9717]Better Vampires[/url] mod.\r\n-[i]Optional[/i], download and install the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16506]Vampire Face Less Sunken Cheeks[/url] if you want your Temptress Race to look exactly like the normal version without any sunken cheeks or extended chin. \r\n-Bring up your console with the tilde (\\').\r\n-Please note before you do the next step, if you want vampire eyes you will need to go to the \\'showracemenu\\' and change them first then do the following.  There are two vampire eyes available.  However only the glow version is available to Dawnguard users.  If you don\\'t have Dawnguard the glowing eye will appear empty for a different look.  Type [i][color=#b09176]player.setrace TemptressRaceVampire[/color][/i]\r\n\r\nYou are now a vampire and can customize your abilities and powers with the Better Vampires mod.  A menu option is added under your powers.  Select it like you would a normal power and exit the main menu.  Press \\\"Z\\\" to actually use it and bring the Custom Vampire menu.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4][b][color=#b09176]Removal[/color][/b][/size]\r\n- Remove [color=#b09176]TemptressVixen.esp[/color]\r\n- Remove [color=#b09176]Data\\\\textures\\\\temptress[/color]\r\n- Remove [color=#b09176]Data\\\\meshes\\\\temptress[/color]\r\n- Remove [color=#b09176]Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\FaceGenData\\\\FaceTint\\\\TemptressVixen.esp[/color]\r\n- Remove [color=#b09176]Data\\\\meshes\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\FaceGenData\\\\FaceGeom\\\\TemptressVixen.esp[/color]\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7095/7169985235_41fac23f7d_o.jpg[/img]\r\n[size=4][b][color=#b09176]Recommended[/color][/b][/size]\r\nYou can start a new game and select the Tempress Race when you are given the option to customize your character after exiting the carriage.  This method is highly recommended due to an unlimited amount of different scenarios using your existing character and the ‘showracemenu’ option.  \r\n\r\n[b]OR[/b]\r\n\r\n[size=4][b][color=#b09176]At your own risk:[/color][/b][/size]\r\nOpen your console (`) and type showracemenu -enter-.  It will bring up the character customization menu and you can select the race from there.  \r\n\r\nWhile this option may be used for those currently playing as a female (from any race), please note that this method will reset most (if not all) of your stats if you switch from a male character to female. This issue has been apparent since the release of Skyrim, and is not unique to this mod. We suggest creating a backup of a save before using this method.  You can simply manually save (not an auto save that could be overwritten) and make sure not to save over it.  You can also go to your User\\\\Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Saves and copy any saves into a backup directory for good measure.\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7089/7355191530_447fd94828_b.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[size=4][b][color=#b09176]Compatibility:[/color][/b][/size]\r\nThis is a standalone mod (excluding ApachiiSkyHair) that uses its own files in specific folders intentionally to ensure it doesn’t override other mods on your computer and to guarantee you the exact Vixen Psychos1s created.  For example, the Temptress Race uses the UNP body model and will not conflict with your CBBE installation.  However to ensure armor mods look the way they should on the Tempress Race we recommend the UNP Female Body mod versions of the armors you install.  \r\n\r\n-The Temptresses use the vanilla skeletons for all behaviors. Players have reported issues using modded skeletons.\r\n\r\n[size=4][b][color=#b09176]Recommended Mods:[/color][/b][/size]\r\n-[i]Compatible UNP armor mods[/i]\r\n-[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168/?tab=2&navtag=/ajax/modimages/?user=0|:|id=10168]ApachiiSkyHair[/url] - [color=#b09176]by Apachii[/color]\r\n-[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709]DIMONIZED UNP Female Body[/url]- [color=#b09176]by dimon99[/color] \r\n-[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15105]Sharpshooters Extreme Graphic Vision ENB[/url] - by [color=#b09176]Sharpshooter8[/color]  (realistic lighting mod)\r\n-[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4142]Cinematic Lighting ENB - CLENB[/url] - by [color=#b09176]HD6[/color]  (artistic lighting mod)\r\n-[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15143]Castanistic or Highelf style idle for females[/url][i] (Idle v06)[/i] - by [color=#b09176]Sharkh[/color] \r\n-[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10930]3rd Person Magic Casting Animation Replacer[/url] - by [color=#b09176]mirap[/color] \r\n-[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24828]BLEAK ENB - UNBLEAK ENB[/url] - by [color=#b09176]akiro & trustinall[/color]  \r\n-[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037]UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul[/url] - by [color=#b09176]fLokii[/color]\r\n-[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9717]Better Vampires[/url] - by [color=#b09176]Brehanin2[/color]\r\n-[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16506]Vampire Face Less Sunken Cheecks[/url] - by [color=#b09176]Devacore[/color]\r\n\r\n[b][color=#ccc8c0]The Best UNP Armor Mods by Brokefoot himself:[/color][/b]\r\n- [color=#b09176][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20415]Brokefoots UNP Mashup Compilation[/url][/color] - [i]Including Dandelion, Khantus, Leah, Scamps and Vicky Armor Sets[/i]\r\n- [color=#b09176][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31813]West Wind Combat Series[/url][/color]\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7122/7410883794_0dc3553176_b.jpg[/img]\r\n[b][color=#dca123]Optional CBBE v3.2 Neck Seam Fix[/color][/b]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/2586883]TTek[/url] kindly shared a CBBE v3.2 Neck Seam Fix for those that use it with the Temptress Race.  This is a manual install optional download.\r\n\r\nManually install in the path below:\r\n[i]C:\\\\..\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\temptress\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\female[/i]\r\n\r\n[b][color=#dca123]v1.3e - RaceCompatibility Addition[/color][/b]\r\nThis was not created by me but by [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/5363]TMPhoenix[/url] who created the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24168]RaceCompatibility[/url] mod.  He allowed me to host the files since I\\'d like to keep anything related to the Temptress Race in one convenient location. [i][b]Please note I have not tested this optional download.[/b][/i]\r\n\r\nIf you use the new Temptress RC patch, you should not use the Temptress vampirism patch as that would cause all sorts of incompatibilities. RaceCompatibility will take care of the vampirism.\r\n\r\nI\\'m not sure how your existing save/game will act if you switch between the RC and previous Vampirism downloads. If you were already using the Vampirism update combined with Better Vampires and had no problems there really isn\\'t a need to download the RC counterpart. This was created and made available for those that do use the RaceCompatibility mod already and needed the Temptress Race to be made compatible with it. Also for those that are just now downloading the Temptress Race mod and starting fresh. \r\n\r\nHere are some notes on the changes by TMPhoenix: \r\n\r\n- Added a vampire race (copied from original, only eyes are different as well as the appropriate keywords, and powers)\r\n- Removed a few dirty edits\r\n- added a quest + script to handle the race compatibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=#dca123]v1.3d[/color][/b]\r\n-Added glowing eyes for Dawnguard users.\r\n-Some misc code revisions\r\n\r\n[b][color=#dca123]v1.3c[/color][/b]\r\n-Added vampire support.  (More details below)\r\n-Reduced the height of the women.  They are now about the same height as other Nord females\r\n-Added vampire eye option\r\n\r\n[b]Vampire Instructions[/b]\r\nThis update adds the [i]TemptressRaceVampire[/i].  You will need to manually change into this race in order to become a vampire.  Follow the steps below:\r\n-Download and install the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9717]Better Vampires[/url] mod.\r\n-Bring up your console with the tilde (\\').\r\n-Please note before you do the next step, if you want vampire eyes you will need to go to the \\'showracemenu\\' and change them first then do the following.  Type [i][color=#b09176]player.setrace TemptressRaceVampire[/color][/i]\r\n\r\nYou are now a vampire and can customize your abilities and powers with the Better Vampires mod.  A menu option is added under your powers.  Select it like you would a normal power and exit the main menu.  Press \\\"Z\\\" to actually use it and bring the Custom Vampire menu.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=#dca123]v1.3b[/color][/b]\r\n-Added a different [i]femalehead_sk.dds[/i] to improve the discoloration of the face outside during the afternoon.\r\n\r\n[b][color=#dca123]v1.3b[/color][/b]\r\n-Added CBB3v3 compatible head (texture, specular & normal map changes) for a better neck seam.  We will not be supporting the CBBE version. The armor is still UNP only (works with CBBE with some misc clipping). However for those wanting to use the CBBE anyway, I decided I would create the Temptress head to also fit that body.  Look at screenshots for comparisons.  INSTRUCTIONS are above in the Installation section.\r\n\r\n[b][color=#dca123]v1.3[/color][/b]\r\n-Mounted Combat is now fully compatible with v1.6 patch.\r\n-The [i]Optimized Texture Pack[/i] and [i]Neck Seam Fix[/i] are now the default textures.\r\n-The 4 Apachii hair styles previously unavailable during character creation are now able to be selected.\r\n\r\n[i]Follower Updates/Changes:[/i]\r\n\r\n-All names changed to omit \\\"the Temptress\\\" from each\r\n-The girls are all eligible for marriage\r\n-They will commit nearly any crime, if asked to do so\r\n-Chloe, Eliza, and Vixen are classified as CombatRanger with a combat style of HumanMissile\r\n-Jasmin and Sasha are classified as CombatWarrior2H with a combat style of HumanBoss2H\r\n-Each of the follower\\'s traits/stats have been upgraded to a necessary \\\"Aggressive\\\" and \\\"Foolhardy\\\" state\r\n-Each of the follower\\'s health/magicka/stamina have a necessary offset boost of 300\r\n-They will now be wearing a simplified Temptress Outfit* when the player first encounters them\r\n-The follower inventory for CombatRanger includes: Ebony Bow, 500 Daedric Arrows, 1750 Gold, 4 Charcoal, 4 Chaurus Eggs, 4 Red Mountain Flowers\r\n-The follower inventory for CombatWarrior2H includes: Ebony Blade, 1750 Gold, 4 Charcoal, 4 Chaurus Eggs, 4 Red Mountain Flowers\r\n\r\n[b][color=#dca123]v1.2b[/color][/b]\r\n-An Optimized Texture Pack is now available for those with performance issues or lower end machines.  The neck seam fix of v1.02 is also included in this release.\r\n\r\n[b][color=#dca123]v1.2[/color][/b]\r\n-Improved the neck seam.  It will still have issues in some lighting scenarios (like afternoon sun, outside), however it is a pretty big improvement.\r\n\r\n[b][color=#dca123]v1.1[/color][/b]\r\n[i]Made this file optional due to Bethesda Creation Kit hotfix.  Most users haven\\'t had issues however some have reported reverting to the previous version improved performance.  I\\'m sure we\\'ll have to revisit this soon.[/i]\r\n\r\n-Fixed an issue where the followers wouldn\\'t fight with weapons.  They may not have the weapon equipped in the beginning but as soon as you enter combat they will function properly and use the weapon you give them, (ranged and melee).\r\n\r\n-Fixed an issue that made it difficult to make the followers equip other armor/clothing.  If you have one as a follower already they will still have the hide armor on but you will be able to remove it from their inventory.  The default outfit is now Bar Keep Clothing (dress).\r\n\r\n[size=4][b][color=#b09176]Known Issues and Comments:[/color][/b][/size]\r\n-The male character is still available in the character customization menu but will be bugged and isn’t meant to be played.\r\n-Some misc armor clipping issues during custom idle animations/poses.\r\n-Gloves clip a bit during first person view when you have magic equipped. \r\n-Shorts have clipping (hole) in the back if the belt isn’t worn.\r\n-Dark Brotherhood \\\"To Kill an Empire\\\" questline is bugged (for all custom races) when talking to Chef Gianna.  Fix is in the FAQ section.\r\n-There is no intention to create a CBBE version of this mod.  The Temptress Race was created to be a true replica of Vixen.  She uses the UNP Female body mod because that is how Psychos1s created her.  \r\n-The Vixen follower (and possibly others) can sometimes show random facial expressions that aren’t great for screenshots, (a sort of half grin).\r\n-The followers are just like the vanilla followers and will match the level you are when you first interact with them.  They do have a minimum level but there are no plans to create “high level” non-scalable versions. AS of 1.6 the followers are [i]supposed[/i] to have their stats increase every time you level.  Before they would be locked based on the level you were when you were in their vicinity as per the [url=http://www.creationkit.com/Stats_Tab]Creation Kit info by Bethesda[/url].\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8005/7463350968_e95227079b_b.jpg[/img]\r\n[size=2][b][color=#b09176]Q:  What face does the Temptress Race use?  Can I use Better Females/Coverwoman/‘insert face texture mod here’? [/color][/b][/size]\r\nA: The Temptress Race uses a custom face texture created by Psychos1s. It uses elements from Better Females and the skin texture from Navetsea’s skin texture mod combined with Psychos1s’ own photoshop work.  It also uses custom normal maps and specular files.  If you replace any of these you can run into neck seam / face discoloration issues.\r\n\r\n[size=2][b][color=#b09176]Q:  Can or are you planning on making a CBBE/ADEC/LB/CHSBHC etc version of the Tempress Race mod or armor?[/color][/b][/size]\r\nA: No.  However you can manually put the CBBE body in the appropriate folder.  Then use the provided CBBE custom head texture (including normal map, specular).  Follow the instructions in the “Installation” section of this page under ‘CBBEv3 Tempress Neck Seam Fix’\r\n\r\n[size=2][b][color=#b09176]Q: Can you make a non-nude version of the mod?[/color][/b][/size]\r\nA.  No.  However you can manually add the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7736/?tab=2&navtag=/ajax/modimages/?user=0|:|id=7736]Layered Bikini mod[/url] replacer.  Its in the optional files entitled \\\"Replace UNP\\\".  Place the files in the paths below:\r\n[color=#ccc8c0][i]C:\\\\...\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\temptress\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\female[/i][/color]\r\n[color=#ccc8c0][i]C:\\\\...\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\meshes\\\\temptress\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets[/i][/color]\r\n\r\n[size=2][b][color=#b09176]Q:  The game crashes on startup.  The game crashes at the logo or right after the logo.[/color][/b][/size]\r\nA: This is  likely a mod conflict. It is strongly recommended that you run a program like BOSS to sort load order. The TemptressVixen.esp will most likely be towards the bottom of the list.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you are doing so - stop running a cracked version of the game.\r\n\r\n[size=2][b][color=#b09176]Q: How do I get the Temptress Armor and Vixen clothing?[/color][/b][/size]\r\nA: You can craft the armor and clothing at any forge under the Ebony category, (Smithing Perks are not required). You can also change the color of some of the armor/clothing at any tanning rack.  For more information read the Temptress Armor / Vixen Outfit on this page.\r\n\r\n[size=2][b][color=#b09176]Q:  What skeleton does the Tempress Race use? [/color][/b][/size] \r\nA:   The Tempress Race uses the default skeleton (same as Nord Race).  Issues may arise if you are using modded skeletons.\r\n\r\n[size=2][b][color=#b09176]Q:  The Temptress followers don’t use the bow I give them.  They are using the Hunting Bow.[/color][/b][/size]\r\nA:  The bow is not a problem with the mod. Instead, it is an issue with the game and followers in general.  There are a couple of ways around it.\r\n\r\n1.  Use the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037]UFO (Ultimate Follower Overhaul)[/url] mod and you will see the Hunting Bow in their inventory after you’ve gone through the appropriate dialogue. After speaking with them, you can just take it out of their inventory like any other item..\r\n\r\n2.  Manually remove the Hunting Bow from the follower’s inventory using the console:\r\n-Pull up the console by pressing tilde (`)\r\n-Click the follower so her ID shows up in the middle\r\n-type: removeitem 10e2dd 1 (you will have to perform this until you see the \\\"GetitemCount displays 0.  Normally they have 2.  \r\n\r\n[size=2][b][color=#b09176]Q:  The faces/heads are darker than the rest of the body.[/color][/b][/size]\r\nA: When this happens, it likely means your game is not loading their ‘facegen tint data’. The reason for not loading could be one of three things:\r\n1. Mod conflict, try running BOSS or similar program.\r\n2. Your PC is struggling to load all the textures, not only from this mod, but others you may have installed (such as HiRes packs). The game engine may pick and choose ‘priority’ as to which textures may or may not get displayed properly. The more VRAM you have, the safer it is to run the Temptress Race mod.\r\n3. The facegendata files weren\\'t installed correctly.  They should be here:\r\n[color=#b09176]Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\FaceGenData\\\\FaceTint\\\\TemptressVixen.esp[/color]\r\n[color=#b09176]Data\\\\meshes\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\FaceGenData\\\\FaceGeom\\\\TemptressVixen.esp[/color]\r\n\r\nThis mod uses compressed high resolution textures that could cause issues with lower end machines.\r\n\r\n[size=2][b][color=#b09176]Q: The hair is purple and blocky.  It doesn\\'t look right.[/color][/b][/size]\r\nA: You are most likely running this mod without the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168/?tab=2&navtag=/ajax/modimages/?user=0|:|id=10168]ApachiiSkyHair[/url] mod. Read the Installation section of this page for more details.\r\n\r\n[size=2][b][color=#b09176]Q:  Can I marry the followers?[/color][/b][/size]\r\nA:  Yes, the Temptress followers can be married. Please be nice to your new wife.\r\n\r\n[size=2][b][color=#b09176]Q:  Are the voices for the followers from the vanilla game?[/color][/b][/size]\r\nA:  Yes, the voices use the standard audio files for dialogue.\r\n\r\n[size=2][b][color=#b09176]Q:  What classes are the different followers?[/color][/b][/size]\r\nA: Chloe, Eliza and Vixen are Rangers. Jasmin and Sasha are Two-Handed Warriors.\r\n\r\n[size=2][b][color=#b09176]Q:  I really like the mod but I want to play as a vampire. Is there any chance that you could add another version without the immunity to disease? [/color][/b][/size]\r\nThe Temptress Race is now vampire compatible, (August 2012).  It works with or without Dawnguard.  Please note that the glowing eyes is only for the Dawnguard users.  You will need to install the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9717]Better Vampires[/url] mod and the Temptress Vampire Compatibility update. You will also have to use the console and type [i]player.setrace TemptressRaceVampire[/i] in order to be a full fledged vampire.  Please review the install instructions or change log for more details.\r\n\r\n[size=2][b][color=#b09176]Q: Could you make a replacer for the normal races?[/color][/b][/size]\r\nA: No.  However it is very easy for you to do it.  Simply use the existing Temptress files (textures/meshes) and put them in the default locations to replace the normal races.  Vixen was originally a Nord and used the files that you are now using for the Temptress Race.  \r\n\r\nPlease note, the files include the UNP body.  However you can download the CBBE body and matching femalehead files and still follow the instructions below.\r\n\r\n[b]Follow these instructions:[/b]\r\nCopy the files within:\r\n[color=#ccc8c0][i]C:\\\\...\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\temptress\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\female[/i][/color]\r\nto\r\n[color=#ccc8c0][i]C:\\\\...\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\female[/i][/color]\r\n\r\nCopy the files within\r\n[color=#ccc8c0][i]C:\\\\...\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\meshes\\\\temptress\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets[/i][/color]\r\nto\r\n[color=#ccc8c0][i]C:\\\\...\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\meshes\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\character assets[/i][/color]\r\n\r\n[size=2][b][color=#b09176]Q: **Dark Brotherhood Spoiler** - Chef Gianna in Solitude is missing a dialog option and I can\\'t continue. (During the [i]To Kill an Empire[/i] questline.)[/color][/b][/size] \r\nThe glitch is known for custom races.  To continue, bring up your console by hitting the tilde (`) key and type [i]setstage db09 30[/i].\r\n\r\n[size=2][b][color=#b09176]Q: I’ve tried everything. My Skyrim game is fully up to date. I have only Apachii SkyHair and Temptress Race installed. I’m running on a clean save and my PC specs are top notch... but I’m still having serious issues. What should I do ?[/color][/b][/size]\r\nA: Remember that homeless guy on the corner of 5th and Main ? You should’ve given him the change in your pocket because now he’s put a curse on you and you’ll never get this mod to run !!! J/K - Honestly, if you still can’t get it to run, then its just not meant to be. We are truly sorry you could not get the mod to run, but thank you nonetheless for your interest in our work.\r\n\r\n[size=2][b][color=#b09176]Q: It would be great if you guys could do this or change that and add this or take away that...[/color][/b][/size]\r\nA: Yes, it would be great if we could lock ourselves in a room for the next month, creating specialized versions of this mod for each and every request. But seriously,  we are just gamers doing this for fun and sharing it with the Nexus community.\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy our vision for what it is and don’t forget to endorse. We truly do appreciate it !\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7225/7169979465_169a1822c5_b.jpg[/img]\r\n[size=4][b][color=#b09176]Once upon a time...[/color][/b][/size]\r\nPsychos1s was inspired to create this mod after several private message and comment requests by players wanting to be able to play as Vixen or use her as a follower. Vixen was created by Psychos1s during his main playthrough of the game.  After getting addicted to taking images to showcase as art on Skyrim Nexus, he started modifying the face texture to get the custom look he desired.  \r\n\r\nVixen started becoming popular in the image section of Skyrim Nexus.  During this time, Psychos1s soon realized all his favorite UNP armor sets were made by the same individual–Brokefoot.  After several private messages back and forth, Brokefoot gave Psychos1s a headstart WIP version of the Leah Armor set to promote with his imagery.  This lead to an online friendship and the talk of making the Vixen mod a reality.  \r\n\r\nThe goal was to create Vixen in a way that would allow EVERYONE to be able to see her how she was meant to be seen without having to download other mods.  We wanted to eliminate the, “If you want her to look like she does in the screenshots please download all these additional mods...”  This eventually became a reality excluding the ApachiiSkyHair mod. \r\n\r\nIt started as a back and forth job with both trying to learn the creation kit as they were going along.  Psychos1s had no Creation Kit or modding experience and Brokefoot was mainly an armor mashup guru. Nothing was easy and it seemed they were taking one step forward and two steps back each and every day.  Somehow during the process Brokefoot took the mod by the reins and basically was handling all of the custom race issues himself.  Psychos1s would jump in every once in awhile but the majority of the race mod was created by Brokefoot.  While Brokefoot was busy on the mod and working out all the kinks, he gave responsibility of the custom Temptress presets, graphic design work and follower creation to Psychos1s.  They’d like to note, the Chloe preset was in fact made by Brokefoot. \r\n\r\nThey also decided they couldn’t release a new custom race without a new custom armor set made by Brokefoot.  Brokefoot created the Temptress Armor with Psychos1s serving as client per se sharing his thoughts, opinions and expectations.\r\n\r\nAfter several weeks this mod was born.  Please remember we are just gamers like yourselves and have families and real lives of our own.  We are not professional game developers and this mod should not be taken as such a product.  There could potentially be bugs, some of which may never get resolved.  This mod was made as a challenge to overcome and to share the creative work of Brokefoot and Psychos1s.\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7120/7417109560_2306c4c9a4_b.jpg[/img]\r\n[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7222/7380194210_18e4df06c5.jpg[/img][youtube]xbDWv2wVXrk[/youtube][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7095/7380221928_5873216277.jpg[/img]\r\n[center][size=4][b][color=#b09176]Brodual[/color][/b][/size][/center]\r\n[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7091/7380265718_07f120205f.jpg[/img][youtube]PrP8Z-e8J9M[/youtube][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7241/7380265804_f071c32bdd.jpg[/img]\r\n[center][size=4][b][color=#b09176]MxR[/color][/b][/size][/center]\r\n[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7234/7380265854_548c666df4.jpg[/img][youtube]gbobazfCg5k[/youtube][img]http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5152/7380265692_a16ce1fded.jpg[/img]\r\n[center][size=4][b][color=#b09176]WhySoSirius[/color][/b][/size][/center]\r\n[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7091/7380265718_07f120205f.jpg[/img][youtube]NHhAvXf_zkY[/youtube][img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7241/7380265804_f071c32bdd.jpg[/img]\r\n[center][size=4][b][color=#b09176]ZexusGaming[/color][/b][/size][/center]\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7236/7169979661_11a6558f27_b.jpg[/img]\r\n[size=4][b][color=#b09176]Texture / Armor / Clothing credits list[/color][/b][/size]\r\nPsychos1s and Brokefoot would like to personally thank the following:\r\n\r\n[color=#b09176]BellaGail[/color] - for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812/?tab=2&navtag=/ajax/modimages/?user=0|:|id=2812]Better Females by Bella[/url]\r\n[color=#b09176]Navetsea[/color] - for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6554]CBBE skin texture V2 V3 plus Thepal and UNP compatible[/url]\r\n[color=#b09176]Apachii[/color] - for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168/?tab=2&navtag=/ajax/modimages/?user=0|:|id=10168]ApachiiSkyHair[/url]\r\n[color=#b09176]Dimon99[/color] - for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709]DIMONIZED UNP female body[/url]\r\n[color=#b09176]Expired6978[/color] - for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6923]Extended Slider Colors[/url]\r\n[color=#b09176]Anano[/color] - for the collar, sleeves and panties [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=3496215]Anano\\'s Profile[/url]\r\n[color=#b09176]Brokefoot[/color] - for the Vicky shorts (original port by fizz99) [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13528]Dark Wind Armor[/url]\r\n[color=#b09176]Calyps[/color] - for the arm bands [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12070]Nightshade Armor[/url]\r\n[color=#b09176]Fraper[/color] - for the gloves* and boots* [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5135]Triss Outfit for TES V Skyrim[/url]\r\n[color=#b09176]Kurese[/color] - for the amulet and shirt [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15529]R18Pn Inner Wear Set[/url]\r\n[color=#b09176]MAK07[/color] - for the arm straps [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13004]Remodeled Armor CBBEv3M[/url]\r\n[color=#b09176]Petrovich[/color] - for the belt [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=16658]UNP Simply Clothes[/url]\r\n[color=#b09176]Sesamin[/color] - for the cloak [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13378]Vanilla Combination Outfit[/url]\r\n[color=#b09176]SydneyB[/color] - for the bracers, stockings and leg straps [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=18008]Ashara Princess of the Woods[/url]\r\n[color=#b09176]Magix30[/color] - for help with the [i]femalehead_sk.dds[/i] to help with the face discoloration in afternoon lighting.\r\n[color=#b09176]IsharaMeradin[/color] - for your continuous guidance and support in the comment section of this mod. \r\n[color=#b09176]TMPhoenix[/color] - for the RaceCompatibility Addition.\r\n[color=#b09176]TTek[/color] - for the CBBE v3.2 neck seam fix.\r\n\r\n*[color=#6f6f6f][i]The original Triss armor concept, mesh and textures are owned and copyrighted by CD Projekt and used here with permission.
