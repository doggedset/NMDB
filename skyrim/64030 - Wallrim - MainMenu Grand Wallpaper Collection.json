  "descriptionHtml": "[u][size=3][b]Description:[/b][/size][/u]\r<br />\r<br />I love the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3708/?]wallpaper replacer and randomizer[/url] created by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1535027/?]hellstrom102[/url], but I was kind of disappointed with most images selected. At the same time, I love the first wallpaper he provides and so I decided to explore that layout by changing the image on it.\r<br />\r<br />Therefore, I&#39;ve come up with 201 wallpapers using the same layout. Each of them has its own folder and they can be easily erased if it doesn&#39;t fit your taste. It uses [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1535027/?]hellstrom102[/url] randomizer to make all images random every time you start the game. It&#39;s a combination of ingame wallpapers and artwork made by artists inside and outside the community.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=3]Installation:[/size][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[list=1][*][size=2]Via MO or NMM or manually, the archives have the proper folder structure.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]Tastes vary and if there is any wallpaper that you don&#39;t like you can simply erase the folder where it is located (the whole folder - that is - if you don&#39;t like wallpaper &#34;DF&#34; just erase the whole &#34;DF&#34; folder from [i]mainmenuwallpapers[/i]. [i]Remember that each folder you erase makes that wallpaper vanish from the selection of wallpapers presented in the game&#39;s main menu. [/i]To avoid going through all the folders in search of those you don&#39;t like, I&#39;ve uploaded all the wallpapers into the images section with their name folder on them, you can easily find them that way instead. *SPOILER ALERT*[/size][/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[size=3][b][u]Optional Files:[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][size=2]Fog Remover[/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]Bethesda Logo Remover[/size]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />Just download and install with your mod manager or manually.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=3]Uninstallation:[/size][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />If using mod manager, simply uninstall it. Be sure to check Data folder and see if the [i]mainmenuwallpapers[/i] is not there. It it is, delete it.\r<br />-OR-\r<br />Manually erase the [i]mainmenuwallpapers[/i] folder in your data folder and the file rmm_plugin.dll in &#34;/Data/SKSE/Plugins&#34; folder.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][size=3]Credits\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/u][/b]This collection of wallpapers wouldn&#39;t be possible without the wonderful mod created by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1535027/?]hellstrom102[/url].\r<br />Credits also go to several artists in the DeviantART community such as leventep, ninjatic, jjpeabody and AndreeWallin\r<br />\r<br />All the other images used were gathered here in the Nexus (thanks to all the users that uploaded their screenshots, I&#39;ve used a lot of them. I&#39;m sorry but I did not keep track of who uploaded what&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />I hope you enjoy this as much as I do as it gives a fresh intro every time&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][u]Suggestions\r<br />\r<br />[/u][/b][/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2101/?]Dragonborn Comes music replacement[/url] performed by Malukah and uploaded to Nexus with her permission by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3286776]NodusCursorius[/url].
