Thanks to the help of some very kind people (see special thanks below), I managed to get a fixed version.

So please read the requirements &#33;\r<br />\r<br />Technically, she is Breton, but I designed this character as a Succubus, with alluring curves, wings, horns and tail.

You are free to change her clothes of course, she loves it ;). See my flickr if you want some inspirations.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]STORY :\r<br />[/u][/b]\r<br />Xana is a Succubus. Until now she was just passing time by sending sexy visions of her alluring body to mortals from Fuh-Lick Urh, her own oblivion plane. But the more she looked at the mortal plane, the more she got curious about this world and its inhabitants. So she craved to go there, to encounter directly those men and mere (or &#34;amusing toys&#34;, as she calls them) and play with them. By playing, well she means more doing murderous and\r<br />sadistic actions to them and watch their reaction than anything else (afterall, what is &#34;evil&#34; in a Succubus mind ?). She managed to appear in Skyrim, because a summoner who just wanted to raise the deads, mistakenly opened a portal from his world to her plane. To thank him, she ate him, and then went out of the catacombs to find out that she is in Whiterun&#39;s Hall of the deads.  \r<br />\r<br />Then she encounters YOU (Yes, you, stop looking around, you are all alone in front of your computer...) &#33; What better ally than the Dragonborn himself (or herself) to see closer Skyrim and its darkest corners ?\r<br />\r<br />So... have fun &#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION :\r<br />[/u][/b]Race : Breton... erh, I mean Succubus &#33;\r<br />Location : Whiterun Hall fo the Dead\r<br />Spells : Fireball and Wall of fire\r<br />Weapon : Daedric sword\r<br />Combat style : Spellsword\r<br />Measurements : Secret ;) &#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]INSTRUCTIONS : How to get her beautiful wings ?\r<br />[/u][/b]\r<br />For this you will have to download the awesome[url=http://http:/www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53271/?]Animated Dragon Wings [/url]from [b]Anton0028 [/b]and its super [url=http://http:/www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57424/?]Evil wing retexture[/url] made by [b]KNIGHTMARE077[/b].\r<br />\r<br />Click the spoiler button to see an illustrated tutorial.\r<br />\r<br />[spoiler] \r<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/DXVTow][img]https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1599/24918121502_ca933f28e3_c.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/DXVTow]Step 1[/url] by [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/130390844@N07/]Thani Derstal[/url], sur Flickr\r<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/E9mUr6][img]https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1472/25036167775_23ccd23d34_c.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/E9mUr6]Step 2[/url] by [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/130390844@N07/]Thani Derstal[/url], sur Flickr\r<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/DzSG1X][img]https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1694/24668534999_41758f1ca3_c.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/DzSG1X]Step 3[/url] by [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/130390844@N07/]Thani Derstal[/url], sur Flickr[url=https://flic.kr/p/DXVTC9][img]https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1591/24918122292_b8c9462961_c.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/DXVTC9]Step 4[/url] by [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/130390844@N07/]Thani Derstal[/url], sur Flickr\r<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/E72RDJ][img]https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1524/25009818296_a39fbf2fb3_c.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/E72RDJ]Step 5[/url] by [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/130390844@N07/]Thani Derstal[/url], sur Flickr\r<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/DbYdna][img]https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1710/24409333243_d268e0381a_c.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/DbYdna]Step 6[/url] by [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/130390844@N07/]Thani Derstal[/url], sur Flickr\r<br />\r<br />[/spoiler]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]How to make her smile and look and make expressions like in thescreenshots ?\r<br />[/u][/b]If you like the way she smiles and want to reproduct this effect, justedownload and use the very useful [url=http://http:/www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/44596/?]MFG console mod [/url]from[b]kapaer[/b].\r<br />\r<br />Step 1 : Open console, click on your follower in order for her ID to appear.\r<br />\r<br />Step 2 : type &#34;mm&#34; or &#34;mp&#34; or &#34;me&#34; in order to\r<br />see the different options you have.\r<br />\r<br />Step 3 : Once you choosed your option, type the appropriate code (mm, mp or me + number) and a value between 1 and 100 (0 will erase the effect). \r<br />Ex : to make her smile --&gt; &#34;mp 4 100&#34; (respect the spaces or it won&#39;t work).

SCREENSHOTS &#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]OPTIONS :[/b][/u]\r<br />The main file is working good, but as I was told, some people apprently have problems with the tail or with the HDT highheels requirement. This is why I made some optional files for them. Tell me if they work fine. Otherwise I will try to fix them.\r<br />No tail : Quite explicit isn&#39;t it ? HDT is still used in this version., so it is just for people who don&#39;t like the tail.\r<br />No HDT : No HDT physics extension and no HDT highheels requirements. Which means no tail and different boots. \r<br />Xana Alternative tail : this tail is from HDT wearable tail mod and seems to work better for the users who have issues with the tail from the main mod. Please use this version if you want a fully working HDT tail.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]INSTALLATION :\r<br />[/u][/b]1: Press &#34;On&#34; your computer\r<br />2: Have a nice sandwich\r<br />3: Slit the throat of a goat over a pentacle while speaking aloud an incantation for Sanguine... or Santa Claus... as you want. Replace the goat with cheese if you are summoning Sheogorath.\r<br />4: Now that your computer is on, just extract the files manually to your Data folder and check the esp on NMM, or install directly with NMM (tell me if it\r<br />doesn&#39;t work)\r<br />\r<br />ENB Used in the screenshots :\r<br />Rampage Enb\r<br />Seasons of Skyrim\r<br />Rudy Enb with Snapdragon enb&#39;s Depth of field\r<br />\r<br />Future projects :\r<br />-Trying to figure out how to fix the neck seam and then fix it.\r<br />- Eventually uploading a &#34;no-tail&#34; for people who can&#39;t run correctly\r<br />HDT.\r<br />- Other followers ? who knows.... ^^\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Q&A :[/u][/b]\r<br />Q : Will you make version for other body mods ?\r<br />A : Only if I have the time and motivation. But you are free to give her your\r<br />own body and presets.\r<br />\r<br />Q : Will you add this feature or that thing to this follower ? It would be awesome &#33;\r<br />A : Sorry, but I&#39;m a beginner in modding. It would take me too much time to learn and try to add stuff. But you are free to propose and make any kind of upgrading (related quest, custom voice, animation, special effects), it would please me most if this mod evolves thanks to other modder&#39;s strenght &#33;\r<br />\r<br />Q : Your character is too this, too that, I don&#39;t like her.\r<br />A : So... what are you doing here in the first place ?\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]PERMISSIONS:\r<br />[/u][/b]You are free to do whatever you want with her.

Only two things :\r<br />- DONT MAKE MONEY OVER THIS &#33;\r<br />- GIVE ME THE CREDITS (and of course, it is always a pleasure if you ask for my\r<br />permission first ^^).\r<br />I heard that somebody used [b]Rxkx22[/b]&#39;s awesome followers mods in order tomake his own follower mod, but didn&#39;t give any credits. That&#39;s sad and disrespectful for [b]Rxkx22[/b] who used so much time and effort on it.
