  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first &#34;mod&#34; , so don&#39;t expect a 10/10 mod ( maybe a 9/10 ).\r<br />\r<br />WARNING: This replacement needs the Apachii&#39;s Hair Mod installed and activated&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This simple mod replaces the Vanilla Lydia by a blonde, light blue eyed one. Also, she&#39;s wearing the Adept level destruction outfit without hood. \r<br />\r<br />By the way, I made Lydia essential in this mod  ( not invulnerable, so you can still fighting her ) as I hate how she dies smashed by a giant, or even you kill her accidentaly while having fun with fire, you know.\r<br />\r<br />Changed Her Combat Style - She&#39;s now a combat mage, with Restoration , Conjuration, Alteration and Destruction Spells &#33; \r<br />\r<br />Restoration   - She can heal others, and herself.\r<br />Destruction   - She can use &#34; Ice Spike, Icy Spear, Ice Storm&#34;\r<br />Alteration      - She can use &#34;Invisibility&#34;\r<br />Conjuration ( best part )   - She can conjure a Dremora Lord, a Frost Atronach or even a Dragon Priest&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />More Awesome Mods, BTW&#33; :\r<br />\r<br />Apachii&#39;s SkyHair ( must have )\r<br />CBBE or UNP, both are awesome&#33; ( must have )\r<br />Open Cities SKyrim\r<br />Deadly Mutilation \r<br />Extra Encounters \r<br />LiFE ( must have )\r<br />Pinup Poser ( must have )\r<br />SOS \r<br />SkyUI ( must have )\r<br />SKSE ( must have ) \r<br />FNIS ( must have )\r<br />The Eyes of Beauty ( must have )\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />",
