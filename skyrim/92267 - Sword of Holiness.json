  "descriptionHtml": "My second skyrim mod. This weapon has the same model of the dawnbreaker, but the texture is changed to be more silvered. This weapon is fairly overpowered. It is made out of silver so it does extra damage to undead in addition to burning them. Find the weapon up the stairs of Arcadia's Cauldron. This weapon is craftable and enchantable. To craft, you need the Arcane Blacksmith perk and 5 silver &amp; quicksilver ingots, 5 leather strips, and 5 firesalts. My nexusmods username is Bronyphony.\n<br />The link to the silver texture I used: https://www.deviantart.com/lured2stock/art/Silver-Iron-2-3045743",
