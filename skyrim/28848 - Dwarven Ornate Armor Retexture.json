It took me about ten hours to do it (not in a row) so I hope you enjoy it!\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\n-Download the .RAR file.\r\n-Extract the Data folder into your Skyrim folder.\r\n-Yes to replace.\r\n-Play Skyrim and enjoy it!\r\n\r\nUnistallation:\r\n\r\n-Delete the 4 files usually located at Program files\\\\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\dwarven\\\\m",
