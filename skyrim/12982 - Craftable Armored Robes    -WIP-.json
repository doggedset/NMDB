  "descriptionHtml": "So, whoever followed this might have realized that I didn\\'t actually do anything with it for quite some time, reason being I\\'m not playing Skyrim all that much as I used to. Guess I didn\\'t forget about it either  though, considering I still checked back. That said, question is what you\\'ll be able to expect from this in the future: I still got my ideas of what to do with this and I do feel I should finish it - just got no idea when I want  to. Means I will add more things on occasion. And I will support this mod for now, if problems with it would arise. In that case you\\'d better write me a pm though, since I\\'ll get a mail notification, instead of commenting on here, simply because it\\'s unsure of when I\\'d see it.\r\n\r\n!!--------------------------------------------------------------------!!\r\n\r\n!Note: Vanilla clothing that\\'s enchanted can only be armored with the Arcane Blacksmith perk, as well as tempered afterwards! Haven\\'t figured out how to add support for both entchanted as well as unentchanted at the same time. There\\'s a work-around, but that takes time, and I\\'d rather just use some variable.\r\n\r\nAlso thought about adding the boots and hoods as well, since it\\'d only make sense, I think. Feedback would be appreciated, expecially concerning different ideas for armor stats.\r\n\r\n\r\n!!--------------------------------------------------------------------!!\r\n\r\nNew Version 0.04\r\n\r\n- Added different Monk, College, Necromancer, and Warlock attire. Only Ebony Smithing so far.\r\n- Added Archmage\\'s Robes. Only Ebony Smithing so far.\r\n- Added Black Dremora Robes. Needs Daedric Smithing.\r\n\r\n!!--------------------------------------------------------------------!!\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________________________\r\n________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, hi!\r\n\r\nThis is basically the very first mod I\\'ve ever attempted - breaking free from that paralyzing sight of a creation kit for some game and being overwhelmed with the mass of functions there seem to be, instead moving step by step into that ominous realm of modders, curious where I\\'ll end up eventually. Though, that\\'s \\\"tiny\\\" steps right there. Really tiny.\r\nThat said, I\\'ve got no experience or knowledge apart from what one can learn from watching a couple minutes of tutorials just moments ago or tinkering aroudn with scripts of several mods for personal use, eventually screwing most of those up. ;) Just sayin\\'.\r\n\r\nBut anyways...\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________________________\r\n\r\nWhat\\'s this about?\r\n________________________________________________\r\n\r\nI\\'m playing a mage right now and am on my way to useful heavy armor, since I hate being freakishly vulnerable with just them rags and robes and on top of that not skilling Regeneration or Alteration to even that out a bit. Problem is - I think some of the most amazing apparel in this game happens to be cloth, which sadly doesn\\'t give any defensive stats, but at least you look way better when going down against a horde of bandits.\r\n\r\nNow, considering there are even ways to improve heavy and light armor through smithing, it felt rather unfair to force mages to hide behind followers or thralls (which I hate), constantly healing in close-combat, or to spent gold and perks for alteration to get some wooden case keeping you locked up while foes burn you from outside. (On a sidenote, I guess I might be playing a rather unusual mage style, sneaking, backstabbing with conjured weapons, trying to ignore every other school apart from conjuration and illusion.)\r\n\r\nSo I came up wiht a solution, which I think ain\\'t in any way overpowered, and has the benefit of maintaining style and gain some sort of protection:\r\n\r\nWhy shouldn\\'t a mage be able to fortify his robes using his knowledge of the arcane arts and a certain aptitude for smithing?\r\n\r\n________________________________________________\r\n\r\nWhat this is supposed to do\r\n________________________________________________\r\n\r\nThis mod is (supposed to be) adding recipes to the workbench allowing the player to turn simple Robes or Hooded Robes into Armored versions. The idea is that one can create them once they have obtained a certain Smithing Perk (how\\'d one know about those specific materials used, if not through pratcice?) and a certain Level Perk within one of the five magic schools (Novice, Apprentice, Adept...etc.).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this mod provides the possiblity to freely change those Hooded Armored Robes to \\\"Hood-less\\\" Armored Robes, provided you got one or the other in your inventory. Somewhat a work-around, since I think changing between these two should have been implemented from the very beginning. [Normal robes can\\'t be changed so far!]\r\n\r\n________________________________________________\r\n\r\nWhat has been done so far\r\n________________________________________________\r\n\r\nSo far we\\'ve only got different kinds of robes to improve with Ebony, creating Heavy Armor, plus one Light Armor based off of Glass Smithing. Additionally, I\\'ve added the Dremora Robes to be armored with Daedric Smithing. More supposed to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----Stats-----\r\n\r\n\r\n[H-Ar]\r\n\r\n[Ebony Smithing]\r\n\r\n(Hooded) Ebony Black/Blue Robe\r\n  _Heavy Armor\r\n  _22 lbs\r\n  _30 AR\r\n  _800 Gold value\r\n  _Crafted from a normal (Hooded) Black/Blue Robe and 3 Ebony Ingots.\r\n  _Improved with 2 Ebony Ingots.\r\n\r\nMantled Ebony College Robes (three versions)\r\n  _Heavy Armor\r\n  _22 lbs\r\n  _30 AR\r\n  _800 Gold value\r\n  _Crafted with a normal Mantled College Robe and 3 Ebony Ingots.\r\n  _Improved with 2 Ebony Ingots.\r\n\r\nEbony College Robes (two versions)\r\n  _Heavy Armor\r\n  _22 lbs\r\n  _30 AR\r\n  _850 Gold value\r\n  _Crafted with a normal College Robe and 3 Ebony Ingots.\r\n  _Improved with 2 Ebony Ingots.\r\n\r\n(Hooded) Archmage\\'s Ebony Robes\r\n  _Heavy Armor\r\n  _22 lbs\r\n  _30 AR\r\n  _1000 Gold value\r\n  _Needs Arcane Blacksmith\r\n  _Crafted from a normal (Hooded) Archmage Robe and 5 Ebony Ingots.\r\n  _Improved with 4 Ebony Ingots.\r\n\r\n(Hooded) Ebony Monk/Brown/Green/Grey/Red Robes (same model, different colors)\r\n  _Heavy Armor\r\n  _22 lbs\r\n  _30 AR\r\n  _800 Gold value\r\n  _Crafted from a normal (Hooded) Monk/Brown/Green/Grey/Red Robes and 3 Ebony Ingots.\r\n  _Improved with 2 Ebony Ingots.\r\n\r\n(Hooded) Ebony Necromancer Robes\r\n  _Heavy Armor\r\n  _22 lbs\r\n  _30 AR\r\n  _800 Gold value\r\n  _Needs Arcance Blacksmith\r\n  _Crafted with a normal (Hooded) Necromancer Robe and 3 Ebony Ingots.\r\n  _Improved with 3 Ebony Ingots.\r\n\r\n(Hooded) Ebony Black Mage Robes\r\n  _Heavy Armor\r\n  _22 lbs\r\n  _30 AR\r\n  _800 Gold value\r\n  _Needs Arcance Blacksmith\r\n  _Crafted with a normal (Hooded) Black Mage Robe and 3 Ebony Ingots.\r\n  _Improved with 3 Ebony Ingots.\r\n\r\n[Daedric Smithing]\r\n\r\nDarkened Black Robes\r\n  _Heavy Armor\r\n  _33 lbs\r\n  _40 AR\r\n  _1200 Gold Value\r\n  _Crafted with a normal (Dremora) Black Robe and 6 Ebony Ingots.\r\n  _Improved with 5 Ebony Ingots.\r\n\r\n[L-Ar]\r\n\r\n(Hooded) Enhanced Thalmor Robe\r\n  _Light Armor\r\n  _6lbs\r\n  _16 AR\r\n  _620 Gold value\r\n  _Needs Glass Smithing (Note: Still listed under \\\"Elven\\\" simply because I feel it fits better.)\r\n  _Needs Arcane Smithing (Since they\\'re originally enchanted.

Simply change into a hooded version, then imrove, and change back. Will be fixed with next update.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFuture Plans\r\n________________________________________________\r\n\r\n- Once I\\'m sure this works (which it should already) I\\'ll add more robes, heavy as well as light amor, depending where I see fit, considering I doubt any kind of material woudl be suited for a mage to magically weld into fabric.\r\n- Maybe make a version which doesn\\'t depend on smithing that much, but instead on some other perk I\\'ve yet to design.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________\r\n\r\nVersion History\r\n________________________________________________\r\n\r\nVersion 0.04\r\n\r\n- Added different Monk, College, Necromancer, and Warlock attire. Only Ebony Smithing so far.\r\n- Added Archmage\\'s Robes. Only Ebony Smithing so far.\r\n- Added Black Dremora Robes. Needs Daedric Smithing.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.035\r\n-Added (Hooded) Enhanced Thalmor Robes\r\n\r\nVersion 0.03\r\n- Relocated the crafting recipes to the forge. (Change from Hood- to No-Hood-Version still at the Tanning Rack)\r\n- Added Workbench support. Now you can improve those Armored Robes!\r\n- Recipes will only show up, if you got the required robe, that way not filling up the crafting interface.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.02\r\n- Had to change place of crafting to Tanning Rack, since it doesn\\'t work on the Workbench for some reason.\r\n- Also removed the requirements for a certain lvl within a magic school for now, since those didn\\'t do anything.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.01\r\n-Initial release and immediate fix right afterwards.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________\r\n________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you got ideas of which robes to add, which materials to use, or just another idea for this, comment and I\\'ll see, if I can figure it out. =)\r\n\r\nOh, and, if someone knows how to use html-script or alike in here, I\\'d appreciate help. I feel like this post looks horrible unorganized without it. >.>",
