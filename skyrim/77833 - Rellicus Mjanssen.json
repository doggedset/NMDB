He is currently keeping a low profile in Iverstead, drinking at the Vilemyre Inn.\r<br />\r<br />He specializes in necromancy and ice spells, one handed fighting and light armor, and has a touch of sneak to help him stay under the local radar.\r<br />\r<br />He is pure vanilla, with no modded features.\r<br />\r<br />He is protected, marriageable, and the only equipment he carries is his trusty ebony sword.\r<br />[/size]",
