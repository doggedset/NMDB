  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE:  Version 2.2 with a properly fixed strings file is now up.  This should really work now.  Please let me know if there are still any enchantments texts not showing correctly.  Overwrite the old file with the new version and make sure the strings folder is in your Data folder.\r\n\r\nWarning to people with non-English versions of the game: To resolve the above bug, I had to include new strings with the file. These strings were made with the English version and are unlikely to be compatible with non-English versions. Local versions of the strings can be made using MaboroshiDaikons String Localizer utility.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nThis mod will reweight all the weapons to historically accurate weights.  At this point, only iron, steel and draugr weapons have been done along with a few unique items. Other materials such as Ebony, Glass, Dwarven and Daedric will be added once I settle on a reasonable approximation for the weights of those materials.\r\n\r\nThis mod is intended for those who appreciate accurate representations of real weapons in their games rather than a distorted depiction in favour of game balance.  There is a slight reduction in the amount of stamina used during power swings resulting from these changes, but it doesn\\'t appear to be any more than 1/3-1/4 of vanilla.  At best it might give an extra strike or two before running out of stamina.  There is no visible impact on the speed of the weapon. (Greatswords in this game are too slow compared to the real thing anyway).\r\n\r\nI\\'ve used a range of values for the weights rather than a single set weight to represent the variation that arises from smiths using different designs and techniques.  For the most part these were set randomly, however pieces that were intended to be masterworks such as the Skyforge Steel weapons and some unique weapons were set at a lower weight to represent a higher level of craftsmanship.  Similarly the Imperial steel swords were all set at a higher weight to represent the more mass produced approach that equipping an army would require.\r\n\r\nThe fictional weapons such as Orcish, Elven, etc required a bit of guessing and research to find weights that were somewhat in keeping with the lore.  For example, Orcs are supposedly superb craftsmen, so their weapons have a slightly lighter weight than iron and steel. \r\n\r\nIron, Steel and Draugr weapons have been weighted as follows:\r\nBattle Axes 5-6 lbs\r\nDaggers around 1 lbs\r\nGreatswords 5-6 lbs\r\nWar hammers 5-6 lbs\r\nMaces 2-3 lbs\r\nOne handed swords 2-3 lbs\r\nWar axes 1.5-2.5\r\nLongbow 2.5-3 lbs\r\n\r\nOrcish\r\nWar Axes 1.5-2 lbs\r\nOne handed sword 1.9-2.5 lbs\r\nMaces 2-2.8 lbs\r\nGreatswords 4.5-5.5 lbs\r\nDaggers around 1 lbs\r\nBattle axe 4.7-5.5 lbs\r\nWar hammer 5-6 lbs\r\nBow 2.5-2.8 lbs\r\n\r\nGlass & Elven\r\nOne handed swords 1.7-2.2 lbs\r\nWar hammer 4.6-5.4 lbs\r\nwar axe 1-2 lbs\r\nMace 1.7-2.3 lbs\r\nGreatsword 4-5 lbs\r\nDagger around 0.5 lbs\r\nBow 2.2-2.5 lbs\r\nBattle axe 4-5 lbs\r\n\r\nEbony, Daedric & Dwarven\r\nOne handed sword 3-4 lbs\r\nWar hammer 6-7 lbs\r\nWar Axe 2-3 lbs\r\nMace 3-4 lbs\r\nGreatsword 6-7 lbs\r\nDagger around 1.2 lbs\r\nBow 4.5-5.5 lbs\r\nBattle axe 6-7 lbs\r\n\r\nIncompatability:  Would be incompatible with any other mod that modifies weapon weights.",
