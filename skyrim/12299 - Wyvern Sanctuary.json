  "descriptionHtml": "[color=red][b]WARNING[/b][/color] Back up your saves, just in case.\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]A71VhZEW6CI[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Description[/size][/b]\n<br />A player owned cliff and cave. The Sanctuary is large and has several rooms including...\n<br />[list] [*]Bedroom \n<br />[*]Kitchen\n<br />[*]Library\n<br />[*]Blacksmith (internal and external)\n<br />[*]Alchemy (internal and external)\n<br />[*]Enchanting (internal and external)\n<br />[*]Display Room\n<br />[*]Bar with Bartender\n<br />[*]Fence\n<br />[*]Wildlife\n<br />[*]Several NPC's\n<br />[*][color=green][b]NEW[/b][/color] Signs\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][size=5]Location[/size][/b]\n<br />The cliff is directly south of Whiterun past Pelagia Farm. You have to climb a ladder to reach the cliff which is lit by a lamp. If you have trouble finding it you can use the [b]`[/b] and [b]coc wyverncliff[/b] to be sent there.  \n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Details[/size][/b]\n<br />I have had a lot of fun making this, it is my second attempt as the first didn't turn out quite right. I will not give too much away here but you should explore. It is not a small player home it is actually huge. Plenty of storage and places to see with your own friendly barkeeper and fence to boot. What more could you ask for?  \n<br />\n<br />Some one asked so I provided. There is now Shared Storage which means if you put something in a chest in Breezehome it will be in the Shared Storage chest in Proudspire Manor and in all of the other player home locations listed below, at the same time! \n<br />[list] [*][b]Breezehome[/b]* (To the left of your front door, in the Living Room)\n<br />[*][b]Honeyside[/b]* (On the bookshelf, in the Bedroom)\n<br />[*][b]Vlindrel Hall[/b]* (To the left of the door in the Hallway)\n<br />[*][b]Hjerim[/b]* (To the right of the front door, in the Living Room)\n<br />[*][b]Proudspire Manor[/b]* (Left of the front door, on a shelf in the Living Room)\n<br />[*][b]Archmage Quarters[/b] (To the left of the tree, on a barrel)\n<br />[*][b]Hall of Attainment[/b] (In room with your bed on a barrel)\n<br />[*][b]Thieves Guild Headquarters[/b] (On left after the Flaggon entrance, on a top shelf)\n<br />[*][b]Jorrvaskr Basement[/b] (In bedroom area, behind the door)\n<br />[*][b]Dawnstar Sanctuary[/b] (In bedroom, on the shelf by the bed)\n<br />[*][b]Wyvern Cliff[/b] (By the Blacksmithing area, on a crate)\n<br />[*][b]Wyvern Sanctuary Living Area[/b] (By the library, on a shelf)\n<br />[*][b]Wyvern Sanctuary Blacksmith[/b] (Left of the entrance, on a crate)\n<br />[*][b]Wyvern Sanctuary Enchanting[/b] (Right of the enchanting table)\n<br />[*][b]Wyvern Sanctuary Alchemy[/b] (Right of the Alchemy table, on the shelf)\n<br />[/list]*note- All of the player home locations will not appear until you have purchased the equivalent decorating areas.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Install[/size][/b]\n<br />1. Use NMM to install. Choose only one version. Should automatically activate once installed.\n<br />2. Manually install in Skyrim/Data folder. Activate esp in a mod loader.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Uninstall[/size][/b]\n<br />Remove your possessions from bookshelves, containers, mannequin's and display cases then save outside of the cell.\n<br />1. Use NMM\n<br />2. Delete the .esp files from your Skyrim/Data folder.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Known Issues or Bugs[/size][/b]\n<br />[list] [*]Companions will not follow you up the ladder to the cliff. This is a known bug. Just Wait an hour.\n<br />[*]The mannequin's like to wander around when you are not looking, just leave the cave and come back in. \n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][size=5]Version History[/size][/b]\n<br />[color=green][b]v1.4[/b][/color]\n<br />[list] [*]Added signs to a few areas as the cave is so large\n<br />[*]Added a few more FX\n<br />[*]Made a few dark areas light up a bit\n<br />[*]A few small fixes\n<br />[/list][color=green][b]v1.3[/b][/color]\n<br />[list] [*]Added wildlife, all friendly (well they won't attack)\n<br />[*]Several new NPC's to keep you company\n<br />[*]Fixed the roombounds for the slower computers\n<br />[*]Improved Katya's bar so the new NPC's have somewhere to eat\n<br />[*]Fixed a few more NavMesh issues\n<br />[/list][color=green][b]v1.2[/b][/color]\n<br />[list] [*]Fixed Krosis Bust not displaying mask\n<br />[*]More book storage (18 books per container)\n<br />[/list][color=green][b]v1.1[/b][/color]\n<br />[list] [*]Added Shared Storage (read above for details)\n<br />[/list][color=green][b]v1.0[/b][/color]\n<br />[list] [*]Completed Cliff\n<br />[*]Competed Sanctuary\n<br />[*]Tested Navmesh\n<br />[*]Bartender Katya\n<br />[*]Fence Karawan\n<br />[*]Tested all Display cases and Mannequins\n<br />[*]Pages and pages of bugs I personally found\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][size=5]Please[/size][/b]\n<br />I have spent roughly 9 full days on this but I'm afraid I am too close to the project to notice every problem so if there is any bug or issue do comment and I will try and fix it as soon as possible.\n<br />\n<br />Also, let me know in comments if you find the hidden area. Just wondering if anyone actually has. I did put a picture as a kinda hint!\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Please check my other mods[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]L7Y915AnlY4[/youtube]\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12851]Pinewood Village[/url]",
