  "descriptionHtml": "  Kids, I\\'m going to tell you an incredible story, the story of how I met your mother. It all started the day I was sent to Helgen to be killed, that\\'s a funny story that I\\'ll get to later...                (Insert story here).\r\n\r\n  This is a save game of a character named Ted Mosby, who has similar looks to that of Ted Mosby from the popular TV show How I met your Mother. Obviously the looks are not exact, yet with the limitations of Skyrim it\\'s not possible to be exact. He was originally just a random character I made, then one of my friends pointed out the similarities of my character to Ted. So I renamed him Ted and made this save for others to enjoy :)\r\n\r\n  Ted is a level 1 Imperial that starts out at the only place you\\'d see him, a bar! Or in this case an Inn. He starts inside The Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood.\r\n\r\n  Now go out and find the one!\r\n\r\n  Note: To be able to use him as he looks in the pictures you\\'ll need a few mods...\r\n*Better males - Beautiful nudes and faces New hairstyles  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488 by Chris57\r\n*ApachiiSkyHair (For this particular hair style you need to download the male hairs v1.0) http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168 by apachii \r\n*The Eyes Of Beauty http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722 by LogRaam\r\n ",
