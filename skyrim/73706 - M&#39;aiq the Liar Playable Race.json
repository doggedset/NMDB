  "descriptionHtml": "[b]M&#39;aiq the Liar\r<br />[/b] is a recurring source of misinformation in the [i]Elder Scrolls[/i] series, featured in Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, and Online. He was introduced by the game designers as an easter egg to provide commentaries about the [i]Elder Scrolls[/i] series. \r<br />Wherever he is found, he loves to share his opinions with those he meets on a variety of random topics including children, Colovian Fur Helms, the Companions, crossbows, dragons, fighting with one&#39;s feet, fish sticks, nudity, werewolfs, and more. He almost always speaks in third-person when spoken to, like most Khajiits. \r<br />M&#39;aiq has not directly confirmed how old he is. One of his lines in Skyrim is [i]&#34;M&#39;aiq&#39;s father was also called M&#39;aiq. As was M&#39;aiq&#39;s father&#39;s father. At least, that is what his father said.&#34;[/i], giving support to the fact that the M&#39;aiq in each game is different than the other. Considering M&#39;aiq has been around since the events of The Elder Scrolls Online, if he were to be the same character he would have had to have lived over 1,000 years, an abnormally long lifetime for a Khajiit. An Inscribed Flute in Crow&#39;s Wood reads [i]&#34;A gift from M&#39;aiq to his son, M&#39;aiq,&#34;[/i] further implying that each M&#39;aiq is not the same one as the previous, but rather related. \r<br />\r<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />I made M&#39;aiq the Liar playable Race&#33;&#33;&#33; This mod is for my friend KeMp...\r<br />KeMp wanted me to make this for him, and then we desided to upload it here in Nexus. \r<br />Feel free to make a Youtube Review. \r<br />Please do not copy or upload it, it&#39;s ilegal&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Thank you.\r<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />Note: If you don&#39;t know who M&#39;aiq the Liar is, then you have not played enough of The Elder Scrolls games...
