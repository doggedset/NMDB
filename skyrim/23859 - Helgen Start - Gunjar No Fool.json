  "descriptionHtml": "There you are, minding your own business, when you\\'re captured by Imperials, encounter the Red Queen and are about to lose your most prized possession, when a mythical creature attacks and saves your butt. Stormcloaks  scatter, heading for freedom, grabbing whatever weapons they can get their hands on. Doesn\\'t it seem reasonable you would grab the biggest, baddest weapon just lying around? Oh, that\\'s right, your hands are tied...\r\n\r\nNever fear,  Stormcloak Gunjar\\'s no fool, he grabs it for himself. Unluckily for him ( lucky for you ), he\\'s not a very accomplished fighter, so go ahead, pick it up on your way out.\r\n\r\nSimple esp edit changing Gunjar\\'s weapon drop. Also upgrades the Imperial sword\\'s damage by 2 points, for balance.\r\n\r\nManual install.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nBethesda\r\n\r\n\r\nHave fun, \r\nTG",
