Check the Dr_Bandolier.esp in your \\\"data files\\\", in the launcher. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to get:\r\nAll items are crafted at the tanning rack. However, some items may require extra things that can be crafted at the forge.\r\nBlack Dyed Leather is crafted by combining Leather and Frostbite Venom.\r\nAssorted Buckles are crafted at the forge from Steel Ingots.\r\nTo make a bandolier with a shoulderpad, you must first make a regular one, and then, combining it with an extra piece of leather at the tanning rack, you can create bandoliers with shoulderpads.\r\n(Example in the screenshots above)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note:\r\nThis is still a beta release and there might still be some bugs.
