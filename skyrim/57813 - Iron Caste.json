  "descriptionHtml": "Mod: Iron Caste Armor Set\r<br />Author: Bryanwee20\r<br />Date: 4/9/2014\r<br />Forum Link:http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/1323147-mega-armor-mash-up-collection/\r<br />\r<br />Introduction:\r<br />This mod is just a standalone from the main mod called [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50058/?][b]mega-armor-mash-up-collection[/b][/url].It includes a multi-themed armor set that leans more towards\r<br />spellsword/thief/assassin character builds. Just like the rest of the armors from the main mod, the armor is a semi-mashup and retext of vanilla armors.\r<br />\r<br />Mod Details:\r<br />The mod includes a single full armor set consisting of acuirass, a pair of gauntlets, a pair of boots and a hood. The gauntlets, boots and hood have alternate variants using different meshes. The armor set has identical stats as generic glass armor.It can be forged at any forge under the leather category. The armor requires the advance armor perk and has the same recipe as the steel plate armor. The\r<br />armor pieces are temperable. The armor does support both male and female characters. \r<br />\r<br />Dislclaimer:\r<br />Before anyone says anything, I know that the female armorhas a little clipping issue with the legs and the kilt. I will be working on\r<br />it.\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />My crappy school laptop: For not crashing anymore.",
