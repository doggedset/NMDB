  "summary": "New face, overhauled spells and perks, updated outfit and Akaviri katana as default sword, more aggressive in combat, definitely more powerful. Skilled in 1h, light armor, destruction (ice and shock) and conjuration (three custom conjuration spells and the usual necromancy). Autolevelling and essential, level 12-100.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Overhaul of Serana I did for myself, maybe others will like it so I am uploading it here.\r<br />\r<br />Her outfit is updated to include vampire gauntlets, her new default weapon is Akaviri katana which I believe is a very fitting weapon for vampires. She has the usual vampire strengths and weaknesses (she will be weaker in sunlight), uses destruction magic (ice and shock) and conjuration with three custom spells (Conjure Skeleton, Skeleton Lord, Skeleton King) and usual necromancy. She fights more aggressively now and has more perks including light foot. General idea was to make her a worthwhile companion for all levels, a companion that can hold her ground as she levels with you.\r<br />\r<br />For best results pick her up on a character that did not meet her yet. If you load old save she will not level according to new class and will be capped at vanilla level.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />Extract /meshes, /textures and SidiousSeranaOverhaul.esp to Skyrim/Data.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />\r<br />Delete SidiousSeranaOverhaul.esp and related files.",
