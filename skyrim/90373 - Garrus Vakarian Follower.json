I am uploading this here[b][i] temporarily [/i][/b]for my convenience.\n<br />\n<br />This mod should allow for a Garrus Vakarian follower (from the Mass Effect Series.) He has dialogue ported from Mass Effect, and he can be found in the Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun.\n<br />\n<br />Again, this is not my mod! Download it at your own risk! I'm currently working on adapting it for SSE, and maybe (this is a huge maybe) making him a marriageable character.
