  "descriptionHtml": "DESCRIPTION------------------\r\n\r\nA Dwemer Style medium sized Underground Starter Player Home located in the Lake Illinalta \r\nwith every necessary amenities and labelled storage containers. Fully Navmeshed and ready for companions (except the secret temple), full crafting and storage.\r\n\r\nThe House has been decorated with mostly static objects with very little to no havok objects at all. If you actually enjoy \\\"kicking the food off the table...\\\" then this is probably not the mod for you.\r\n\r\nThe House is located right off the path towards falkreath in the lake illinalta (Location in Screenshots). The Location makes it a good starter home.\r\n\r\nI tried to employ the \\\"just in time lighting\\\" scripts to the fullest potential but its very nature and the way it works leaves behind some snags here and there in a open hall type house mod like this. Especially in the Main hall. If it breaks the immersion for you then i am truly sorry.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION-----------------\r\n\r\nManual Installation - Download the archive, Unpack it and Copy the Data Folder, Paste it into your SKYRIM folder.\r\nActivate \\\"Dome of The Rock.esp\\\" from Skyrim config data files section or using your preferred mod manager.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS-----------------\r\n\r\nSkyrim Patch 1.9.32.0.8.

You Guys Rightfully deserve all those endorsements.\r\n\r\nThen I would like to thank all those guys who created all the third party content i have used in this mod. Thank you for allowing us to use your resources without permission.\r\n\r\nBlary - Blary\\'s Resources   http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/2250922/?tb=mods&pUp=1\r\nOaristys and Tony67 - Modders Resource Pack  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16525//?\r\nDaemonjax - Just in Time Lighting Scripts  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10361//?\r\nSydzilla - Markarth City Banner Re-texture   http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18732//?\r\n\r\nLastly....\r\n\r\nBethesda - Thanks for a great game.\r\nNexus site/staff - Thanks for making a great place to share our creativity.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit where its due !!!\r\n\r\nKNOWN ISSUES----------------\r\n\r\nAs of Yet None in terms of Fatal Game-Breaking Bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES--------------\r\n\r\n1. The Lighting of this mod was not created with any other lighting add-on in mind.\r\n   How you want to play your game is your own business. But let me warn you that add-ons like,\r\n   for example RLO might make the interior lighting over-bright and really bad. \r\n   At least it doesn\\'t suit my tastes.....A good suggestion maybe is to turn off the RLO - Dungeons plugin.\r\n\r\n2. I am not a regular modder. \r\n   Neither modding nor playing games is something i do every day \r\n   nor do i get enough time to visit/revisit this site. \r\n   I tried my level best to make this mod as perfect as possible at one go simply because \r\n   I really don\\'t think I will be able to keep track of bugs appearing \r\n   or requests to add more to the mod. \r\n   Keep this things in mind and always read descriptions properly before using any game/mod/tool/anything. It saves a lot of time !!!",
