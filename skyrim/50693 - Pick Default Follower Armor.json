  "summary": "This mod allows you to dynamically change the default outfit of any follower to any custom outfit of your choosing, through dialogue options.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[color=yellow]Version 3.0 is up&#33; It&#39;s (another) overhaul of the mod. Now it&#39;s even easier to use as everything can be done through dialogue. There&#39;s no more need to travel to Breezehome to do anything.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Summary[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />By default, followers have a predefined armor that they wear if they think it&#39;s better than what you&#39;ve given them, or when you send them back home. This mod allows you to pick a new default outfit for each follower through dialogue options, which gives you more control over what they choose to wear.\r<br />\r<br />This mod has no requirements, and should be compatible with any other mod that changes existing followers since I&#39;m not touching them directly. It should also be compatible with mods that add their own followers.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Features[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />This mod allows you to:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Set up 5 custom outfit slots, and assign them to your followers individually\r<br />[*] Ask your follower to use a vanilla outfit, like sets of clothes, leather, iron or steel armors.\r<br />[*] Ask your follower to not use any clothes. (note that they will eventually use armor if you leave some in their inventory)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[u][b]Usage[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />Any follower should now have a new dialogue branch to select a new outfit. Everything is done in there. If you select a custom outfit, the inventory window will open so you can put your items there. You can reuse that same outfit on multiple followers.\r<br />\r<br />The different slots are just there to provide you with different options that you can swap to on the fly.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Caveats[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />Note that they have to be following you at the time. They won&#39;t show the option if they&#39;re available to follow you, but aren&#39;t doing so at the moment.\r<br />\r<br />Also, note that if they&#39;re wearing armor that you&#39;ve given them, and you select the option for them to pick a new outfit, any items they&#39;re actively wearing WILL BE LOST. Make sure they&#39;re not wearing anything valuable.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Installation[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />Simply install with NMM. \r<br />\r<br />Otherwise, download the file, decompress it (with www.7-zip.org for example), copy the resulting files to your Skyrim&#39;s Data folder, and then activate the plug-in in Skyrim&#39;s launcher.\r<br />\r<br />Either way, the following two files must be in the Data folder:\r<br />PickDefaultFollowerArmor.esp\r<br />PickDefaultFollowerArmor.bsa\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Version History[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[b]3.0[/b]\r<br />- New mechanic for everything to be done through dialogues. The chests used in the previous versions are now gone from Breezehome.\r<br />\r<br />[b]2.1[/b]\r<br />- Added a message that shows up if you select an outfit that has no clothing or armor items in it, to provide instructions in-game.\r<br />\r<br />[b]2.01[/b]\r<br />- Fixed a scripting bug that messed with controls after taking items out of the chests\r<br />\r<br />[b]2.0[/b]\r<br />- All hard-coded outfits were erased\r<br />- New mechanic to allow the players to make their own outfits\r<br />\r<br />[b]1.1[/b]\r<br />- Added many more options to the outfit selection\r<br />\r<br />[b]1.0[/b]\r<br />- Initial release",
