  "descriptionHtml": "What:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a series of defensive enchantments, loosely based on the alteration defensive spells.\r\n\r\nThe enchantments are specific to their designated article of clothing, are not compatible with any sort of armor, and have fixed stats.\r\n\r\nEach enchantment has a secondary characteristic that uniformly scales across all levels of potency.\r\n\r\nEach set of enchantments is available on a simple set of clothes from various sellers of magical items. Iron, Ebon, and Dragon are only available once you have reached a level of 50, 75, and 100* in some school of magic.\r\n\r\n*Dragon is only available from the teachers of each school in Winterhold and only after you\\'ve completed their ritual to unlock the strongest spells.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enchantments are as follows:\r\n\r\nOak Cloak           +25 Armor Rating     5% Fire Resist\r\nOak Foot            +7 Armor Rating       5% Frost Resist\r\nOak Fist              +7 Armor Rating      +4 Unarmed\r\nOak Face            +11 Armor Rating     5% Shock Resist\r\n\r\nStone Cloak         +35Armor Rating     10% Fire Resist\r\nStone Foot          +10Armor Rating     10% Frost Resist\r\nStone Fingers      +10Armor Rating      +6 Unarmed\r\nStone Cap           +15Armor Rating      10% Shock Resist\r\n\r\nIron Cloak           +50 Armor Rating      15% Fire Resist\r\nIron Foot            +15 Armor Rating      15% Frost Resist \r\nIron Palm            +15 Armor Rating      +8 Unarmed\r\nIron Skull            +20 Armor Rating      15% Shock Resist\r\n\r\nEbon Cloak          +70 Armor Rating      20% Fire Resist\r\nEbon Foot           +21 Armor Rating      20% Frost Resist\r\nEbon Hand          +21 Armor Rating      +10 Unarmed\r\nEbon Mind          +28 Armor Rating       20% Shock Resist\r\n\r\nDragon Hide        +100Armor Rating      25% Fire Resist\r\nDragon Bones      +30 Armor Rating       25% Frost Resist\r\nDragon Claws       +30 Armor Rating      +15 Unarmed\r\nDragon Intellect   +40 Armor Rating      25% Shock Resist\r\n\r\n\r\nHow:\r\n\r\n\r\nEach set of enchantments is scaled to be slightly less effective than a corresponding set of light armor with an assumed Light-Armor level comparable to the magic school level that unlocks them and the available perks.\r\n\r\nOak is slightly weaker than a set of leather armor on a character with a Light-Armor skill of 15 and no perks.\r\n\r\nStone is slightly weaker than a set of Elven armor on a character with a Light-Armor skill of 25 and a 20% boost from perks.\r\n\r\nIron is slightly weaker than a set of scaled armor on a character with a Light-Armor skill of 50 and a 40% boost from perks.\r\n\r\nEbon is slightly weaker than a set of glass armor on a character with a Light-Armor skill of 75 and a 60% boost from perks.\r\n\r\nDragon is weaker than a set of Dragonscale armor on a character with a Light-Armor skill of 100 and a 100% boost from perks.\r\n\r\nAll assume the is no shield.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strength of each garment enchantment is based on the apparent trend for armor sets. \r\n\r\nBody pieces are about 50% of the total defense.\r\nGauntlets and Boots are each about 15%.\r\nHelms are about 20%.\r\n\r\nThe resistances and unarmed boost are for flavor purposes. \r\nMages would build in magical resistances; it just makes sense. \r\nThe unarmed combat boost is the reasonable effect of having harder hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy:\r\n\r\n\r\nI found the lack of defensive enchantments to be an odd ommission.\r\nThe use of shield spells is at best an incredibly annoying substitute.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the first mod I\\'ve made whole-cloth after tinkering with the guts of other mods to make them suit me better.\r\n",
