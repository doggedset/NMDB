  "descriptionHtml": "FMEE Fortify Magic Effect Enchantments\r\nPreviously known as FDDE Fortify Destruction Damage Enchantment\r\n\r\nThis mod adds 5 enchanted items to the game, 2 rings, 2 amulets and a circlet all enchanted with fortify effects you would get from drinking a potion.\r\n- Fortify Destruction Damage\r\n- Fortify Illusion Strength\r\n- Fortify Alteration Duration\r\n- Fortify Conjuration Duration\r\n- Fortify Restoration Strength\r\nAll items can be disenchanted. With enchantment of 100 you can enchant a new item to 25 value, enchant 4 different items to get bonus of 100 value.\r\nThe items are scattered all over Skyrim. Read the readme for locations and console commands to add them.\r\n**********************************************************************************************************************************\r\n08.02.2012\r\nMAJOR UPDATE: v2.0\r\nWith the release of the Construction Kit, I have been able to do justice to this mod and make it what it should have been. The effects are now stack-able and I have added 4 new items for the other schools of magic and I have scattered them throughout Skyrim. Detailed descriptions on how to obtain these items are in the readme.\r\n\r\n**********************************************************************************************************************************\r\nUPDATE:\r\nA few hours after I released this mod, a mod that does a better job than mine came out, making this download obsolete. \r\nPlease use Proper Fortify Magic Power Enchantments as it gives you much more options.\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6422\r\n\r\n***********************************************************************************************************************************\r\nFirst Release v1.0\r\nThis mod adds a ring called \\\"Ring of Power\\\" to the game. The ring is enchanted with the fortify destruction damage by 20%. The ring can be disenchanted and a new enchantment called \\\"Fortify Destruction Damage\\\" is added to the list of available enchantments. Since this is based on the alchemy fortify destruction, the rings description says \\\"Destruction spells are 20% stronger for <0> seconds\\\". I have not been able to change the description to just \\\"Destruction spells are 20% stronger.\\\". Also, the enchantment effects do not stack, same as for potions, but with enchanting on 100 you can make an item with 50% destruction damage increase. The ring is located in Septimus Signus cupboard.",
