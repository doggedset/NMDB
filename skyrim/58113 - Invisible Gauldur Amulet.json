  "descriptionHtml": "Hello to all. This is my very first mod. I uploaded a couple of files to the good old Oblivion nexus, but i had never tried the CS... Till now :)\r<br />\r<br />I love the Gauldur Amulet, especially thanks to some mods that make it more [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8485/?]powerful[/url] or [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53694/?]armored[/url].\r<br />However, i hate how it looks and how it clips with everything. Having tried a couple of invisible jewelry mods, i found out that the model for this amulet had not been made invisible, so i decided to try the Construction Set and do it myself.\r<br />\r<br />It turned out to be pretty easy. I spent 5 minutes making this, 3 of them loading the main file, without any tutorial. The CS looks cool.\r<br />\r<br />I decided to upload it in case anyone finds it useful. Should be compatible with any mod that alters the properties of the amulet, but load this one later. I made it work with the armored amulet mod.",
