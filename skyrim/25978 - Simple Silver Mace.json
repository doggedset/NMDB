  "descriptionHtml": "I was a little upset about the fact that there were no Silver Maces in the game, as I see maces as the weapons of holy individuals.\r\n\r\nI simply added a Mace with the \\\"SilverPerk\\\", same as the Silver Sword/Greatsword.\r\n\r\nIt was a simple edit, and it uses the Iron Mace model. I\\'ve added it to the level list used by the Vigilants of Stendarr, so you should be able to find them on various members.\r\n\r\nThis is my first released mod, so I hope someone gets some use out of it.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve tested it on a few undead enemy types alongside the Silver Sword. Let me know if anything breaks when you try it out, though, it REALLY should not.",
