  "summary": "Bedrolls & Haybunks placed at a few locations where it seemed to make sense you\\'d be able to sleep. Bed ownership modified at a few others.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds or modifies sleepable surfaces at locations around the world to let the player rest at locations where it seems logical they\\'d be able to.\r\n\r\nFull list as follows:\r\nAngi\\'s Camp (by the workbench)\r\nBard\\'s College (downstairs, general quarters area)\r\nBrinehammer Ship wreak (lower hold)\r\nBthalft (lower area)\r\nCrabber\\'s Shanty (fisherman\\'s bed)\r\nFroki\\'s Shack (kid\\'s bedroll)\r\nGreywater Grotto (by corpse at the end chest)\r\nHaemar\\'s Shame (first room, by thrall spawn)\r\nHalfmoon Mill (in the meathouse)\r\nHeartwood Mill (among the chickens)\r\nHigh Htrothgar (by idle pilgrim)\r\nHonningbrew Meadery (main building, upstairs by the other bedroll. Thieves guild only)\r\nHunter\\'s Rest (hunter bedrolls)\r\nLost Echo Cave (by pillar in brazier/main room)\r\nPalagia Farm (stable building on the hill, among the hay)\r\nMzulft Storeroom (main room)\r\nReachwind Eyrie (at entrance)\r\nRiften, Beggar\\'s Row (first bedroll on the left)\r\nSarethi Farm (among the chickens)\r\nShor\\'s Stone (on smith\\'s porch)\r\nSouthfringe Sanctum (in tent by the anvil)\r\nStony Creek Cave (by treasure chest)\r\n\r\nAll of these are placed or modified to blend these into the surroundings as seemlessly as possible. Other locations may follow as I come across them. Surgestions welcome but keep in mind the idea is to keep this mod simple and relatively light.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Dawnguard makes some changes to the game world at some of these locations. I believe I\\'ve adjusted all placements so they no longer look out of place if you use Dawnguard, but let me know if I missed any! \r\nDawnguard is NOT required for this mod.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso available on Steam.",
