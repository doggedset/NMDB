  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=5]ASHARA FROSTFALL CAPES\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=4]UPDATE INFORMATION\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]This mod will now work on males as well as females.  Standalone options are now available for those who do not want all the additional clothes & accessories in &#34;Ashara Princes of the Woods for UNP & Male&#34;.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]SydneyB for the creation of these beautiful cloaks & hoods&#33;&#33;&#33;  Full credit goes to her for making these lovely garments - I have simply adapted them to work with Chesko&#39;s brilliant game enhancing mod &#34;Frostfall&#34; & made them optionally standalone for those who don&#39;t want the large amount of attire included in her original mod.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />MOD DESCRIPTION\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]This mod converts the capes from &#34;Ashara Princes of the Woods for UNP & Male&#34; so that they provide exposure & rain protection for Frostfall.\r<br />\r<br />There are now two options: the Adapter version requires the original Princes of the Woods mod & converts the meshes & esp data to be compatible with Frostfall; the Standalone versions add the Frostfall compatible cloaks & their matching hoods to your game without requiring the original mod.\r<br />\r<br />In the Adapter the only changes made are those necessary to make the capes work with Frostfall - everything else remains exactly as SydneyB intended.\r<br />SydneyB&#39;s mod &#34;Ashara Princes of the Woods for UNP & Male&#34; [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18008]www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18008[/url] is required for this version to work - use your mod manager to merge your Adapter file with Princes of the Woods by giving it the exact same name, selecting merge & then overwriting if prompted (or manually replace the Princes of the Woods esp & relevant meshes with the ones in this mod).\r<br />\r<br />In the Standalone versions you can choose a file that will only add unarmoured capes & hoods, or one that will also add both light & heavy armoured versions.\r<br />The items are named as follows:\r<br />Cape or Hood: Embellished - Colour\r<br />Cape or Hood Light: Embellished - Colour\r<br />Cape or Hood Heavy: Embellished - Colour\r<br />All the colour variants are included (green, olive, grey, black, brown & red).\r<br />They can all be made at the tanning rack with 1-3 linen wraps, 1 leather strips, 1 glass (for the gilding) & 2 colourants (bone meal/iron ore/clay/red mountain flower).  To help prevent cluttering in your crafting menu the recipes will only show up if you have at least 1 linen wrap in your inventory.\r<br />As they have a high quality appearance the items are worth triple their crafting price (approx. 40g for capes & 20g for hoods, with armoured versions being slightly more expensive).\r<br />Hearthfire is required for the Standalone options to work, but you do not need &#34;Ashara Princes of the Woods for UNP & Male&#34;.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]For those confused by the use of red mountain flower in the green & olive cloaks this has been done to retain consistency with the clothing/armor recipes in my other mods (which use the leaves of red mountain flower for green items).[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />MY OTHER MODS\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Linen Wrap Fabric Retexture & Optional Clothing Recipes\r<br />Craftable Ulfric Clothes\r<br />Horses of Skyrim\r<br />Black Shadowmere\r<br />Corporeal Arvak\r<br />Did You Pay For That?[/size][/size][/center]",
