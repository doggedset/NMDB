  "descriptionHtml": "Tired of hearing about how peaceful the journey is to High Hrothgar by a pilgrim, only to have poor Barknar mauled by a bear 20 seconds later? This mod basically removes all of the added hostile animals and other NPC&#39;s on the way up to the monastery.\r<br />\r<br />This will NOT remove any NPC&#39;s on the way to the very top of the mountain past High Hrothgar, only to High Hrothgar. If you&#39;re at the point where you need to go to the top, enemies shouldn&#39;t be a problem anyway, and Arngeir said it would be treacherous, so there&#39;s that.\r<br />\r<br />Installation: It&#39;s only one .esp file. Place it in data. You don&#39;t need NMM for that.\r<br />\r<br />Because: Load order does not matter, really at all. Unless you use Warbug&#39;s Paper Map, it can go anywhere in your load order. (Place it above map mods, but place it below Interesting NPC&#39;s if you use that.) Personally I put it in the middle, but it really doesn&#39;t matter either way. It only edits the markers for leveled predators and does nothing more and nothing less. (Well, okay, I lied. I don&#39;t have it in the middle. I actually copied all the records into a different esp file in tes5EDIT to save space because I&#39;m coming up on the 255 cap and it still works just as fine, in case you were thinking about merging this file.)\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility: Not incompatible with anything, as far as I know. The records that were changed were not changed in any other mod I use, including things like SkyTEST and other mods that change wildlife. Like I stated above, this mod needs to be placed above Warbug&#39;s paper map if you use that, but other than that, it&#39;s completely safe to be anywhere in your load order.\r<br />WARNING: If you use Interesting NPC&#39;s, you have to download the Interesting NPC&#39;s version. Only download ONE file.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation: remove the .esp file. This mod contains no scripts or dirty edits that will damage your save. It only removes the enemy spawners and you can easily remove this mod if you decide for some reason you want them back.\r<br />\r<br />Optional files: There is an optional file to keep the iconic Frost Troll on the cliff right before you reach High Hrothgar. I decided to make this optional because it is basically what makes sure you don&#39;t start the main quest at too early of a level. The developers put that Frost Troll there to make sure you&#39;re sort of &#34;worthy&#34;, in a sense, to go to Hrothgar. If you can kill it, you can go there. This is the lore friendly version in my opinion, and it&#39;s the one I use.",
