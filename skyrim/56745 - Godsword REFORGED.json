  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#1155cc]Ever get tired of having your face get handed to you by combat overhauls? Or just feel like you want to have some fun? THEN THIS MOD IS FOR YOU&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#cc0000]I was wrong about the previous damage, i suggest this sword for lower lvls, maybe 1-25 it has around 250 damage. As i played with a combat overhaul it seemed VERY different. This sword hits 15x fast as a regular sword and it has the reach of 30 swords.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f4f4f4]What does it do? [/color][color=#ff0000]This sword does a ton of damage. Mine says 800 but i am playing with a combat overhaul. So originally, I had 300 added. Also it has tons of reach. Its downright broken. And it swings very very quick and very very hard.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#0000ff]Also you should note that this sword levels up one handing faster than anything I&#39;ve ever seen. So if you&#39;re a mage or a two handed warrior and just want to level up one handing just for the perks and levels this is great.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f4f4f4][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/edit/?id=56713#]Install[img]http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png[/img][/url] method: [/color][color=#ff0000]Please use NMM. it is very easy and good to use.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#6fa8dc]Uninstall Method: [/color][color=#000000]Remove it from your inventory, and deactivate the mod.[/color]\r<br />[color=#0000ff]\r<br />\r<br />[/color][color=#f4f4f4]Where to find? [/color][color=#000000]The bannered mare, in whiterun.
