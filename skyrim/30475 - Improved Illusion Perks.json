  "descriptionHtml": "After playing Skyrim as a warrior for a long time, i decided to create a mage .... but all magic trees were horrible and too weak to the point of even being a joke. Except alteration, and if playing a vamp, restoration. Conjuration was OK, but destruction and illusion were not :(\r\nWhile i found lots of mods to improve/revamp destruction/conjuration perks, i had trouble finding an illusion changing mod that didn\\'t overpowered the spells. \r\nso this is my response to that problem.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mod do\r\n - It increases the number of Illusion perks by increasing the ranks of a few perks\r\n - Increase the level of the enemies affected by illusion spells\r\n - Makes a few more perks worth choosing :P\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\nQuiet casting -> no changes (but once again, why is this an illusion spell?)\r\n\r\nIllusion dual casting -> no changes (didn\\'t feel the need to)\r\n\r\nNovice illusion -> increases lvl affected creature by 1\r\nApprentice illusion -> increases lvl affected creature by 2\r\nadept illusion -> increases lvl affected creature by 3\r\nexpert illusion -> increases lvl affected creature by 4\r\nmaster illusion -> increases lvl affected creature by 5\r\n(total-> +15 lvls)\r\n\r\nMaster of the mind -> increases lvl affected creature by 5 (so, total +20lvls of affected creatures)\r\n\r\nAnimage (before 1 rank +8lvl) -> 3 ranks\r\nrank1 -> +3lvls\r\nrank2 -> +3lvls(total+6)\r\nrank3 -> +3lvls(total+9)\r\n\r\n\r\nkindred mage (1 rank +10lvls) -> 3 ranks (+12lvls)\r\nrank1 -> +4lvls\r\nrank2 -> +4lvls(total+8)\r\nrank3 -> +4lvls(total+12)\r\n\r\n\r\nHypnotic Gaze (1rank +8lvls) -> 3ranks (+9lvls)\r\nrank1 -> +3lvls\r\nrank2 -> +3lvls(total+6)\r\nrank3 -> +3lvls(total+9)\r\n\r\n\r\nAspect of terror (1 rank +10lvls) -> 3ranks (+12lvls)\r\nrank1 -> +4lvls\r\nrank2 -> +4lvls(total+8)\r\nrank3 -> +4lvls(total+12)\r\n\r\n\r\nrage (1 rank +12lvls) -> 3ranks (+12lvls)\r\nrank1 -> +4lvls\r\nrank2 -> +4lvls(total+8)\r\nrank3 -> +4lvls(total+12)\r\n\r\nWhy did i change Rage? Because otherwise it would be a +32lvls(or +41 with animage/ +44 lvls with kindred mage both at lvl3) for only 7 relevant perks (+ 1 rank of each in aspect of terror and hypnotic gaze)\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n - Extract .esp file to your Skyrim/Data folder\r\n - You need to activate the mod in either the Nexus Mod Manager or by checking the .esp in the skyrim launcher\r\n\r\nIncompatibilities\r\n - Other illusion perks changing mods (pretty obvious i think)\r\n\r\nLog: \r\n - Version 1.1 Fixed Aspect of Terror only works for Illusion spells, no longer should Increase the damage of Destruction Fire spells them character also have the Intense Flames perk. Thanks to fantom3592 for pointing it out.\r\n\r\nBugs:\r\n - None so far \r\n (please let me know of any bug)\r\n\r\nThis was my 1st mod, please comment and help me improve :P",
