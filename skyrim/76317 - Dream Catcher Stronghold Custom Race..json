  "descriptionHtml": "Dream Catcher Stronghold and Custom Race\r<br />[size=5]                  [/size][u]FamilyFriendly\r<br />[/u]Requirments:\r<br />Skyrim Only: ForAbandoned Stronghold, and NPC Quest.\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim and Hearthfire: Hearth fire NPC Quest.\r<br />\r<br />Recommendations:\r<br />Hearth fireMultiple Adoptions: by Tmphoenix\r<br />My Home is yourhome: by Volek\r<br />Any follower mod like UFO or AFT. (Tested w/ AFT) \r<br />\r<br />3 Lodges:Sabrescar Lodge:         \r<br /> 4 beds for followers/ Guards         \r<br /> Chests for gear and interactionmarkers for NPCs.\r<br />\r<br />Mammoth TuskLodge:          \r<br />3 NPCs, 2 of them Merchants. Custom AIPackages          \r<br />Alchemist and Blacksmith.          \r<br />Containers for the player to storeingredients and potions.         \r<br /> Chests and Interaction markers forNPCs.\r<br />\r<br />Dragon Eye Lodge:(Player Home)         \r<br /> 7 shield racks (look at wall baskets)          \r<br />8 Weapon Plaques          \r<br />7 Display Cases (6 Walled)          \r<br />4 Dagger wall display cases         \r<br /> 5 Mannequins (7 in abandoned file) NoGlitches&#33;&#33;          \r<br />4 Kids beds for Hearth fire file.         \r<br /> Treasure chests, gear chests, nicesoft master bed.         \r<br /> Interactive Fireplace. Uses RNDcampfire script, with firewood. \r<br />\r<br />This is astronghold behind Anises Cabin in Riverwood. Great view of the Lake, and\r<br />Navmeshed. \r<br />\r<br />The quest isoptional if you go in Anise’s Cellar and read the note the quest will start and\r<br />will tell you where to go. The Quest is a bit weird as you’ll see the third and\r<br />forth stage you might end up waiting for the NPCs to get to their locations.\r<br />Had it set but then went to change in a clean file and the whole quest wont\r<br />trigger, so this is the best I can do, one reason why it’s optional. The key is\r<br />In the Thalmor Justiciars Headquarters in case you don’t want to do the quest.\r<br />\r<br />Grey Heads: If yourgood with the CK, Id suggest open it up and CNTL F4 in the actors tab, my NPCs\r<br />will be at the top. If not download the Face gen optional file and put it in\r<br />your textures, face tint folder.\r<br />\r<br />CustomRace:This is based offthe ancient Germanic Tribe the Harii, I made a mod prior to this, called Sabre\r<br />scar Island, but wanted a more home base in Skyrim.The Meshes andTextures are the Vanilla, so even if you have a body mod, it won’t change this\r<br />race. I’d suggest you copy and paste your meshes and textures to the folders if\r<br />you want them to be less vanilla. Might have to do some photoshop work as well\r<br />for the war paint textures.\r<br />\r<br />War Paint??\r<br />\r<br />Benefits of thisrace, The Harii used to attack and sneak on their enemies at night, and douse\r<br />themselves in war paint to camouflage. Like Prometheus’ war paint in his Conan\r<br />mod, I came up with my own script and added it so your player will have a\r<br />custom paint job, face and body. ONLY WORKS FOR HARII RACE, but with any armor,\r<br />even custom. Custom weapons Arrows, Bow, and Axe. 6 Hairstyles I mixed and\r<br />matched from Apachii’s mod. They also have Night eye Power, since they attacked\r<br />at night, its better seeing in the dark. Must have eaten a lot of carrots&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />Also 10% damage resistant due to their tough native bodies.\r<br />\r<br />Specials:\r<br />3 strategic Guardtowers with weapon chests near them. \r<br />A fully Smithingset up outside, and alchemy station inside.\r<br />That’s a nicecatapult…be a shame if someone…oh wait.., check the pictures&#33;&#33;&#33; Can’t see the\r<br />necromancer, go across the lake to find a pressure plate just to the left of\r<br />the path for a ring side seat&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Two ways ofentering the stronghold, on foot in and out like normal through the gate.\r<br />Horse, use the pressure plates near the entrance, then go to the stable, and\r<br />hit the pull bars pending on which gate you came in, plus before getting on\r<br />your horse to leave hit the pull bar then hit the plate as you leave. If you\r<br />find open gates, that should be closed, or vise versa chances are a fox or\r<br />rabbit hit the plate.\r<br />\r<br />BUGS:I hate it but the quest is probably the biggest, as the NPCs will take a while to get to their\r<br />locations, just be patient and use your imagination a bit and try to dwell in\r<br />other areas to give them time to catch up. If your immersive shouldn’t give you\r<br />too much as you’ll want to try and dwell in other areas.\r<br />\r<br />Adoption, just maytake a bit for them to get their but that’s not a glitch, just the game.\r<br />\r<br />The interactivecamp fires, can’t use while standing. Not a glitch you need to sneak and insert\r<br />the fire wood just like Realistic needs and diseases mod, by Perseid9. It’s his\r<br />script. There is a glitch with the torches, as I made it so they don’t respawn\r<br />but they do.\r<br />\r<br />SpecialThank:\r<br />Stroti for his RusticFurniture Resource Mod.\r<br />Apachii for herwonderful Hair Styles.\r<br />Perseid9 for hisRealistic Needs and Diseases Mod.\r<br />TMPhoenix for hishelp, and awesome Multiple adoption Mod.\r<br />Prometheus, thoughnothing of his was used, I liked the War paint idea and utilized my own script.",
