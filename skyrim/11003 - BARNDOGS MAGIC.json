  "descriptionHtml": "*WARNING*\r\nTHIS MOD IS DESIGNED FOR HARDCORE GAMING- FOR THOSE THAT PLAY WITH MODS THAT INCREASE ENEMIES AND DIFFICULTY.\r\n\r\nWhen I\\'m a top level mage I want my abilities to reflect this, I want to wield the elements!! You hear of some pretty powerful mages in all the lore \r\nso I dont belive you can be over-powered in magic, but we are looking for a balance here.\r\n\r\nTo reward you for your studies in the schools of Magic you will now find your perks to give you greater boosts to allow you to reach your full \r\npotential as a Master of the Schools of Magic!\r\n\r\nThere are changes made to most of the schools of magic as listed below.\r\n\r\nLATEST UPDATE V1.0 COMPLETE BETA!\r\n\r\nILLUSION CHANGES\r\nAll I changed for illusion was:\r\n\r\nMaster/Expert/Adept/Apprentice/Novice Illusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nENCHANTING CHANGES\r\n\r\nExtra effect perk now allows you to put three enchantments on an item compared to the vanilla two.\r\n\r\nBut if you have mastered every school of magic you can put four effects onto an item!\r\n\r\nCONJURATION CHANGES\r\nI found it to be pretty well balanced already but of course there s a few tweaks\r\n\r\nMaster/Novice/Adept/Apprentice Conjuration:\r\nall reduce magicka costs in conjuration by a third.\r\n\r\nSummoner:\r\nTripled summoning distance whereas vanilla only doubled\r\n\r\nAtromancy:\r\nTripled Atronach summoned duration\r\n\r\nNecromancy:\r\nIncreased the duration of undead\r\n\r\nDark Souls:\r\nDoubled the vanilla boost to undead health points.\r\n\r\nTwin Souls:\r\nYou should now be able to summon four atronachs or four undead at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESTORATION CHANGES\r\n\r\nPerks Novice Restoration throgh to Master restoration reduce restoration spells by a third instead of a half.\r\n\r\nRegeneration:\r\nVanillla healing spells 50% more effective.\r\nBarndog\\'s are 100% more.\r\n\r\nRecovery:\r\nDoubled the vanilla multiplier to magicka regneration.\r\n\r\nAvoid Death:\r\nVanilla heals you 250 points when below 10% health\r\nBarndogs heals you 500 points.\r\n\r\nNecromage:\r\nSpell effects against undead our doubled.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUAL CASTING DOUBLE DAMAGE.\r\nAs long as you have the spells perk e.g. PERK Master Alteration for a master level spell, you\\'ll get dual-casting double damage in all magic classes.\r\n\r\nALTERATION CHANGES\r\n\r\nSame Improvements to master, expert, adept, apprentice & novice level spell perks as destruction.\r\n\r\nMage Armor:\r\nProtection spells like Stoneflesh are twice as strong if not wearing armor. (3 ranks) This seems the same as vanilla but in fact the base effects are almost twice as powerful as are these perks.\r\n\r\nMagic Resistance:\r\nLevel 1 Vanilla: 20%\r\nBarndogs: 35%\r\n\r\nLevel 2 Vanilla: 35%\r\nBarndogs: 50%\r\n\r\nLevel 3 Vanilla: 50%\r\nBarndogs: 75%\r\n\r\nStability:\r\nNow makes alteration effects last even longer\r\n\r\nAtronach:\r\nVanilla absorbs 30% magicka from spells cast at you, barndogs you absorb 75% - will tweak what spells actuall effect you here as it would be hard to absorb magicka under the torrent of some destruction spells.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION CHANGES\r\n\r\nNovice Destruction\r\n30% cost for novice destruction spells.\r\n25% more power for novice destruction spells.\r\n\r\nApprentice Destruction\r\n30% cost for apprentice destruction spells.\r\n30% more power for novice and apprentice destruction.\r\n\r\nAdept Destruction\r\n30% cost for adept destruction spells.\r\n35% more power for novice, apprentice and adept destruction spells.\r\n\r\nExpert Destruction\r\n30% cost for expert destruction spells.\r\n66% more power for novice,apprentice, adept and expert destruction spells.\r\n\r\nMaster Destruction\r\n25% cost for master destruction spells.\r\n100% more power for all destruction spells!\r\n\r\nNote the increases in the previous levels power are not stacked here.\r\n\r\nAugmented Flames/Frost/Shock Have been increased:\r\n\r\nFirst Level Vanilla: 25% increases\r\nFirst Leved Barndog: 50% increases\r\n\r\nSecond Level Vanila: 50% increases\r\nSecond Level Barndog: 75% increases\r\n\r\nHave Slighlty increased damage from dual casting and slightly increased chances of paralysis, fear and disintegration from the deep freeze, disintegration and intense flames perks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod is just the beginning of my complete magic overhaul so stay tuned and check out my tweaked Skull of Corruption if you need a cool mage accessory. \r\n\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=7697\r\n\r\nPlease feedback is appreciated.\r\nAnd if you want any of this packed by itself just let me know\r\nHope you enjoy.",
