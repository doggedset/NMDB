  "descriptionHtml": "[b]JaySuS Swords - Improved Loading Screens[/b] by Sparrow\r\n\r\nSome of the grammar and wording in the loading screens added by JaySuS swords felt a little... lackluster. This small mod rewords almost all of them to flow better, and also fixes a bug where quitting to the main menu would cause the models from these loadscreens to appear in place of the Skyrim logo. The \\\"JaySuS Swords\\\" mark before each loadscreen\\'s text remains, though it\\'s not that hard to remove if anyone wants me to.\r\n\r\nRequires the latest update of JaySuS Swords, and should probably be loaded before any other weapon mods. Simply drop the .esp into your Data file and select it in your load order.\r\n\r\nI am not affiliated with the original mod in any way; this is just something I made in ten minutes that I decided to release in case anyone else wanted it.",
