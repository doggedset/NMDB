  "descriptionHtml": "Okay so this was made simply out of necessity for me. I had USLEEP which doesnt come with the main USP (Unofficial Skyrim Patch) ESP. It shouldn&#39;t lol it is the newer better one. But anyways, some mods REQUIRE the main ESP for USP, and skyproc sees this and refuses to patch if you dont have the ESP enabled. but if you have USLEEP, you won&#39;t have it. Its incompatible and USP overwrites files that USLEEP improves on. So I made this simply empty ESP that you can enable for patching only. doesnt change the game in any way shape or form. You will of course need to disable after the patch but it bypasses the need for USPs main ESP when patching, and doesnt break your game to disable it after the patch.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]\r<br />TL;DR - Only use if you ALREADY HAVE USLEEP and only need the USP (Unofficial Skyrim Patch) Master for Skyproc&#33;&#33;&#33; Because USLEEP doesn&#39;t have it&#33;[/size]",
