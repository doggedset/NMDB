So I&#39;ll give it a shot.~&#34;\r<br />\r<br />This mod here made by me is what I have done to make all playable races and their children have more believable carrying weight abilities and I made this MAXIMUMLY COMPATIBLE WITH ALMOST EVERY THING UNLIKE THE OTHER MOD THAT TRIES TO DO THIS.~\r<br />\r<br />I made this mod completely on my own from just the default Skyrim game.~[/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00FFFF][size=10]Recommendations:[/size][/color] [size=4]I recommend using this mod [color=#00FFFF]WITH MichaelDusk&#39;s and mine&#39;s other mod called Werewolves Unleashed[/color]  if you like playing as a Werewolf and you want your STARTING Carrying Capacity to be some thing more realistic, place More Believable Carrying Weight AFTER [color=#00FFFF]Werewolves Unleashed[/color] in your mod order list.~[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48956/?][color=#00FFFF][size=5]Werewolves Unleashed[/size][/color][/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#FFFF00]I also recommend using my other mod Athletic Jump WITH[/color][/size] [size=5]More Believable Carrying Weight[/size][color=#FFFF00][size=4],[/size] [size=5]Athletic Jump[/size] [size=4]is a mod that changes the default ability to jump, jump distance, and fall damage height to be more &#39;athletic&#39; some what more of a &#39;gymnast&#39; athlete, perfect for trained stealthy agile characters, but still be realistic.~[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49167/?][color=#FFFF00][size=5]Atheltic Jump[/size][/color][/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Also you can try my other mod called &#34;Realistic Items&#39; Weights and Values&#34;: a VERY simple mod that increases the weight and the value of many misc items in the game.~[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49312/?][color=#00FF00][size=5][u]Realistic Items[/u][/size][/color][/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=#00FF00]ALL MODS ARE COMPATIBLE AND WORK WELL TOGETHER&#33;~[/color]\r<br />\r<br />If you want to use all of my (and MichaelDusk&#39;s) mods together, then place them in this order: \r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFFF00]Athletic Jump or Supernatural Jump[/color]\r<br />[color=#00FFFF]Werewolves Unleashed[/color]\r<br />[color=#00FF00]Realistic Items&#39; Weights and Values[/color]\r<br />More Believable Carrying Weight[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00FFFF][size=10]Pictures:[/size][/color] [size=4]In-game screenshots were taken by myself and edited to show the base carry weight changes of each race, character creation screen and starting background location shown in screenshots is a combination of:[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?][color=#FFFFFF][size=5]RaceMenu[/size][/color][/url]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]and[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9557/?][color=#00FFFF][size=5]Alternate Start - Live Another Life[/size][/color][/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00FF00][size=10]Comments:[/size] [size=4]PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THIS WORKS FOR YOU, ANY AND ALL FEEDBACK IS VERY HELPFUL FOR EVERY ONE&#33;~[/size][/color]",
