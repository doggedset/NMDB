He is my current playthrough as dragonborn but as I liked the way he looked, I decided to binge on learning out to make a follower during the night and finished him today. There are three versions of him, each with different hairstyles. The first is a vanilla hair style so you&#39;ll only need Skyrim and it&#39;s latest update. The second is froma  mod called KS Hairdo&#39;s, so you&#39;ll need that if you choose to use that version of Zayn. I don&#39;t think i&#39;m allowed to link to KS Hairdo&#39;s since it&#39;s off-site but a quick google search will help you find it no problem. The third version uses a hairstyle from Apachii Sky hair. \r<br />\r<br />Zayn can be found at the bee and barb inn in Riften. He wears predominantly light armor and wields 2-handed weapons such as greatswords, great axes, great scott, etc.\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=6][u]RECOMMENDED MODS\r<br />[/u][/size][size=3]Of course, you won&#39;t get the full effect without some cool extras. so here are some mods I use with him.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Northborn Scars: The scars on Zayn&#39;s face comes from this. He SHOULD (though I could be wrong, again, new to this) work without it but I recommend it all the same. Can be found here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49279/?\r<br />\r<br />Bandana&#39;s Of Skyrim: His bandana comes from this mod. Specifically he uses a red bandana. Highly recommend, since it just looks friggin awesome.\r<br />Can be found here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/20900/?\r<br />\r<br />Pierced Ears - Earrings: the piercings on his left ear comes from this mod. Not necessary as it effects nothing but his look, but I like it.\r<br />Can be found here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60901/?\r<br />\r<br />Any Kind of friggin sweet armor: It doesn&#39;t matter what armor you choose to give him, as long as it is friggin sweet. not kind of sweet, or sort of sweet, it MUST be friggin sweet. I suggest the mercenary armor from immersive armors, found here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19733/?\r<br />\r<br />Any kind of ballin awesome sword: Again, it doesn&#39;t matter what sword you give him (though he&#39;s far better with 2 handed swords), as long as it is ballin.\r<br />I personally recommend the Champion&#39;s Greatsword from Omegared99&#39;s Armor compilation, found here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10277/?[/center]\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />Stud84 - Your follower mod Mason is actually what gave me the kick in the ass to learn this, so thank ya&#33;",
