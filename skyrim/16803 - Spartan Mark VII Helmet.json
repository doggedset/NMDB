  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://img338.imageshack.us/img338/4058/desc22.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[b][color=\\\"#FFFFF\\\"]\\\"The Spartan helmet or \\'Mjolnir\\' is the helmet worn by elite Space Marines of the UNSC as part of the full outfit handed to special operatives in the SPARTAN programs. There are many variants of the Spartan Battle Armour, the last widely known one to be the Mark VI, of which was made as famous as the Mark V for being worn by the illustrious \\\"Master Chief\\\". There was, however, one more above that. The Mark VII. Only one prototype was ever made of which was lost during a conflict with a fleet of post-war Covenant Loyalists. Some people say it might have been an issue with a wormhole, or a Slip-Space jump. And since there was no live record of the encounter, there is no solid evidence as to what hapened. Only that it was lost.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s one of the few items still missing from the ships Armoury. No-one knows what happened to it.... except the lucky soul who happened to have found the Helmet... in the land of Skyrim.\\\"[/color][/b]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are multiple alternatives with different resistances. So they should suit whatever problems may arise along your path to becoming the true Dragonborn.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Installation:[/b]\r\n\r\nCopy all files/folders to /Data in your Skyrim folder.\r\n\r\nTo use in-game, just type \\\"help mjolnir 0\\\" into the console and use the corresponding code with player.additem \\\"item code\\\" \\\"quantity\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Bugs:[/b]\r\n\r\nStill no world collision model, as every attempt keeps crashing the game. So don\\'t attempt to drop the helmet on the floor or you [b]WILL[/b] lose it. If you don\\'t need it, store it in a chest or something at your home.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Note:[/b]\r\n\r\nI did NOT create this. This was from the abandoned Spartan Project mod for Oblivion. I only converted it to Skyrim.",
