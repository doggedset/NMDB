  "summary": "Changes values on Cultist gloves and helmet to make them make sense.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I found the Cultist item set to be very oddly done. The helmet is Heavy armor for some odd reason, and the gloves light armor. The robes and boots are actually clothing though. So what this mod does is correct them by making the armor on the gloves and helmet 0, and sets them to be the correct armor type; clothing.\r\n\r\nThe set still does not have any enchantments, minus the Magicka regen boost provided by the robes.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\n1. Download .esp (NMM recommended)\r\n2. Add to data folder (or add with NMM)\r\n3. If using ReProccer, run it.",
