      "changelogHtml": " Ver Ap11.2014\r<br />\r<br />----*New* Aspect of Soul : A hazardous new spell with 3 new abilities Note that this spell has a lot of AoE i mean a lot and rather OP\r<br />+Soul Strike(30%): Depend on the target Hp (75%/50%/25%) you strike them with (25/50/75) damage. In return, if your health drop below (75%/50%/25%) you&#39;ll get Fortify health (100/150/200)\r<br />+Soul Reap(25%): Similar to Living Bomb, target(s) is afflicted with dark magic and explode after 7 sec\r<br />+Soul Rending(Randomize): A massive soul pillar smite your foe for 60 points plus 10 points for 10 sec\r<br />+ On killing target(s): You&#39;ll capture their souls and enslaves them into an enslaved soul and fight for you, up to 15\r<br />+Enslaved Souls shares the same AoS as you\r<br />----Aspect of Rune: Now you&#39;ll hit with newUnstable Reaction for 50%\r<br />+Unstable Reaction is a fusion of Chain Reaction(multi explosion) and Living Bomb.

After scanning my mod with TES5EDIT, i saw i edited/altered FrostSlowFFContact (a vanilla magic effect) and unticked RECOVER. Therefore, it mess everything that has frost hazard to permaslow.\r<br />\r<br />TL;DR : PERMAFROST IS FIXED...Hopefully\r<br />\r<br />PERIODICALLY DESTRUCTION SKILL GAIN: This is due to a stray script. Now that i found and remove it. The issue is now fixed\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Ver Feb25.2014 \r<br />\r<br />=All Aspect: Not really new. Was implemented in the last version but i forgot to mention. Each aspect have the ability of damage progression. Meaning the more you hit, the more they suffer. This is because each aspect have a base Mark for Death on them. \r<br />=*new*Aspect of Rune: A melee spell based on runic weapons and rune bombs. (Note: This spell is like a double edge sword use it wisely (ie Living Bomb) \r<br />---Living Bomb: 40% chance to stun and stick a runic bomb on them for 10 seconds. Bomb will only explode if the target(s) regain conscious. \r<br />Living Bomb can kill you. Its highly recommended to get way from the target(s). Even if its exploded while the target(s) is dead, wait 3 seconds before approaching them. \r<br />---Chain Reaction: 20% to lend multiple mini rune bombs that explode right away. \r<br />---Weapon Call: 5% to call various Runic weapons \r<br />---Mighty Weapon Call: 3% to call 2 type of Runic weapons (Mighty Explosive Bow and Explosive Dagger).

Mod is fully clean through TES5edit and clearer description... i hope \r<br />There&#39;ll be no more optionals for no summon nor less op or op versions. Deal with what i have to offer to you. Because it is quite PITA to do multiple versions. If you found it OP then it might not suit you, im sorry =/ \r<br />-If you use Skyre, spend your point in Light Weaponery [Sword (use Sword keyword)and Unarmed], Destruction and Conjuration \r<br />-Aspect of Death has been reworked a bit: Now raise corpse on dead bodies, up to 15 undeads and work as normal spell on living mob \r<br />-Aspect of Earth has been reworked a bit: Now you have 50% chance to turn ethereal. Enemy cannot damage you but you can except it will cancel ethereal in the other hand \r<br />-Aspect of Ice: Now cast a ward spell that reflect spell projectiles. [color=red] Require: Reflection Ward or it will not work. Aspect of ice guardian is now a frost atronach accompanied with 2 ice wraiths\r<br />-Farengar is still the placeholder for the spells. I&#39;ll add, in future, a craftable section with some &#34;hard-to-acquire&#34; materials needed. So it will be more rewarding to get the spells tha way. \r<br />-There&#39;s a ton of scripts, i might miss to upload some of them not sure. Report to me if you found some effects not working. \r<br />-Many small tweak and additions....   <br/> \n",
