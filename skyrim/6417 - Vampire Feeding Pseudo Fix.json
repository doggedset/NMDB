  "summary": "For those who cannot feed as a vampire.",
  "descriptionHtml": "For some people, feeding is broken, which means they are stuck at stage 4. Until there is a proper fix, you can use these batch files instead. \r\n\r\nUsing this, you won\\'t be a vampire as far as the game is concerned (no feeding, no automatic starving each day, npcs will not attack you at stage 4), but at least you can have all vampire effects, and can manually progress through the stages.\r\n\r\nTo execute a batch file, type \\\"bat <name>\\\" in the console.\r\n\r\nFIRST execute vamp0.\r\nIt cures you from vampirism. You can use this anytime.\r\n\r\nTHEN execute one of vamp1 to vamp4 to get to the desired stage.\r\n\r\nYes, it\\'s not much. I\\'m sorry, but this isn\\'t my fault ;)",
