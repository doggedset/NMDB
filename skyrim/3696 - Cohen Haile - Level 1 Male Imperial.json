  "descriptionHtml": "A SaveFile of my character, Cohen Haile, for all of us who are secure enough to play a male character. He is an Imperial and, as an Imperial, I sided with Hadvar, the Imperial Soldier whilst escaping Helgen. The SaveFile is located directly after exiting the cavern which you used to escape the Dragon, the character has not yet visited Whiterun, and I believe he is still Level 1, at the most he is Level 2. I simply thought others would enjoy a decent yet normal looking male character to play as. \r\n\r\nNote: To ensure that the character you play as looks EXACTLY like the one in the screenshot, you must first download two files (though they are far from necessary, just the hair color will look a like different [and I mean very little] and the scar will look different);\r\n\r\nTelthalions Finer Hair\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2207\r\n\r\nXCE - Xenius Character Enhancement\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2356\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER - The two aforementioned mods are the property of their respective authors and I have in no way contributed with their construction, I am simply pointing you in the direction required if you wish to achieve the same look as the character in the screenshot.\r\n\r\nP.S. To install the file simply locate your SaveFile directory (it\\'s usually C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\UserName\\\\My Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Saves)\r\n\r\nIf the \\'Saves\\' file does not exist in your Skyrim directory, create it and drop the SaveFile inside it. Then you\\'re good to go, open Skyrim and load the save!",
