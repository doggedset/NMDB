Fortunately the King had enough clarity and foresight to see this was perhaps the best strategy incase of any invasion.\r\n\r\nThe alterations to the already standing law are as follows;\r\n\r\nWhilst any militia may be formed in the defence of Skyrim and the towns within, no militia captain can override the rule of the local Jarl or try to usurp him or her.\r\n\r\nThe Venator Daemonous Militia may take up residence in any town, city or camp site as an added bulk to the already residing armed forces but cannot take control of the local armed forces unless given permission from the residing Jarl, or in his or her\\\\\\'s absence. The Thane of the local town or City.\r\n\r\n[b]Credits[/b]\r\n\r\nThe creator of the Lore Friendly Armour Pack â€“ he let his mod become public modable as he no longer supports that mod and has let anyone use it for their own.\r\n\r\nHothtrooper44 for his awesome armours\r\n\r\n[b]Permissions[/b]\r\n\r\nIf you wish to alter, improve, integrate into another mod or anything that may need permission, you will need to ask for my approval and ask hothtrooper44 if you can further use his mods too.\r\n\r\nDO NOT UPLOAD THIS MOD TO ANY OTHER SITE!!\r\n\r\n[b]Install[/b]\r\n\r\nMAKE SURE YOU HAVE SKYRIM MONSTER MOD v12\r\n\r\nDownload with NMM, it will do the hard work for you.\r\n\r\nor if you have issues with NMM due to the file size...\r\n\r\nDownload manually, extract files to your Skyrim/Data directory\r\n\r\n[b]Uninstall[/b]\r\n\r\nuse NMM or that does work just delete the files install in the Data directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDhegonus[/center]",
