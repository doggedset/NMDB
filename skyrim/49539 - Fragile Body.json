I just wanted to share it with the community, and simplify the job for people who just want the body. \r<br />\r<br />The pictures are in weigh 0 and 100\r<br />\r<br />Also recommend to use it with ECE and Univision Face for UNP\r<br />Here are the links to them.\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12951/?\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14569/?\r<br />\r<br />Natilde gave his permission to everyone to mess with his mods, since he is not working on skyrim modding anymore. I am also aware natilde made that body based on others, so if you are the owner of one of these mods, PLEASE contact me, and i will put your name into the credits, or delete it if that&#39;s the case.",
