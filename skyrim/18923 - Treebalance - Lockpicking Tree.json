  "descriptionHtml": "[font=verdana][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30502]Spanish translation by incata available now.[/url]\r<br />\r<br />The Lockpicking tree was formatted in a way that necessitated wasting perks all over to get to anything good. I&#39;ve changed this. Now, you can spend a few points to get some benefit, or spend a bunch if you need them for the same power.\r<br />Also available on the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=77263149]Steam Workshop[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[list][*]The lock mastery perks were collapsed into a single perk that&#39;s just called Lock Mastery. Each rank makes all locks 40% easier to pick. Their skill requirement progression was also changed to 0/20/40/60/80.\r<br />[*]Other requirements were also dropped. Quick Hands fell to 20, Wax Key to 30, Golden Touch to 40, Treasure Hunter to 60, and Locksmith to 70.\r<br />[/list][/font]",
