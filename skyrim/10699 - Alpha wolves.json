  "summary": "Same as my other mod, the only difference is that the wolves are now much weaker, this is due to a lot of requests.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is the exact same as the one on Steam workshop, had to add it here since I keep getting error 9 when I try to upload it, the only difference with this mod to the other one on workshop is that by request the Alpha wolves are much weaker.\r\n\r\nThis mod brings Alpha wolves into the world, the ones that we saw at E3, it also adds more wolves into the wild and gives the overall sense that they\\'re all in a pack. Other than adding more wolves into the world, the standard wolves have not been altered in anyway. The AI of the wolves have also been altered to make them more realistic, they won\\'t always attack you sometimes they will warn you off, much like the bears, this goes for the standard wolves as well.",
