  "descriptionHtml": "Hammerfell Outfit V_1 by jase180\r\n\r\nA very simple retex of the Hammerfell outfit. I didn\\'t like \r\n\r\nthe color of the original so I did a quick edit to change \r\n\r\nthem to a darker look, but still keeping a worn out well traveled look. I \r\n\r\nwanted this to feel the same, just darker and not so Aladdin \r\n\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nIf somebody does a better job that would be great! I\\'d like \r\n\r\nto make a version where the lower half of the face is covered \r\n\r\nwith the scarf, but not sure how to make that work yet.\r\n\r\nFeel free to endorse it if you like it! That would be swell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n - Installation Instructions - \r\nExtract the \\'textures\\' folder from the archive using WinRAR \r\n\r\nor 7Zip, and place it in your Skyrim\\\\Data folder. Overwrite \r\n\r\nif asked. \r\n\r\nUse as you want, just credit me :)\r\n",
