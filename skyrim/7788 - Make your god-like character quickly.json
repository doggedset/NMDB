  "descriptionHtml": "/!\\\\ It doesn\\'t include Breton Race ! They have a better build because of the resist magicka ! \r\nI will make another file for them !!! .\r\n\r\nOkay first of all my english is very bad so i hope i will be understandable .\r\n\r\nBefore you read it for all people that will say : \\\"They are no best build blablabla\\\" , \\\"skyrim isn\\'t a game for Challenge blablabla\\\" You have nothing to do here .\r\n\r\nThis is a .txt file that you can use with the bat command ingame .\r\n\r\nIt make your character lvl 81 with 900 life , 100 Stamina , 100 Magicka .\r\nAnd What i judge to be the best 80 Perks in the game for all the race ( No Breton that have 2 different perks ) . This is for Player that want to play With mod that increase difficulty .\r\nYou Can make your own change of course with codes it\\'s a nice Base for make a very good character quickly even if you don\\'t like my build .\r\n\r\nI won\\'t explain why i choose those perks , if you have a bit of experience you will understand why . The best way for maximal dmg output is dual wielding ( because dual furry are completely overpowered ) . And Destruction is here for Dragon/hard fight With impact for tempo and for long distance fight .\r\n\r\nYou will have to get the stuff yourself  i will make another file later for that but it take long . \r\n\r\nFor make the best stuff possible check this vid√©o: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7uYTZmdUi0&feature=related\r\n\r\nFor the enchant you will need the max dmg on weapons and resist magicka and reduce cost of destruction , depending of which stone you wanna use ( Atronach or Lord ) .\r\nremember that Resist magicka is capped to 85% and armor to 567 ( 80% Dmg reduce ) .\r\n\r\nFor me it\\'s like this : ( i use dual helm with tiara + Falmer helmet and a mod for hide it because it looks bad  ) .\r\nI use The Lord Stone and i have done the quest of the lover in the temple of mara in riften so i have 70 Basic Resist magicka .\r\nDestruction spell cost 0 .\r\n\r\nTiara : -29% Destruction Cost +74 magicka\r\nFalmer Helmet : -29 % Destruction cost + 74 magicka .\r\nRing : +48 % One handed + -29% Destruction cost\r\nAmulet : +48 % One handed + 74 Health .\r\nArmor : -29 % Destruction Cost + 74 Health .\r\nGauntlet : +48 % One handed + 74 Magicka .\r\nBoots : +48 % One handed + 74 Stamina .\r\nShield : +29% Magicka resist ( for hit cap with shield against dragon ) + 74 health .\r\n\r\nI will add a lot of different Build later . But all the other Viable are for Breton ...\r\n\r\n\r\n",
