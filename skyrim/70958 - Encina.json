  "descriptionHtml": "[b]This file is a racemenu preset for the female nord based on the likeness of a renown and sexy model named Encina Severa.[/b]\r<br /> \r<br />[b]There are two files, the first one (EncinaSevera.jslot) which is the racemenu preset, and the 2nd file (femalebrow_01.dds) is a set of custom eyebrows that I created specifically for this mod. One of the femalebrow_## files in the following directory computer/local disk/programfilesx86/steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/data/textures/actors/character/femalebrows must be overwritten. Read and follow the below instructions very carefully.[/b]\r<br /> \r<br />[color=#00ff00]===INSTALLATION===\r<br />[b]Step 1. After downloading this file, go into the directory [i]my computer/local disk/program files x86/steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/data/skse/plugins/chargen/presets[/i] and drag and drop the file EncinaSevera.jslot into there. [/b][color=#ffff00]NOTE: before the &#34;chargen&#34; directory is created, you have to save a preset in racemenu, so just go into the racemenu screen and then go into presets, then press F5 to save any preset and create the directory.[/color]\r<br /> \r<br />[b]Step 2. Boot the game up, go into racemenu by typing &#34;showracemenu&#34; in the console, then click &#34;presets&#34; on the bar in the top right of the screen, and press F9 to load presets and load &#34;EncinaSevera.jslot&#34; (it should be in there) and voila, there you are&#33;[/b]\r<br /> \r<br />[b]Step 3. To install her eyebrows, go into the following directory[/b] [b]computer/local disk/programfilesx86/steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/data/textures/actors/character/femalebrows and drag the femalebrow_01.dds file contained in the download into the open directory screen for skyrim&#39;s female eyebrow textures, drag and drop the file contained in this download into the Skyrim femalebrows folder click &#34;move and replace&#34; to replace the existing texture.
