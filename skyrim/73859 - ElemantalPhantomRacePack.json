  "descriptionHtml": "Play as a ghost in one of 4 types\r<br />Elemental (fire, frost or shock)\r<br />normal phantom style summonner\r<br />\r<br />this works with most mods as well as vanilla \r<br />\r<br />each of these races have a skill set applicable to them but they are all similar.\r<br />\r<br />Fire ghost has +100 fire resistance but +100 to frost weakness, a cheap to cast firebolt and a cheap to cast flame thrall.\r<br />Frost ghost has +100 frost resistance but +100 to fire weakness, a cheap to cast ice spike and a cheap to cast frost thrall.\r<br />Shock ghost has +100 to shock resistance but +100 magic weakness, a cheap to cast thunderbolt and a cheap to cast storm thrall.\r<br />Phantom  summoner has +100 magic resistance but +100 shock weakness, a cheap to cast dead thrall and the ritual stone spell as a racial \r<br />power.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: the effects are visual only and are not cloaks this is to aid sneaking also they are applied AFTER the character select so you can see\r<br /> what your creating.\r<br />\r<br />IMPORTANT: the Vampire versions of these races are in the mod but i cant seem to link to the main character files so any advice on how to link these so you dont need to change races for the vampire quests (they dont see you as a vampire lord your still mortal)\r<br />\r<br />picture order above Fire, Frost Shock, Shock effect1, Shock effect2, Phantom note shock effect are not constant just randomly flash up but \r<br />they are there, \r<br />\r<br />they all work on my game any isuues drop us a line hope you guys like my first mod there are more to come :D",
