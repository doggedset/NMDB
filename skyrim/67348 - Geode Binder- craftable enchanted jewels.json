  "modName": "Geode Binder- craftable enchanted jewels",
  "summary": "know all those soul gem fragments you see around skyrim and have use for? want to add some magical properties to normal gems like rubies and emeralds? this mod lets you craft elemental scroll like spells from normal jewels, giving them some more uses in the game other than taking up pointless space.",
  "descriptionHtml": "update: after about a year I have returned to make cheap useless mods that no one downloads XD in this update i fixed some spelling mistakes here and there, made the descriptions match,  and added a glow effect to the shield wards: when you block with the emerald, you glow green, etc. also for balancing reasons, i changed the requirement for the shields: you only get the resistance or the boost when you block&#33;&#33; no more walking around with 75% fire resistance just cause you have the shield equipped. no, uh uh, you gotta block to gain the boosts now &gt;:D\r<br />[u][b]\r<br />version 3:[/b][/u] I modified the warding jewels so there are two variants: normal jewel and flawless: both require a filled grand soul gem to make, along with the jewel. they all give a ward when blocking and resistance to whatever element the jewel is based on. the flawless ones do that AND give 50 magicka boost with 25% magicka regen. you no longer need jewels in inventory to gain the resistance. \r<br />\r<br />simple mod: a new crafting station is added to hela&#39;s folly, the shipwreck where deekus is, called the Geode Binder\r<br />\r<br />6 new &#34;scrolls&#34; are added in the form of gems, each of which can be crafted from 3 soul gem fragments, a gem, and a filled soul gem.\r<br />\r<br />6 other versions are available from flawless gems, but require stronger filled soul gems.\r<br />\r<br />and finally, 6 other items are craftable from grand soul gems, and will only appear in the crafting menu if you have a grand filled soul gem, a gem, and a flawless version of that gem. they are ward type shields that create a ward when blocking with, and grant resistance to the element from which they are made. diamonds grant resistance to magic, for example, but only if you have a diamond or flawless diamond in your inventory.\r<br />\r<br />here&#39;s how it works:\r<br />rubies = fire gems, sapphires = frost, amethysts = shock, emeralds = poison (like how the emerald is used in the spider imbuing chamber to make a poison cloaked spider in dragonborn), garnets = drain life (vampire spell basically), and diamonds = pure magic (like meridia&#39;s light beams in her quest)\r<br />\r<br />because of the fact that there are 5 different types of soul gem fragments, I made 5 recipes for each gem, which will only appear if you have those fragments in your inventory, so the menu wont get cluttered up. \r<br />\r<br />why hela&#39;s folly? well in the db quest, someone wants deekus dead, but why? he&#39;s just a random guy who found a shipwreck. well 2 notes next to the binder should explain why someone wants him dead :)\r<br />\r<br />nothing is required, just put into data and enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />and if you have trouble finding soul gem fragments, I recommend this mod: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37606][b][size=3]Soul Gem Binding - Cra...[/size][/b][/url] which lets you destroy soul gems into fragments in order to make stronger soul gems. obviously, I am using it myself for my play through, with my own version of it to suit my playstyle (I added it along, but its not needed to play this mod. all credits go to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/6292794]MimiTheAlchemist[/url] for his mod)",
