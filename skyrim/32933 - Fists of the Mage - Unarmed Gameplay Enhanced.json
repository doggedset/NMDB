  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Verdana][size=5][b][color=blue]Description (Version 1.0)[/color][/b]\r\nThe power of Skyrim\\'s spells can now be applied to unarmed attacks. Enchant gauntlets and gloves with the power of the fists of the mage.\r\n\r\nThis mod includes three enchantments (Fire, Frost, and Lightning) that can be applied to all gauntlets and gloves. Pre-enchanted and dis-enchantable gloves can be found in Dragonsreach near Farengar - there is an added display case with the three gloves. The elemental damage scales with your destruction skill and relevant perks. These are all brawl-friendly, so feel free to use them in brawls as their use will not result in the brawl ending or a bounty.\r\n\r\n[b][color=blue]Description (Version 2.0)[/color][/b]\r\nThis version adds 8 new enchantments and pre-enchanted gloves. The following lists all 11 of the gloves to-date:\r\n- [b][color=red]Fire Fists of the Mage[/color][/b]: Unarmed attacks do fire damage to targets.\r\n- [b][color=red]Frost Fists of the Mage[/color][/b]: Unarmed attacks do frost damage to targets.\r\n- [b][color=red]Shock Fists of the Mage[/color][/b]: Unarmed attacks do shock damage to targets.\r\n- [b][color=red]Health Absorbing Fists of the Mage[/color][/b]: Unarmed attacks absorb health from targets.\r\n- [b][color=red]Magicka Absorbing Fists of the Mage[/color][/b]: Unarmed attacks absorb magicka from targets.\r\n- [b][color=red]Stamina Absorbing Fists of the Mage[/color][/b]: Unarmed attacks absorb stamina from targets.\r\n- [b][color=red]Paralyzing Fists of the Mage[/color][/b]: Unarmed attacks paralyze the target.\r\n- [b][color=red]Soul Trapping Fists of the Mage[/color][/b]: If the target dies within 5 seconds, fills a soul gem.\r\n- [b][color=red]Magicka Damaging Fists of the Mage[/color][/b]: Unarmed attacks damage the target\\'s magicka.\r\n- [b][color=red]Stamina Damaging Fists of the Mage[/color][/b]: Unarmed attacks damage the target\\'s stamina.\r\n- [b][color=red]Fists of Sheogorath[/color][/b]: Unarmed attacks unleash the wrath of Sheogorath!\r\n\r\nThe version also adds a new book item to Farengar\\'s desk in Whiterun, that hints to the location of these gloves. The Fire/Frost/Shock gloves retain their previous position as in the previous version. The uploaded screenshots display the location of the strongboxes throughout the game that contain the gloves. One issue to note is that, while 10 of the gloves are brawl-friendly, the Fists of Sheogorath are not due to something that I am unable to circumvent. Thus, it is recommended that those gloves not be equipped during brawls. As before, all of the pre-enchanted gloves can be disenchanted and their enchantment applied to other gauntlet/glove items.\r\n\r\n[b][color=blue]Description (Version 2.1)[/color][/b]\r\nThis version adds 1 new enchantment and pre-enchanted gloves:\r\n- [b][color=red]Chaos Fists of the Mage[/color][/b]: Unarmed attacks have a 50% chance for each element of fire, frost and shock to do damage to the target.\r\n\r\nThese gloves may be found alongside the Champion\\'s Cudgel, on the body of General Falx Carius.\r\n\r\n[b][color=blue]Description (Version 2.2)[/color][/b]\r\nThis version fixes the brawl issue with the Chaos enchantment. Enchantments now have values attached. Thus, enchanting items with this mod\\'s enchantments will increase the items\\' values. Also, enchanting and disenchanting will level Enchanting skill.\r\n\r\n[b][color=blue]Description (Version 2.3)[/color][/b]\r\nThis version adds 1 new enchantment and pre-enchanted gloves:\r\n- [b][color=red]Fists of Meridia[/color][/b]: Unarmed attacks do fire damage, and if killing undead, there is a chance to cause a fiery explosion that turns or destroys nearby undead.\r\n\r\nThese gloves may be found in a chest behind the pedestal of the Dawnbreaker, located in the Kilkreath Catacombs.\r\n\r\n[b][color=blue]Incompatibilities/Bugs[/color][/b]\r\n- As always, it is imperative you backup save file before installing any mod.\r\n- This mod edits the Player actor in the CK, so other mods that do the same will be incompatible, including my [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31693][i]Explosive Unarmed Punches[/i][/url] mod. Admittedly, this is a very small fraction of the mods out there, but some race mods (such as [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3678570][b]Nikitaa[/b][/url]\\'s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22903/][i]Succubus Race[/i][/url] and large overhauls will be incompatible.\r\n- If the player becomes a Vampire or Werewolf, the enchantments will cease to function and unarmed attacks will produce the normal results, as if the player is not wearing the enchanted gear. Luckily, it won\\'t break the game or cause crashes, however.\r\n[s]- Also, this mod edits the \\\"Brawl\\\" quest, so any mods that do the same, or fix \\\"Brawl-bugs\\\" are incompatible.[/s] [color=red][b]EDIT:[/b] I am mistaken. I just tested the compatibility, and it actually still functions, so it is technically compatible. The reason I said it was not compatible is because I made an assumption based on the above. While it is compatible as far as I can tell, some further testing might be required to determine to what extent the mods might still conflict.[/color]\r\n- It has been noted that, if using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5312/][i]Acquisitive Soul Gems[/i][/url], the Soul Trap enchantment will not trap the soul of a target. As I am aware, this is true for any Soul Trap magic effect added by most mods. Thank you to [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/4524635][b]Domkavosh[/b][/url] for this bug report, as well as for the idea of a Dawnbreaker enchantment.\r\n\r\n[b][color=blue]Installation[/color][/b]\r\nThe easiest way to install is through the NMM, but a manual install only requires that you extract the .rar file and merge the \\\"Data\\\" folder inside with the \\\"Data\\\" folder in your Skyrim install.\r\n\r\nAs always, don\\'t forget to comment on whether you liked the mod or not. And, remember to check out my other mods:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31809][b]Brelyna Maryon Redone[/b][/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31778][b]Dragon Aspect Ambient Sound Remover[/b][/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31693][b]Explosive Unarmed Punches[/b][/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28565][b]Ice Form Weapons[/b][/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33160][b]The Golden Touch - New Spells and Effect Shaders[/b][/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31744][b]The Hulk Follower[/b][/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28670][b]Weapon Enchantments Redone[/b][/url]\r\n[/size][/font]",
