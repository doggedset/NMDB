  "descriptionHtml": "[i]This is not an ESM or an ESP. This is t[b]wo[/b] PNG heightmap files. Some processing will be require to get this map into Skyrim.\r<br />[/i]\r<br />[b]Beta 6 release&#33;[/b] What happened to 4 and 5? Didn&#39;t like them so I kept tinkering. This will remain unchanged for a while (probably at least year, maybe?) - I&#39;m out of &#34;new&#34; source material from Elder Scrolls Online.\r<br />\r<br />A quick changelog:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Lots of tweaks for accuracy, mostly in Hew&#39;s Bain, Gold Coast, Valenwood, and Elsweyr. Can&#39;t give a total list because I don&#39;t quite remember everything I&#39;ve been poking at\r<br />[*]Tweaks to Cyrodiil because I can&#39;t seem to stop tweaking Cyrodiil.\r<br />[*]Suggested TESAnnwyn setting have been updated below.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />Scheduled changes for next Beta:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Increased accuracy for High Rock and Hammerfell\r<br />[*]Slightly new worldspace division:Â Bangkorai, Wrothgar, and Craglorn will be treated as if it would be one connected worldspace.\r<br />[*]Large Worldspace divisions will be detailed in the next release&#39;s README.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />Updates are happening as I play through Elder Scrolls Online, as that is the only source since Arena and Daggerfall for many locations. My overall accuracy aim is around 80%, which matches about what Betheda and Zenimax have between games. Currently, the map is sitting between about 70%, because interpreting height from ESO maps doesn&#39;t work well. Vvardenfel, Skyrim, and Cyrodiil are sitting closer to 80% to 90%.\r<br />\r<br />Several homages to popular mods have been incorporated into the map, as well as a few non-lore islands and quite a few lore islands (especially from Redguard). There are plenty of screenshots in the gallery to check out - this map has a ton of detail to it and looks great once imported into Skyrim&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]INCLUDED:[/b]\r<br />[list][*]One (1) PNG file of the direct export from GROME, resaved as an uncompressed file (apparently the compression was causing issues or something)\r<br />[*]One (1) PNG file pre-prepped for TESAnnwyn - all that is required is to properly crop the image and export it to a RAW format.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[b]REQUIREMENTS:[/b]\r<br />[list][*]7zip for decompressing the download file\r<br />[*]A way to modify the heightmap for importing into Skyrim or another game/program\r<br />[*]TESAnnwyn for importing into an Elder Scrolls game\r<br />[/list]\r<br />Sorry, but I am unable to assist with importing this into a game format. My knowledge on the process is extremely limited, but I have created a test worldspace. The following notes should help get you pointed in the right direction, though.\r<br />\r<br />[b]DESIGN NOTES:[/b]\r<br />[list=1][*]I know that proportions are a bit odd in places compared to official maps. The reason is two-fold:\r<br />[*]Trying to fit official Elder Scrolls Online maps with other official Bethesda Maps is kind of a pain. I like a lot of what TESO does, but their maps are the sketchiest part of the game&#39;s lore.\r<br />[*]This map was designed to be sub-divided into worldspaces because of the +/-64 bug that prevents having a properly functional playable environment. There is currently no way around it. Over at Beyond Skyrim, we had to cut up Morcroft&#39;s heightmap because of this bug.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[b]RESIZING SUGGESTIONS:[/b]\r<br />[list=1][*]Unlock or duplicate the Background layer in an image editing program like Photoshop\r<br />[*]Change the canvas size to a multiple of 8 for both dimensions (it doesn&#39;t have to be square)\r<br />[*]Move the free-floating layer so that the area you are wanting for your map is located within the bounds of the new canvas.\r<br />[*]Export as RAW.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[b]TESTING:[/b]\r<br />I created an 80 by 80 cell worldspace of (most of) Morrowind with these TESAnnwyn settings:\r<br />[quote]TESannwyn -i Skyrim -p 1 -b 16 -d 4096x4096 -s 0.4 -x -64 -y -64 -h -20800 -w Colovia TamBeta03prepped_c_Cl.raw[/quote]That placed the water level at 0. Some testing and adjustment will most likely be needed for your own map.\r<br />\r<br />[b]USAGE:[/b]\r<br />It may be used by any mod project. Or for Minecraft. Or whatever - it can be used for any [i][b]non-commercial[/b][/i] project in any engine. All I ask is credit in return. While it isn&#39;t required, if you do use this I would love to see the results&#33; Just fire off a PM or something, although I&#39;m usually only on Nexus about once a month.\r<br />\r<br />[b]NO WARRENTY, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. [/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b]NO TECHNICAL SUPPORT. [/b]Well, unless you ask really nicely and I know the answer. I am [i]not [/i]the most knowledgeable person on the subject of importing heightmaps, though.\r<br />\r<br />Heightmap was designed in GROME3",
