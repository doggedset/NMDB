  "descriptionHtml": "Nikandros - Means \\\"victory of a man\\\" from the Greek elements (nike) \\\"victory\\\" and (andros) \\\"of a man\\\".\r\n\r\nFound in Riften.\r\nWhen you first meet him he will be in rags and have mesh issues with his head. This is unfix-able at this time.\r\nSimply give him a amulet or ring and he will equip his Nightingale armor. Or use the \\\"You could dress better\\\" command in the \\\"You know...\\\" menu in UFO.\r\n\r\nHe wields a ebony dagger of paralyzing and carries a lot of mead, wine and ale along with more food. He levels with you.\r\nPerks include, Shadow Warrior (which he does use in battle), Silent, Lightfoot, Silent roll, and can use the shouts, disarm and elemental fury.\r\nHis class and battle style is assassin. \r\n\r\nMore mods by me\r\nDelaney of the Pure Heart: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17988\r\nDragkol Dragonpriest: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=18199",
