  "descriptionHtml": "Adds much more Vegetation to the closer Outskirts of Whiterun as well as to the surrounding tundra, but keeping the original style of Whiterun and the landscape itself. Whiterun and the nearby tundra looks much more detailed (as you would turn on max details on a slider at the game settings...). It shows, the town of whiterun must have a decent gardener... \r\n\r\nIt\\'s a WIP, where \r\n-Boreal Tundra Trees\r\n-Tundra Shrub\r\n-Flowers\r\n\r\nshow up at the moment. I am thinking about adding some more farm houses, more animals.\r\n\r\nHave Fun!\r\n",
