  "summary": "This adds a buyable home to Riverwood. It has enchanting and alchemy stations. It also adds a smelter near the blacksmith shop. Lush ivy covers the waterside wall and a beautiful waterfall can be seen to cascade behind it. It can be purchased from Gerdur of Riverwood.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is the King of Pointy Hat\\'s own personal home. It\\'s located on the shore opposite the lumber mill in Riverwood. It\\'s made to blend into the Riverwood enviroment with as little alteration as possilbe. The pier near the mill was extened to the opposite shore. The bank near the home was altered to have a gentle slope toward the water rather than a cliff. This area is made to blend with the wooded surroundings and waterfall nearby. A smelter was also added near the blacksmith in Riverwood. Some bushes were shifted to make this possible. \r\nAll containers are safe inside the home. They were duplicated and marked not to respawn. \r\n\r\nThe house is buyable for 2500 gold from Gerdur in Riverwood.\r\n\r\nWhat this plugin changes:\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\nA house is added to Riverwood.\r\nA smelter is added to riverwood near the blacksmith.\r\nThe house is buyable from Gerdur.\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\nJust copy the Data folder into your Skyrim main directory and merge it with your existing data folder.\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\nUninstallation:\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\nDelete the \\\"SteepledHat\\'s Riverwood Home\\\" from your data folder.
