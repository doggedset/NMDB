  "summary": "This is just a simple edit of MannyGTs RCRN Classic preset for Lanterns of Skyrim made to be used with ELE and ELEP ENB by Jawz.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[u][i][b]Update Nov 7 2014:[/b][/i][/u] This preset is no longer necessary to use with ELE as Jawz has released his new version \r<br />here at this link [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59733/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59733/?[/url]. This file is still good to use though if you use his old alpha version and get really red lanterns with Lanterns of Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod for any game in a very long time. I decided to make this after making the switch to [b]Enhanced Lighting for ENB[/b] and ELEP - Full Vanilla Customizable ENB by Jawz. When I started using this set up I noticed the lighting colour from MannyGTs lanterns were an awful red and with some very helpful information from Jawz I decided to fix this problem myself.\r<br />\r<br />All the credit for this mod goes to both Manny for the original Lanterns of Skyrim and preset and Jawz for his awesome lighting and ENB preset and even more awesome his helpful information on how to edit this using the CK. I had never touched the CK for anything before this and his instructions were amazing and got me going very easily.\r<br />\r<br />This is simply a modified version of MannyGTs RCRN Classic preset. I increased the radius from 512 to 600 and changed the colour to have a more orange tone to it.\r<br />\r<br />If anyone finds any problems with this please let me know and I will do my best to fix them. This is my first ever mod and I will be very surprised if this isn&#39;t messed up in some way even though its working for me.\r<br />\r<br />Links to mods this was designed around.\r<br />Required\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18916/?]Lanterns of Skyrim[/url] by MannyGT\r<br />Recommended[url=http://enbdev.com/enbseries/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1930]\r<br />[/url][url=http://enbdev.com/enbseries/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1930]Enhanced Lighting for ENB[/url] by Jawz\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40729/?]ELEP - Full Vanilla Customizable ENB[/url] by Jawz",
