  "descriptionHtml": "Replaces the main theme, to \\\"Misty Mountains Cold,\\\" from the Hobbit Trailer.\r\nI felt that it really suited the game, and would make a perfect theme.\r\n\r\nDirections, (they are quite easy.)\r\n\r\n1. unpack the \\\"Data\\\" folder from the rar\r\n\r\n2. place the \\\"Data\\\" folder in the Skyrim main directory.\r\n\r\n3. Run Skyrim and enjoy.\r\n\r\nIncompatibilities:\r\nThis mod should run flawlessly with any mod that doesn\\'t replace the main theme. If you by some chance already have a theme replace, then this mod WILL replace it. \r\n\r\nLet me know how you like it, and please endorse if you do happen to like it.",
