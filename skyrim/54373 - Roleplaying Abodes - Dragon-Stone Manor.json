  "descriptionHtml": "A rather pleasant manor near Dragon Bridge. it includes dynamic and interactive furniture, but it is not yet complete. This is due to the help of DavideMitra, who provided me with a tutorial as of how to do it. You should check out his best mod - The House of the Redguard - (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54162/?).\r<br />\r<br />The house is not yet finished, but is around seven tenths of the way there, as it only needs a little more furniture, and some other great additions. \r<br />\r<br />When you approach the door, you will notice that it is locked with &#39;master&#39;. Go back outside, and face  the door, from the grass. Look right down, and you will notice something, probably. A small lockbox, containing the key.\r<br />\r<br />Note: The house is most certainly WIP, but is mostly done. Don&#39;t want to see it half-made? Then just click &#39;track&#39;.",
