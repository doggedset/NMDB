  "descriptionHtml": "[center][font=Impact][color=orange][size=60]REGS - A Real Explorer&#39;s Guide to Skyrim[/size][/color][/font][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#D3CE3D]Let&#39;s[/color] admit it. Skyrim is a great game, but it suffers terribly from a lack of life overall. Does the great empire really only consist of mini settlements with some farmers in them? The cities are too small and underpopulated. Most of the towns seem deserted. Even its capital, Solitude, is smaller than the average city in Oblivion. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#D3CE3D]This [/color]guide&#39;s goal is to provide players with a mod compilation that will finally turn Skyrim into a country that feels alive, without derailing from the original game&#39;s style. You will not find any over the top mods here. Mods that had overpowered, non-fitting or broken contents were stripped from those parts. The Explorer&#39;s Guide attempts to hold true to the intended spirit of the game and is generally lore-friendly.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#D3CE3D]What [/color]we wanted to achieve is to bring you a modlist which you would like to use permanently in all of your next playthroughs. Regardless of which other mods have been installed. Enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />[center][color=#FAD089][size=50]Content[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#D3CE3D]Within[/color] the guide you will find more than 20 mods which combined will bring a sense of true civilization to Skyrim. Only the highest quality mods have been selected. More than 100 hours were spent on fixing navmeshes and ironing out hundreds of other issues.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#D3CE3D]With [/color]permission from the mod authors, we have made numerous fixes to some mods and we have made all the mods in this list 100% compatible with eachother and with the Unofficial Patches. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#D3CE3D]How[/color] does this work? You download the original mod as instructed and follow our directions to the letter. At the end, a patch will be provided via our FOMOD installer which fixes any and all issues that arise out of using this mod combination. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#D3CE3D]Please[/color] endorse the work of the original mod authors&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#D3CE3D]This [/color]guide will provide you with:\r<br />\r<br />[list][*]Cleaned and CTD-free mods[*]Conflict resolution[*]Grey face bug fixes[*]Merged ESPs[*]Navmesh Fixes[*]Optimal mod combinations[*]Proper NPC behaviour packages[*]Removed incompatible or low quality content[*]Revamped versions of outdated mods[*]Same cell edit fixes[/list]\r<br />[b][color=#D3CE3D]Once [/color]again: Most of our fixes are included in a FOMOD installer for your convenience&#33;[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />[center][color=#FAD089][size=50]Compatibility[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#D3CE3D]REGS [/color]has been designed for 100% compatibility with the following guides and/or packs:\r<br />[list][*][url=http://wiki.step-project.com/User:Neovalen/Skyrim_Revisited_-_Legendary_Edition] Skyrim Revisited: Legendary Edition [/url] [*][url=http://wiki.step-project.com/STEP:2.2.8] Skyrim Total Enhancement Project [/url][/list]\r<br />[color=#D3CE3D]REGS [/color]has been made 100% compatible with (but not dependent on) the following mods:\r<br />[list][*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15508/?] Better Fast Travel - Carriages and Ships[/url][*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8429/?] Interesting NPCs[/url][*]Lighting Mods (ELFX, RLO, RS, ELE)[/url][*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38529/?] Touring Carriages[/url][*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19/?] Unofficial Skyrim Patches[/url][/list]\r<br />[color=#D3CE3D]REGS[/color]  is known to be incompatible with the following mods:\r<br />[list][*][url=http://wiki.step-project.com/Chimneys_for_Skyrim] Chimneys of Skyrim[/url][*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8058/?] Open Cities Skyrim[/url][/list]\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />[center][color=#FAD089][size=50]Requirements[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#D3CE3D]REGS [/color]does not have any other mod pre-requisites of its own.
