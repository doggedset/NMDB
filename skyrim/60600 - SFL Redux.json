  "descriptionHtml": "[b]SFL Redux - A Player Home\n<br />[/b]This mod aims to make a proper player home from Sinderion's Field Lab. In addition to a few minor interior changes, it adds a Dwemer tower (making slight changes to the geography around it, didn't feel like fixing it), And a full crafting station behind the added tower. The tower itself serves no purpose. More additions will be added to this mod in the future, but I made it just for a single one of my own character's. This mod also changes the name to \"Field Laboratory\" as I found it illogical to leave it as \"Sinderion's\" if you plan on using it as a player home yoursself. All associated quests should still work.Â \n<br />\n<br />[i]I have to halt this mod, as I have lost all of my updates to it when I reinstalled skyrim and, like the idiot I am, forgot to back up all of the mods I've been working on -about 15 in total x.x-[/i]",
