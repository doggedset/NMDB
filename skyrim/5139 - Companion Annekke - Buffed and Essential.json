  "descriptionHtml": "There are those who thinks that Aela the Hunter is the hottest hottie in Skyrim \r\nand the only way to go when they are choosing companion in the game .. i dont.\r\n\r\nIn the little miningcommunity called Darkwater Crossing lives Annekke. \r\nShe used to be an adventurer she says - and if you help her out with some bandits OR if you help her daughter Sylgja,\r\nshe will follow you if you want to. She does not marry you though as she already is married.\r\n(Her daughter is avaliable for marriage though ..)\r\n\r\nI buffed up her stats for heavy armor, archery, one-handed, block, destruction e.t.c.\r\nand gave her some spells and gear that makes her a very good little helper in fights.\r\nShe is a \\\"human missile\\\" wich means that she fights with ranged weapons rather than\r\nrushing head on into trouble .. keeps her out of the way too.\r\n\r\nYou will have to provide her with armor and meleeweapon yourself if you want her to have that,\r\nshe does have a dagger and a nice bow already .. you might wat to trade with her some .. \r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nJust drop the .esp into your Skyrim/Data folder and make sure the mod is active in the launcher.\r\n\r\nUn-installation: Remove the .esp or just de-activate it.",
