  "summary": "Cosmetic changed to Uthgerd to make her more appealing.  This is a personal mod I use so I thought I&#39;d share with the community.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;m not an experienced mod maker, just an amateur with an opinion.  Vanilla Uthgerd is old and ugly, there&#39;s no denying it.  After finally figuring out how to correctly use the NPC editor, I tried my hand at making a better looking Uthgerd and wanted to share my opinion with the community.  I changed her name to Ashari, after an aggressive and promiscuous girl I dated back in high school.\r<br />\r<br />Her combat is pretty much the same.  She&#39;s a beast with a 2 handed weapons, namely greatswords, and has perks to match.  Her level scales with the player, she&#39;s quieter for those of you who are the sneaky type, and shouldn&#39;t trigger pressure plate traps.  If you like it, please endorse.\r<br />\r<br />**Note** I accidentally uploaded an earlier version that was not stealth friendly.  If you want the quieter version, please use 1.5\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />ApachiiSkyHair - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?\r<br />The Eyes of Beauty - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722\r<br />\r<br />Recommended: (to look like the screenshots)\r<br />CBBE female body replacer - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666\r<br />Better females by Bella - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2812 (no makeup version)\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Use NMM or simply drop the .esp and the .bsa files into the Data folder.  It&#39;s that simple.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />Use NMM or simply delete the .esp and the .bsa files from the Data folder.  It&#39;s that simple.\r<br />\r<br />Conflicts:\r<br />If you&#39;re using UFO (Ultimate Follower Overhaul - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14037), make sure this mod is loaded AFTER UFO, or you&#39;ll get the discolored vanilla head bug.  It may just be doing this on my machine, but I don&#39;t have the slightest idea why it happens.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to the Nexus modding community, you guys make it possible to enjoy playing the same games over and over and over...\r<br />\r<br />Special Thanks to FalmerBane.  After using many of his beautifully done replacers, it inspired me to make some of my own.",
