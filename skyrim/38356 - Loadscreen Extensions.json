Load order isn\\'t an issue as all my screens have been designed not to conflict or be read before/after other mods.\r\n[color=#b22222][font=times new roman,times,serif][size=7][u][b]Compatibility[/b][/u][/size][/font][/color]\r\nYep! Compatible with everything, don\\'t worry about it :D\r\n[color=#b22222][font=times new roman,times,serif][size=7][u][b]Credits[/b][/u][/size][/font][/color]\r\nThe Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages (or UESPWiki) and it\\'s contributors\r\nThe Elder Scrolls Wiki and it\\'s contributors\r\nOaristys for Modders Resource Pack - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16525/?\r\n[color=#b22222][font=times new roman,times,serif][size=7][u][b]Feedback[/b][/u][/size][/font][/color]\r\nI am treating this a WIP even though it is a complete mod, just because I enjoy playing around with statics so expect more screens to come in future updates.  Feel free to give me some ideas of what to add for others screens.\r\nLeave bug reports, suggestions, ideas, etc. in the comments on my mod page. Thanks and enjoy :D",
