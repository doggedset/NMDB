  "descriptionHtml": "Vampirism Dawn of Blood 1.1F\r\n\r\nDawn of Blood version 1.1F features 7 stage Vampirism as well as including a new faction ranking system which gives additional powers. This is the first mod on Skyrim Nexus that actually has 7 stages of Vampirism instead of 4. It also replaces the silly message which says you get stronger by not feeding and weaker by feeding. In Dawn of Blood, you get stronger by feeding and weaker by not feeding. As such, the spells and abilities also work that way.\r\n\r\nAdds a new feeding ability Rampage for Blood, as soon as player hits Stage 3 of starvation they get the ability to feed on dead bodies. Note that upon feeding the player loses the perk again until adequately starved. This is intended prevent farming feed points from corpses like was originally possible.\r\n\r\nWARNING:Take note that you cant feed at all unless you starved to stage 3+ this was made to prevent neck farming like in many idiotic vampirisism mode where the people would just get vampire at lvl 50 then sit by a bed and spam the feed click. well sorry peoples thats not gunna ever happen again now. When you feed you loose the vampirismfeed perk for around 2 day (stage 3) so to prevent farming. How often you drink is up to you you can let yourself starve till you ring the big red bell or actualy drink every 3 day like a bloodcrazed monster ;)\r\n\r\nWhen leveling up in the Faction you\\'ll have a warning transition message along with a new ability Keep note that in most case the level prerequisite is also equal to the number of time feed prerequisite:\r\n\r\nRank 1: Detect Blood Pulse (Basically Detect Life at a distance, and is used in the shout slot. Requires LVL: 2) 1 neck\r\nRank 2: Drain Stamina (Makes your Drain Life spell also drain the same amount of Stamina. Requires LVL: 10) 5 neck\r\nRank 3: Muffled Movement (Your vampire is now 25% lighter when sneaking. Requires LVL: 15) 10 neck\r\nRank 4: Unholy Frenzy (This perk allows you to attack faster and regenerate stamina faster under the moonlight. Requires LVL: 20) 15 neck\r\nRank 5: Cloak of Shadow (As a permanent power. Requires LVL: 25) 20 neck\r\nRank 6: Improved Dreadcloak (ameliored version of cloak of shadow wich act like the shadowcloak of nocturnal rather then a lesser power this spell replace cloak of shadow once learned Requires LVL: 30) 25 neck\r\nRank 7: Freeze Prism (A deadly Ice attack which sacrifices your own health for damage. Requires LVL: 35) 30 neck\r\nRank 8: Vampiric Touch (Sucks out the life of a foe once a day. This is basically a killing spell which rarely fails altrough the full effect takes 4 minutes, eventually doing a total of 3600 damage and healing you for the same amount - this is a damage over time attack. Requires LVL: 40) 35 neck\r\nRank 9: Drain Magicka (Allows your drain life to also drain the same amount of magicka therefore making the spell free long as the target has magicka for you to take. Requires LVL: 45) 40 neck\r\nRank 10: Summon Shadowhound (summon a deadly cerberus with load of health who will assist you in battle by drawing the attention and taking blows for you this pet can be summoned at will and has stats based on the main characters Requires LVL: 50) 50 neck\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVampire Stages\r\n\r\nAll stages:\r\n+50 Health, Stamina and Magicka (These bonuses apply at all times but may be nullified by the sun damage)\r\n+100 resistance to Paralysis, Disease and Poison\r\nvampire Cloak\r\n\r\nStage 1:\r\nVamp Drain 35 HP, costs 35 Mana (Has additional effects if you have the Drain Magicka and Drain Stamina perks)\r\nvamp Servants (Can resurrect a monster up to LVL 70 for a close to infinite duration)\r\n+35 Unarmed damage\r\n-65 Health, Mana and Stamina under the Sun and 100% regeneration of them (which means you dont regenerate any slower or faster than normal)\r\n30 Weakness to Fire\r\n100 Resistance to Cold\r\n\r\nStage 2:\r\nVamp Drain 30 HP, costs 30 Mana (Additional effects if you have the two perks)\r\nVamp Servants (can resurrect a monster up to LVL 60 for a close to infinite duration)\r\n+30 Unarmed damage\r\n-80 Health, Mana and Stamina under the Sun and 75% regeneration of them (Regenerates 25% slower)\r\n40 weakness to fire\r\n90 resistance to cold\r\n\r\nStage 3:\r\nVamp Drain 25 HP, costs 25 Mana (Additional effects if you have the two perks)\r\nVamp Servants (can resurrect a monster up to LVL 50 for a close to infinite duration)\r\n+25 unarmed damage\r\n-95 Health, Mana and Stamina under the Sun and 50% regeneration of them (Regenerates 50% slower)\r\n50 weakness to fire\r\n80 resistance to cold\r\n\r\nStage 4\r\nVamp Drain 20 HP, costs 20 Mana (Additional effects if you have the two perks)\r\nVamp Servants (can resurrect a monster up to LVL 40 for 3600 second)\r\n+20 Unarmed damage\r\n-110 Health, Mana and Stamina under the Sun and 25% regeneration of them (Regenerates 75% slower)\r\n60 weakness to fire\r\n70 resistance to cold\r\n\r\nStage 5\r\nVamp Drain 15 HP, costs 15 Mana (Additional effects if you have the two perks)\r\nVamp Servants (can resurrect a monster up to LVL 30 for 3600 seconds)\r\n+15 Unarmed damage\r\n-125 Health, Mana and Stamina under the Sun and 0% regeneration of them (Unless you have a bonus, regeneration is totally removed)\r\n70 Weakness to Fire\r\n60 Resistance to Cold\r\n\r\nStage 6\r\nVamp Drain 10 HP, costs 10 Mana (Additional effects if you have the two perks)\r\nVamp Servants (can resurrect a monster up to LVL 10 for 3600 seconds)\r\n+10 Unarmed damage\r\n-140 Health, Mana and Stamina under the Sun and 0% regeneration of them (Unless you have a bonus, regeneration is totally removed)\r\n80 Weakness to Fire\r\n50 Resistance to Cold\r\n\r\nStage 7\r\nVamp Drain 5 HP, costs 5 Mana (Additional effects if you have the two perks)\r\nVamp Servants (Can resurrect a monster up to LVL 5 for 60 seconds)\r\n+5 Unarmed damage\r\n-150 Health, Mana and Stamina under the Sun and 0% regeneration of them (Unless you have a bonus, regeneration is totally removed)\r\n100 Weakness to Fire\r\n30 Resistance to Cold\r\nAnd of course, everyone wants you dead and will attack you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncompatibility:\r\nProbably incompatible with close to every Vampirism mod because of a direct script change and the very fact its currently the only mode with 7 stages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREDIT\r\nMain scripting and spell designer: Coolster (also known as Kyubi3002 on steam)\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks:\r\nArkelius for fixing a few serious bugs in the faction script allowing the work to progress further\r\nSilasWolfe: For grammar fix on the home page\r\nCDM (for teaching me the love of moding vampirism and lycantropy related stuff)",
