  "summary": "Forge that can craft any Skyforge or DLC forgable items. (And default items of course.)",
  "descriptionHtml": "Before anything this requires all three DLC : Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn.\r\nIt also requires Skyrim to be updated to 1.9.32.0.8\r\n\r\nI did not upload pictures because, it just a basic forge that just has all the forge crafting keywords there was no need for pictures.\r\n\r\nJust something I made for myself and figured I would post it. (I didnt check to see if some one else had done this so sorry if they have.)\r\n\r\nIts just a forge that has the skyforge keywords and DLC forge keywords allowing you to make any forgable items at one place. This doesnt place a forge in game any where, if you want me to place a few leave some idea\\'s other then that its more of a resource for modders that want this. (just give me credit) I can also make individual items craftable there are any ideas (I striped those out for the first upload to see if people would even like this. (ive made other mods but this is my first uploaded) If people like it and leave ideas ill add to it.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0\r\n - First Upload\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n - Fixed Lunar Forge (Can now craft lunar weapons)\r\n - Added a trapdoor leading to a room with the All Forge in it.\r\n - Added optional file to replace the Hearthfire house basement forge to these.",
