  "descriptionHtml": "What&#39;s going on guys? This is my fourth mod, which improves the Forsworn Bow. \r<br />\r<br />It increases the speed to 1.35 (from 0.8750) and increases the damage to 36 (from 12). \r<br />\r<br />The improved bow&#39;s name is Bow of the Reach. It can be bought in Arnleif and Sons in Markarth. \r<br />\r<br />This mod should be compatible with all mods. \r<br />\r<br />Also on the Steam Workshop at http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=254628332\r<br />\r<br />I would really appreciate suggestions, critiques, etc. Also if it doesnâ€™t work with a mod or just doesn&#39;t work, please let me know. \r<br />\r<br />If you enjoy this mod, please, leave a like. It helps get this mod noticed. \r<br />\r<br />Thumbnail and screenshots taken and edited by me.",
