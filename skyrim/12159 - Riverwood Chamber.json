I don\\'t plan on adding or changing anything to the file.\r\nThere is one small area where the shadow flickers, after spending a few hours relighting the place four times I decided to just leave it. (It\\'s not too bad)\r\n\r\nIts a small Dwemer style player home with all things that you would need, Forge, Smelter, Woodcutter, Kitchen, Bedroom, Alchemy (with plants for potions), Enchanter, and a large indoor garden with plants ready to be picked.\r\n\r\nAdded a second version requested by Kevuorkian.\r\nSecond version is an assassin\\'s style, shortened the rooms and added in some DB inspired decorations to the main hall.",
