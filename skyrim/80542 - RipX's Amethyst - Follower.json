The Shyeri clan was a magic based clan of Redguard folk. Sadly, the woman’s father, a commander in the Breton empire at that time was not okay with Breton women, including his daughter, marrying outside of their race. Their relationship was threatened and the Breton empire cast her out. The Shyeri, being much more accepting of such things, took them in with open arms. The couple was married and the woman became pregnant. The child was beautiful…not dark, not pale, and strangely enough, had been born with purple hair and eyebrows. Her mother called her a blessing and a jewel…and named her Amethyst. A year later, she gave birth again, to a stunning red-head with red eyes, who she named Ruby. This little purple-haired girl grew up with battle as her focus. Her father was sure that Amethyst may encounter the same racism that they had, and wanted to make sure that Amethyst would be able to handle herself. He trained her in the forests daily, even though village rules forbid women training for battle. Over the next 19 years Amethyst became a well-trained and beautiful woman and warrior. One day, after a long journey to solitude, she returned to the clan village only to find the village burned to the ground. Searching for her parents, she found a lone survivor in the rubble. Amethyst then learned that while she was gone, the village had condemned and publicly killed a husband and wife (not her parents) for training their daughter to fight, which, as they knew, was against their village rules. Upon seeing their deaths, the daughter, named Rolonce’, flew into a rage and unleashed an incredible magic lightning barrage that destroyed the entire village, and everyone in it… including Amethyst’s parents.  Three years have passed since that day. Gone are the days of adventure and training. Revenge and vengeance are the only things that drive Amethyst now. She scours Skyrim, looking for the woman responsible for taking the only things that ever mattered to her. She is a wanderer, craving only battle and occasionally the company of another. Most times she is seen in Solitude, where she enjoys watching the beheadings that occur near the front of the city… the kind of justice that makes her think of what she will do when she finds her parent’s killer. She will make Rolonce’ pay the ultimate price for what she did to her parents… and on top of all that, there was still the matter of Ruby, her younger sister. Ruby frequently went on long pilgrimages to the east, and was already gone when Amethyst left on that fateful journey. … could Ruby still be alive? \n<br />\n<br />[img]https://s5.postimg.cc/q8kmqqt53/Info.png[/img]\n<br />Name:  Amethyst\n<br />Voice:  Female Commander\n<br />Marriageable:  Yes\n<br />Height:  1.00\n<br />Weight:  68\n<br />Body:  UNP &amp;
