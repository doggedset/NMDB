  "descriptionHtml": "This is a small mod for those who want\r\na) convenient exterior homes in Riverwood or Morthal\r\nb) wanted a stable in Riverwood or a place to place followers conveniently\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod(s) which i planned to use as a base for a later more extensive mod i was planning, but decided to upload.\r\n\r\nTher Riverwood camp\r\nRiverwood camp is just outside the gates to Falkreath and is out of the way, with two ways to reach it, stairs on the road \\'bout 10 feet away from the gates or a natural hill from the corner of Riverwood right up to it. There is a magical torch next to the stairs.\r\nThis camp which also adds the stable where the guard outpost was, and a small boat directly across from the camp for no real reason other than I thought Riverwood would have a boat considering it was on the river, includes:\r\n a table,\r\n cooking pot,\r\n 4 tents (3 small, one large),\r\n 3 bedrolls, one cot in large tent for the player,\r\n a chest which doesnt respawn in the large tent,\r\n an alchemy and enchanting workbench with ingredient barrels which do respawn,\r\n sit markers for npc\\'s,\r\n and a random spawning chest and barrel.\r\n\r\nThe Morthal camp\r\nThe Morthal camp is located directly NorthEast of the sawmill on the North side of the river,\r\nand includes the same things as the Riverwood camp.\r\n\r\nI chose these places because they were my favorite places to go (The Riverwood came first as a place to keep my stuff early on and used until I arrived at Morthal which I liked and thought it needed a house) and needed easy lodgings.\r\nIf there are any problems (which I\\'m almost sure there will be) please comment but know I will not be able to fix for at least a week or two. \r\n\r\nShould work with most mods (even Riverwood Gates) except those that add things where my things are of course haha\r\n\r\nRequired Mods: NONE\r\n\r\nRecommended Mods:\r\n-Paradise Halls and all its extenders and add-ons -\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29886]Here[/url]\r\n-Any mod where spouses can live anywhere, particularly -\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11370]Here[/url]\r\n-My home is your home-\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18045]Here[/url]\r\n-Riverwood Gates-\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9476]Here[/url]\r\n-My other mod Morthal A True Hold:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35141]Here[/url]\r\n-Characters in pics are my custom characters and a team I will add in the future.\r\n\r\nThank you and enjoy!",
