  "descriptionHtml": "A nice little player home for those players that want a small home to live in and not a big extravagant home. It\\'s located near whiterun and you should see it on your map. This home has all crafting things(cooking,smithing,alchemy,enchanting), listed containers for organization and ease, a horse and a stable, a mannequin, and some other little bits and pieces. To get into the home you need a key which is located around the house somewhere and I\\'ll give you a hint on where it is. It has 4 legs and it lost its bark at some point in its lifetime. pretty easy, yes, if not, then you suck at life, just kidding. \r\nThis is my first uploaded and finished mod, there will be more, not just player homes. I would like pointers, suggestion,and any complaints you have with this mod so i can fix and improve my mod and incorporate them into my other mods. Right now it\\'s only me modding so i\\'ll be slow with getting other mods out right now and i\\'m learning as i go along so don\\'t expect perfection in my mods when they come out but i\\'ll always strive for it. thanks and have fun with this mod or try it out if you haven\\'t already downloaded it.\r\nNice 31 downloads and 2 endorsements, I\\'m moving up in the world of skyrim ",
