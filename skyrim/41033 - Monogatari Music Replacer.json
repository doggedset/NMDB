  "summary": "A 99% lore friendly mod made to make the same experiences feel new.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Finished asking for permissions finally :DDDD Anyways on a more serious note this mod is a compilation of many different songs used from  lot of different shows. This mod should be 99% lore friendly but dependent on your views it might not be completely. You might recognise some of the songs here if you have the same hobby as me or if you watch MMOxreview since he has a combat song that is used from one of the shows I put in here. \r\n\r\nI made this mod to try to freshen up skyrim a little because after playing it for the hundredth time things get a little boring :P This mod suits someone who hasn\\'t been enjoying skyrim recently and wants something new. You\\'d be surprised show much music changes your experience.\r\n\r\nSorry for the huge download that just a side effect of the way I made this mod there is no way I can change this without out remaking the mod and that\\'s not something I\\'m very interested in sadly :(\r\n\r\nIf you like a song and don\\'t know where its from please leave \r\na comment asking for the name, the best way to tell me what song you\\'re after is to get a time stamp from one of the demo videos I have posted. I\\'ll try to respond to every one but I might forget to check lol.  \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy my mod :P\r\n\r\nCOMBAT SONGS\r\n[center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[youtube]Z3xpIRit0D4[/youtube]\r\n\r\n\r\n[/center]\r\n\r\nADVENTURE \r\n[center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[youtube]D2xfmT6-M90[/youtube]\r\n\r\n\r\n[/center] \r\n\r\nNIGHT\r\n[center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[youtube]JJIgDqSc76w[/youtube]\r\n\r\n\r\n[/center] \r\n\r\nTOWNS\r\n[center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[youtube]Xi7tSmvbHkw[/youtube]\r\n\r\n\r\n[/center] \r\n\r\nAll Music does not belong to me, If you would like to purchase any of these artists work you can find them on amazon.\r\nYoshihisa Hirano \r\nMikio Endo Toshio Masuda Shir?
