  "descriptionHtml": "It\\'s Navi! \r\n\r\nShe will follow you and give you quests.\r\n\r\nShe can be found in the entryway of Dragonsreach in Whiterun. \r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\nShe is marked as essential (can\\'t die). \r\nShe can carry your things.\r\nYou can hire her for free. \r\nIf you dismiss her she will stay there, so you can put her in your house or where ever you want. \r\nShe gives bounty quests.\r\nAdded Link\\'s Armor in Smithing.\r\nAdded Navi\\'s Hideaway just outside of Riverwood.  \r\n\r\nWarning:\r\n\r\nMods alter the game, (by design).\r\n\r\nIf you uninstall a mod without dismissing the follower from that mod the game will still think you have a follower and you will be unable to hire another. \r\n\r\nIt is a good practice to make a save before trying new mods and/or save without any of the mod components attached to your character, i.e. Followers, Armor, Zones, Quests, Spells. \r\n\r\nCommand Console: Dismiss Follower (set playerfollowercount to 0) \r\n\r\nAny feedback is appreciated. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nv1.1Update: Now with 100% less annoying sound. \r\n\r\nv1.2Update: Added cartable Link\\'s Armor.\r\n-Under Misc. in Smithing.
