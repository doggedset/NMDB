  "descriptionHtml": "Helgen Rebuilt Stage 1\r\n\r\nNew Helgen Rebuilt Mod available here, please read all of the description carefully.\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=385621\r\n\r\nTHESE MODS ARE NO LONGER IN DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nThis is Stage 1 of the Helgen Rebuilt mod which removes all but two of the bandits in the town.\r\n\r\nThis mod will be made in four stages:\r\nStage 1-No bandits\r\nStage 2-Nature Reclaims Helgen\r\nStage 3-Workers and builders move in\r\nStage 4-The village is rebuilt\r\n\r\nThis mod has been made in this way so that you can pick and choose which stage you woudl like. DO NOT HAVE MORE THAN ONE STAGE ACTIVE AT A TIME.\r\n\r\nStage 2 will be uploaded soon.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows where the two remaining bandits spawn from, please let me know in the comments section. I went through each of Helgen\\'s cells in the Tamriel worldspace and deleted the bandits, but two of them still spawn. Any ideas on how to fix this would be welcome.\r\n\r\nNOTICE: It is recommended that this mod is only used after the player has escaped Helgen. It is also recommended that this mod is used after the completion of the main quest, although using it before this will most likely be fine.\r\n\r\nI have also put this mod on the steam workshop.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nExtract the contents of the file.\r\nCopy the HelgenRebuiltStage1.esp file into your Skyrim/Data folder.\r\nActivate the mod in your data files section of the Skyrim launcher.\r\nPLay the game.\r\n\r\nCredit, of course, to Bethesda for making such a great game.",
