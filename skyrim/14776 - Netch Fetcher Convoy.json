  "descriptionHtml": "Adds an abandoned caravan on the coast north-west of Dawnstar.  Judging by the decor, it must have been transport for Dunmer refugees before it broke down.  I wonder what happened to them?  Maybe it has something to do with the nearby troll cave.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n• bedroll\r\n• fast travel map marker\r\n• plenty of storage!\r\n• all containers will not respawn (safe to store your loot)\r\n• cooking pot\r\n• alchemy table\r\n• weapon grinding wheel\r\n• DOMESTIC MUDCRAB\r\n\r\nAs always, backup your saves before trying a new mod. I can\\'t promise everything is working perfectly. If there are any problems leave a comment and I will address it.\r\n\r\nView the Rusty Antler Caravan here!\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14414\r\nView the Gleaming Salvage Caravan here!\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14444\r\nView the Rabbit\\'s Foot Caravan here!\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14363\r\n\r\nNote: As soon as I work a few things out, I will be merging all caravans into one .esp file.  Keep a look out for when that happens because I will be taking these down and moving them over to that page.",
