Here you'll find 8 styles of pubic hair as well as many different colors available for your choosing. Meshes come pre-built with Bodyslide files included for CBBE and UUNP.[/size][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=5]SLOT USAGE and CONFLICT[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]The hairs use slot 49 when equipped. \n<br />\n<br />As such it will conflict with any armor mod piece that uses that slot.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][b][size=4][b][size=4][size=5]Old vs. New[/size][/size][/b][/size][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />So your asking, what is it that's new or different? Functionally it's quite the same but underneath the hood however...\n<br />\n<br />*Old version had over 64 different meshes to be built in Bodyslide, This version you only need to build 8. The plugin file now handles all the color variations.\n<br />\n<br />*Hair textures have been improved to look more... hair like. Thanks Google images.\n<br />\n<br />*Crafting now requires that you have grooming clippers in your inventory to craft. This was done to keep crafting menu clutter down.\n<br />\n<br />*Added a \"CUSTOM HAIR\" color category to allow users to make a hair color that closely matches their chosen color for hair.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][b][size=4][size=5]WHAT IS \"[color=#ff0000]C[/color][color=#980000]U[/color][color=#ff7700]S[/color][color=#ffff00]T[/color][color=#00ff00]O[/color][color=#00ffff]M[/color] [color=#1e84cc]H[/color][color=#0000ff]A[/color][color=#9900ff]I[/color][color=#ff00ff]R[/color]\" COLOR and HOW TO USE IT[/size][/size][/b][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />\"Custom Hair\" color is a special hair color set aside for users who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty by manually editing the \"CustomMatch.dds\" file, to make a custom hair color that better matches the hair color on the head of your character.\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/articles/51094/]CLICK HERE FOR FULL INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN COLOR!!![/url]\n<br />[color=#ff7700]\n<br />[size=5]REQUIREMENTS[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />A legit up-to-date version of Skyrim\n<br />\n<br />Your choice of any nude female body replacer.\n<br />\n<br />Bodyslide 2.0 and Outfit Studio.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=5]Location and Acquisition[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />The grooming pouch can be found at an unmarked bandit camp just outside of Helgen. \n<br />\n<br />From there have any grooming clipper that best matches your hair color in your inventory, and craft at any tanning rack using a wolf pelt.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=5]Qu and Ah[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Q. Do I need to build the UUNP files in Bodyslide if I'm using a UUNP type body?\n<br />\n<br />Not really no. The hairs are made to work with any body right out the box. The UUNP files are there for those who want the hairs to fit better with their custom shaped UUNP body.\n<br />\n<br />Q. Still don't know what shame is anymore do you?\n<br />\n<br />Nope.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=5]CREDITS[/size][/color][/center][/size][/b][/size][/b][center]\n<br />[size=4]Elite Cheat - The originator of the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49711/?]Cubic Hairs 3D mod[/url] and for being nice enough to allow open permissions of his work.
