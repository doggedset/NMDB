  "descriptionHtml": "I created this mod mostly for myself a while back because I liked the idea of elemental visual effects. I hadn\\'t publshed a mod before (this is my first one), so I figured I would share this with others. It adds the effect rings to the Riverwood Trader vendor.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This mod ONLY adds the enchanted rings. It does not include the armor sets in the image.\r\n\r\nArmor sets are recolors I have done. The white was originally \\\"Divine Aegis\\\" (can be found on Nexus), and the black is a gold-trimmed ebony recolor. Also seen is Ebony Ascention (on the black set) from the Plate Hoods mod.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n* Adds rings with enchantable visual effects.\r\n   **   Snowborn - Frost visual effect - Frost covers the wearer along with a cloud effect.\r\n   **   Flamewreath - Fire visual effect - Wearer glows fiery orange along with emanating flames.\r\n   **   Stormshod - Electric visual effect - Wearer glows electric purple-blue with emanating electrical sparks.\r\n   **   Darkling - Shadow visual effect - Wearer is shrouded in darkness with emanating black mist.\r\n   **   Soulbreak - \\\"Life\\\" visual effect - Wearer glows light orange and emanates energy similar to greybeard soulsharing.\r\n   **   Icecube - joke ring \\\"icecube\\\" effect - You become an icecube.\r\n* Rings can be disenchanted to learn the enchantments\r\n* Enchantments can be stacked with other enchantments on armor.\r\n* Effects are visual ONLY - they do not incur any damage or gameplay buffs/debuffs to player or NPCs.\r\n* Effects have been modified from their original game values to something more unique, so while similar, they are not mere copies.\r\n\r\nFuture Thoughts:\r\n* Make \\\"icecube\\\" ring turn the wearer into a frost atronach.\r\n* Possibly add flame/frost trail effects, or a separate enchantment which contains them to make it optional.\r\n* Blended rings with effects not seen in the game.\r\n\r\nThis mod can also be found on the Steam Workshop: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=86593222]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=86593222[/url]\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n** Added rings Soulbreak, Darkling, Stormshod and Icecube\r\n** Made Flamewreathe more fiery.\r\n** Made Snowborn a little more frosty.",
