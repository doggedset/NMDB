Here\\'s a few details about what I\\'ve done...\r\n\r\nNEW ITEM: Link\\'s Tunic (Standalone Item)\r\n- I\\'ve taken the Farm Clothing that looks very much like Link\\'s Tunic and made a craftable, temperable/upgradeable standalone version called \r\n\r\nLink\\'s Tunic. I\\'ve made it a light armor with the same base armor rating as Daedric Armor. I\\'ve balanced the armor\\'s rating by requiring some \r\n\r\nhigher level requirements in order to smith it, making it only obtainable further along in the game. \r\n\r\nIN-GAME DESCRIPTION: An ancient tunic that was said to be worn by a glorious Hero.\r\nBASE ARMOR RATING: 49 (Same as Daedric Armor)\r\nWEIGHT: 1\r\nVALUE: 5600\r\nSMITHING REQUIREMENTS: Iron Ingot, Leather (2), Leather Strips (3)\r\nPERK REQUIREMENTS: Elven Smithing, Arcane Blacksmith\r\nTEMPER/UPGRADE REQUIREMENTS: Iron Ingot (3)\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n\r\nBUGS: None that I could find, please contact me if you find any.\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n\r\nFUTURE VERSIONS: \r\n- Better Balance (Please leave feedback)\r\n- Several Colors to reflect other Tunic\\'s from the Zelda Series\r\n- Matching Enchantments that reflect respective abilities from the Zelda Series Tunics\r\n- Retexture of Gauntlets and Boots to match Twilight Princess Gauntlets and Boots\r\n- Quiver Retexture(s)\r\n- User Requests (I\\'d love to hear them)\r\n- New Models and Textures (With help from other modders, as I am incapable of doing so myself)\r\n\r\n*See \\\"Future Versions\\\"",
