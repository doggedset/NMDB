  "summary": "Beauties of Skyrim is the perfect companion to Pinup Poser, and provides an in game reference for the poses.\r\n",
  "descriptionHtml": " If you have used Halofarm\\'s, \\\"Pinup Poser\\\", then you know it\\'s a great mod. However, the one thing that is missing, is an in game reference for the poses. With Beauties of Skyrim 2 Point Oh, you now have 9 books, that cover all 405 poses.\r\n\r\n  Beauties of Skyrim Vol.1 Sitting Poses\r\n  Beauties of Skyrim Vol.2 Laying Poses\r\n  Beauties of Skyrim Vol.3 Kneeling Poses\r\n  Beauties of Skyrim Vol.4a Standing Poses\r\n  Beauties of Skyrim Vol.4b Standing Poses\r\n  Beauties of Skyrim Vol.5a Standing Poses\r\n  Beauties of Skyrim Vol.5b Standing Poses\r\n  Beauties of Skyrim Vol.6a Standing Poses\r\n  Beauties of Skyrim Vol.6b Standing Poses\r\n\r\nThe books can be found in Dragon\\'s Reach, On Farengar\\'s desk. Like Belethor, he\\'s a sleazy little man, but he has good stock.\r\n\r\n Using the reference guide is easy. There are 2 letter/number designations at the top, or bottom of each image. The first is the Idle group, and the second is the actual Idle animation. I.E. (S2) - (S8), will play the eighth Idle animation, of the second group.\r\nFavorite the Idle rings. Use the \\\"Idle Select Ring\\\" to select the Idle animation.\r\nUse the \\\"Idle Play Ring\\\" to Play the Idle animation.\r\n\r\nThanks to Halofarm for creating a great mod, and to DoppelgangerAlpha for his large contribution of screenshots, that I used in Vol.4a - Vol.5b.\r\n\r\n  Please let me know is there are any issues that need my attention. \r\n\r\nRequirements: This is only a reference guide to the actual mod. You will need to download Halofarm\\'s Pinup Poser. I have just learned that Halofarm has left the nexus. I don\\'t know the details at the moment. Below is the new link to his mod. http://mod.dysintropi.me/mods/skyrim/\r\n\r\n   Thanks for taking the time to check out my mod. Enjoy.",
