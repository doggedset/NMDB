  "summary": "adds 5 lecterns to scribe scrolls and scrolls into spell tomes. need inkwell and quill to use the lectern, and for crafting the scroll, you need to know the spell and have apprentice lvl perk in that spell&#39;s school. you also need a roll of parchment (roll of paper, but changed name) and a varying soulgem. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "you can now craft spelltomes and scrolls using any of the 5 added scribe lecterns (based on diamok&#39;s scribe lectern, thanks for letting me use it by the way :) ,  and rad666a enchanting scrolls mod)\r<br />\r<br />lecterns are added to windhelm palace of the kings, court wizard&#39;s room, to temple of divines in solitude, college of winterhold arcaneum, castle dour in solitude, and farengar&#39;s room in whiterun dragonsreach\r<br />\r<br />this mod is basically diamok&#39;s mod with scroll crafting recipes from rad666a. \r<br />to use the lectern, you need inkwell and quill\r<br />\r<br />to craft scrolls, you need to know the spells and have perk requirement in the school of the spell you want to make. example: to make a firebolt scroll, you need to know the spell and have the apprentice perk in destruction, and so on.\r<br />you also need a soul gem to match the strength of that spell, and a roll of parchment (renamed from roll of paper)\r<br />\r<br />crafting books have no spell/perk requirement (yet) but you need to have one scroll of the spell and a blank book, which is craftable at the same lectern. \r<br />\r<br />also added: 3 new recipes for making the blank book, using the second ruined book found in dungeons, burned book, and make your own book recipe from a lot of rolls of parchment, instead of finding those ruined/burned books.\r<br />and added craftable roll of parchment, 2 rolls from one firewood (until i update it) at tanning rack.\r<br />\r<br />(there are 2 esp: the scribe lectern.esp gives craftable tomes and scrolls. the craftablescrollscheapversion gives craftable roll of paper. sry for the mixup)\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS: for diamok&#39;s scribes lectern: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16816/?  and rad666a enchanting scrolls mod: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26780/?\r<br />\r<br />version 2 update: added tanning rack recipe for quills, 3 quills made from 1 hagraven or hawk feathers (to match the picture of them), recipe in cooking pot for inkwell made of honey and charcoal (both types), recipe for roll of paper(or parchment) at the lectern, made from both types of ruined books, but not the burned book, because, well, it&#39;s burned. :)\r<br />\r<br />version 3: added lecterns to the jarl&#39;s palace in riften, markarth, and solitude (yes that makes 3 lecterns in solitude, but hey, it&#39;s the capitol, so why not :P).  added it to sunderstone gorge, and hag&#39;s end.\r<br />\r<br />version 5, my last version: no ink and quill required anymore, deleted that script, and no quill and ink recipes. but, books require gems now based on the spell level (novice = petty, master = grand, etc). I did this out of realization of how stupid my other scribing mod is, the ancient spells with necromancy or whatever the hell I named it. honestly, I just had a nostalgia shock for when I started playing skyrim, so I went back to this: no dawnguard or dragonborn required, because I disabled them and wanted to experience the game all over again, standard vanilla. so yeah, no new spells, no oblivion and morrowind spells, no resurrection power, nothing. this is simply all the basic spell tomes and scrolls in the vanilla game made to be crafted. I honestly hope someone else enjoys this mod cause this is it, I&#39;m done modding. it&#39;s best to enjoy the game for what it is :)",
