Just certain perks so they\\'re not OP or anything.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=2CB4BE][u]\\\"Bugs\\\":[/u][/color] [color=84DC85]\r\n-If you decide to do Aedrick\\'s alternate start, for some reason the Jarl won\\'t open his dialogue. There is a bat to fix this problem in the Optional Files\r\n-Elora (Aedrick\\'s companion) actually stands outside of Whiterun when dismissed (by the entrance with the guards). Not sure why but I\\'ll look for better alternatives to this.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=2CB4BE][b][u]Characters[/u][/b][/color]\r\n[IMG]http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a23/creeposaurus/Dragon%20Age%20n%20Games/thumb4.png[/IMG]\r\n[color=455FD4][b][Name] Xandra \r\n[Race/Sex] Nord Female[/b][/color]\r\n[color=F61332]*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*[/color]\r\n[color=F2B035]Just arriving from delivering ores and ingots to Whiterun for her father, Xandra is horrified to discover Helgen in flames\r\n\\\"Gods no!\\\", she cried as she quickly ran to find her parents.\r\n(Story continues in Readme. Hawhaw >:D)[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=F4F15C][b]Note:[/b] This save\\'s a little different. Meaning, it doesn\\'t start in the usual beheading part and you don\\'t exactly get to pick who you follow (doesn\\'t mean you\\'ve sided with Imperials or Stormcloaks yet though). Being the daughter of a blacksmith, she\\'s already able to smith things up to Orcish Armor. It also starts off in front of a ruined house (the inn you jump on in the original way to get to Hadvar. I call it a house now so whatevs). Readme has additional information/instructions for any confusion. Also regular save included (takes place in beheading).[/color]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a23/creeposaurus/Dragon%20Age%20n%20Games/thumb6.png[/IMG]\r\n[color=455FD4][b][Name] Ororo \r\n[Race/Sex] Redguard Female[/b][/color]\r\n[color=F61332]*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*[/color]\r\n[color=F2B035]A feared mage, Ororo (also former captain of the ship \\'Storm of the Abecean\\') and her crew were finally captured by the Penitus Oculatus near the borders of Skyrim. Because of the nature of her crimes and how dangerous she was considered, she was sent to the nearest city to be executed while the rest of her crew were sent to Cyrodiil to face trial. [/color]\r\n\r\n[color=F4F15C][b]Note:[/b] If you get the references here, you are awesome[/color]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a23/creeposaurus/Dragon%20Age%20n%20Games/thumb5.png[/IMG]\r\n[color=455FD4][b][Name] Moira \r\n[Race/Sex] Woodelf(Ohmes Khajiit?) Female[/b][/color]\r\n[color=F61332]*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*[/color]\r\n[color=F2B035] A mysterious traveler caught trading with Stormcloak soldiers as their camp was ambushed, she was instantly branded traitor by Imperial authorities and sentenced to death. Although she appears to be pale skinned Wood Elf, she claims to be one of the fabled Ohmes, even bearing an accent only heard from citizens of Elsweyr. [/color]\r\n\r\n[color=F4F15C][b]Note:[/b] My take on the Ohmes. I\\'ve removed all Wood Elf abilies except Command Animal and gave her the racial abilities Khajiit Claws and Night Eye. Playing with her appearance in the console with probably result in her not have her skin tone anymore.[/color]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a23/creeposaurus/Dragon%20Age%20n%20Games/thumb7.png[/IMG]\r\n[color=455FD4][b][Name] Garrus \r\n[Race/Sex] High Elf Male[/b][/color]\r\n[color=F61332]*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*[/color]\r\n[color=F2B035]Once a soldier of the Thalmor, Garrus was shunned because of relations he had with a Nord woman one drunken night. Figuring it would be wise to dispose of him, the Justicar of his unit had him arrested for treason on claims he was both a spy for the Stormcloaks and a worshipper of Talos.[/color] \r\n\r\n[color=F4F15C]Note: He\\'s handsome. That is all :D[/color]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a23/creeposaurus/Dragon%20Age%20n%20Games/thumb8.png[/IMG]\r\n[color=455FD4][b][Name] Aedrick \r\n[Race/Sex] Wood Elf Male[/b][/color]\r\n[color=F61332]*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*[/color]\r\n[color=F2B035]As he and his companion were hunting outside the wilds near Helgen, they witnessed a massive, black creature fly overhead towards the small village.\r\n\\\"What in Oblivion is that?\\\", his companion cried as they both watched the creature circle overhead before taking a downward plunge into the buildings below.\r\n(Story continues in Readme, don\\'t want this page to become TL;DR)\r\n[/color] \r\n\r\n[color=F4F15C]Note: Another sexy elf may-an, another alternative start file. There is also a regular save that starts at the execution.[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=2CB4BE][u]Mods Used:[/u][/color] [color=84DC85]In each rar I\\'ve included a Readme with a list of mods used so you can get their exact appearance as in the photos. Also so this description wouldn\\'t become TL;DR. I\\'ve also include installation and bat instructions. If there are any issues or you need help, send me a quick pm :)[/color] \r\n\r\n[color=2CB4BE][u]Credits:[/u][/color] [color=84DC85]Thank you Bethseda and awesome modders for letting my imagination run wild :)[/color]",
