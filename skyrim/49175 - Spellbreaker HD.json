  "descriptionHtml": "~FILE FIXED&#33;~\r<br />\r<br />Note: Screenshots taken with Realvision ENB, some colors may appear more or less saturated to you, depending on what you have setup. \r<br />\r<br />After 4 days of toiling and tweaking and redoing, I finally am proud to present this HD retexture of Spellbreaker.  I&#39;ve done spellbreaker before, but that was two years ago and I did not have a HD texture to work with as a base at the time.  \r<br />\r<br />I tried to keep the texture fidelity as high as I could while providing a lovely piece of eye candy. The textures are all in 2048x2048 (except the environment map) though should not cause any slow downs that I am aware of. So, enjoy&#33; \r<br />\r<br />- Will be adding 1024x1024 variant for people with a high-mod count/ lower powered gpu&#39;s. \r<br />\r<br />Without further ado, all you need to do is download and install it, manually or through NMM ( Best option). The textures are fully compatible with Dual Sheathe Redux, they are not compatible with any other mod that changes Spellbreakers textures. \r<br />\r<br />Alternate Bronze version -does not- require the main file, however I reccomend the main file due to the included larger mesh, which shows off the details of this retexture a little better than the default. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />~PLEASE DO NOT UPLOAD THIS ANYWHERE ELSE WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT PERMISSION, THANK YOU~\r<br />\r<br /> ",
