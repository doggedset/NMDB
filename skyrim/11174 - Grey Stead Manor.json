  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=aqua][b]Grey Stead Manor[/b][/color][/center]\r\n[center]v1.3 by NovaCoren[/center]\r\n\r\n[center]A spacious three story manor player home designed for players who are further into the game looking for a large lore friendly player home for all their gear. I\\'ve tried to focus on making it feel like a \\'manor\\' so if your after a small cosy house this probably not the mod your after.
