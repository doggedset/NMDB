  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://armaholic.com/viper/skyrim/jorswordmosaic.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[img]http://armaholic.com/viper/skyrim/descri.png[/img]\r\nThe sword is now standalone and craftable at skyforge, it can be upgraded anywhere, also you can find a blessed version which adds 50 extra damage to dragons at eorlund\\'s skyforge, it\\'s worth every septim. As soon as the creation kit is released and I\\'ve learnt the basics, something bigger will follow, a hint is a whole new quest with something very valuable at the end ;)\r\n___\r\nSo this is my third texture so far, and I worked my arse off on it for hours, each piece is brand new on the original textures except perhaps the guards main texture, only the colour has been changed there. \r\n\r\nThis is a retexture of the blades akaviri sword. The hilt has a scaled design and uses the colours black and green, the blade itself is a normal silver/steel colour with softer edges. It can be crafted only at the skyforge but upgraded anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe sheath keeps the same scaled theme and the hilt has had cross stitching added one by one and made to be syymetrical to some degree, if you zoom in on the pictures themself you can see the amount of detail thats in the texture, the design is of high defintion quality, and is double that of bethesda\\'s default texture size. \r\n\r\nThe sword is called Jormungandr after the norse mythology, Jormungandr is the world serpent that lay in the oceans curled around the world and biting its own tail. Mortal enemy of Thor. Also called the Midgard Serpent.\r\n[img]http://armaholic.com/viper/skyrim/featur.png[/img]\r\nUnique hand-drawn scaled design and uses the colours black and green/lime green, the blade itself is a normal silver/steel colour.\r\n[img]http://armaholic.com/viper/skyrim/installa.png[/img]\r\nJust add the weapons folder supplied to your Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\ folder.\r\n[img]http://armaholic.com/viper/skyrim/additi.png[/img]\r\nThis is my third texture for skyrim. My other two can be found in the skins section of modsaholic downloads. They are simple re-colourations of the original blades sword, though I like the more.\r\n\r\nI took a look at the original bethesda hilt and as you may know it is a curled up dragon, well jormungandr was a curled up dragon under the sea, I may alter the maps of the hilt to be of better quality, but I think it\\'s safe to say, it was written in the stars!\r\n\r\nYou may not alter or redistribute this texture without my permission, neither can you host it without my permission.\r\n\r\nFeel free to rate this mod however you wish, also stop on by [url=http://www.modsaholic.com/index.php?c=news]modsaholic[/url] for all the latest news on 40+ game series, no signing up required. :)\r\n[img]http://armaholic.com/viper/skyrim/chang.png[/img]\r\nv1.1\r\nMade the sword a standalone with esp, sword is craftable and upgradble.\r\n\r\nv1.0\r\nInitial Release\r\n[img]http://armaholic.com/viper/skyrim/creds.png[/img]\r\n[url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/1050456-lateraliss/][b]Lateraliss[/b][/url] for his [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6677]how to add standalone armour tutorial[/url], and also for his constant help walking me through getting this standalone, Thanks man!",
