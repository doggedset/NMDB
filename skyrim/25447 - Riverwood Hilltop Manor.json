  "descriptionHtml": "This 3 story house is settled in the town of Riverwood up on top of the hill.

By the way this is my first Mod so i would appreciate if i could get some advice on anything because im still learning. \r\n=========================================================================================\r\nInstall/Uninstall - I recommend using the Nexus Mod Manager its very easy to use.\r\nIf not then download this file and move the files in this download to your data files in your Skyrim directory or delete them to uninstall.\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nKnown Bugs \r\n\r\n- The Mannequins sometimes change positions or look at each other which is kinda creepy.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersions - \r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\nV1.1 \r\n=========================================================================================\r\n- I have fixed up a few things in this and added some more object and clutter to the house o make it look a bit more interesting.\r\n\r\nV1.2 \r\n=========================================================================================\r\n- I have fixed the Navmesh inside the house so now a follower can come inside of the house with you bust is still a little glitchy and may not want to come with you upstairs. I have added a Personal Guard inside the home just to give the house a little bit more lively. There is also a newly added caravan to the right side of the house which has a merchant which can sell you weapons, armor and crafting equipment. There is also a newly added map marker so you don\\'t have to climb up the hill every time you fast travel to Riverwood.\r\n\r\nV1.3 \r\n=========================================================================================\r\n- In this update all it is is adding in some more things to the house for decoration and fixed the forge.\r\n\r\nV1.4 \r\n=========================================================================================\r\n- This update adds a couple new features to the house like a new pet dog in the house, Added some guards at your front door of the house, More decorations to the house, i have added a bookcase into the house (its still a little glitchy though), the personal guard can now be a follower and i have given the merchant outside of the house some guards. I am trying to fix the mannequins so they work but its not working yet for some strange reason so i will be trying to fix those soon.\r\n\r\nV1.5 \r\n=========================================================================================\r\n- This update fixes the mannequin problem and they now work and i have also added more so now there are a total of 6 mannequins. There are also a couple more weapon display cases i have added in the house. I have also added some bushes and plants out the front of the house and around near the Merchants Cart. \r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nCheck out my other mods\r\nNew and Interesting Followers - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26093",
