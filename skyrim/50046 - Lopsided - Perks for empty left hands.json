  "descriptionHtml": "============\r<br />Lopsided\r<br />============\r<br />A simple perk mod to enable a duelist/fencer playstyle. I envision such a character to be a quick combatant; balanced somewhere between brutal dual wielders, and defensive shield warriors.\r<br />\r<br />The three included perks should only function with a one-handed weapon in the right, and no item equipped in the left.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />============\r<br />Notes\r<br />============\r<br />- Image provided only for flavour\r<br />- Creative credit to Endalis, whose superior imagination inspired this mod. His mod is here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33130\r<br />- Created for my own personal use, with my own thoughts of how such a character should be. I&#39;m new to modding, so no warranties here ;)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />============\r<br />The Perks\r<br />============\r<br />&#34;Balance&#34; (20) - Significantly improves blocking with one handed weapons.\r<br />- Currently balanced at +70% block\r<br />- Should provide a mid-point between vanilla (near useless) 1H blocking, and shield blocking\r<br />- Percentage based on in-game testing. Still nowhere near as effective as a shield (in my own testing)\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Finesse&#34; (30)- +35% attack speed\r<br />- Intended to be similar to the dual flurry perk, it kinda follows that you&#39;d move faster without that heavy shield right?\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Grace&#34; (50)- +20% stamina recovery\r<br />- Intended to offer some compensation for giving up the enchantment on your left hand, similar rationale to the above.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />============\r<br />Change log\r<br />============\r<br />Version 1.1\r<br />- Finesse and Grace both slightly buffed\r<br />- Perk values [70/35/20]\r<br />- No other changes\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.0\r<br />- Perk values [70/30/15]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />============\r<br />Final Thoughts\r<br />============\r<br />I welcome your input, and any bug reports. I would also be very happy to see people try to test whether the perks are appropriately restricted, or whether you can get them to function with non-specified weapon combos.\r<br />\r<br />I hope you like it, all the best ;)",
