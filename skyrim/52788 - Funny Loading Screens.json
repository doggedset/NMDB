  "descriptionHtml": "Now with Screenshots&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Inspired by Toothman&#39;s funny loading screen mod for Oblivion, I decided to create one for Skyrim seeing as no one else did it. \r<br />\r<br />Now, this mod contains humor that not everyone will find funny, for it contains; lame jokes, immature jokes, some swearing, references to things (such as music and tv shows) that only a few understand and a few insults directly to you (not anything too bad). So, if you&#39;re not entertained by that sort of thing, then this mod is not for you and I will not be making a &#39;cleaner&#39; version of this mod.\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t take credit for 100% of the jokes since I did use a few I found across the internet so you may have see one or two of them already.\r<br />\r<br />Installation: I&#39;ts just a single .esp file, just extract it from the .7z file with Winrar, then drag and drop it into your skyrim data file and activate it. Shouldn&#39;t be too much of a challenge.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility: Preferably the latest version of Skyrim, I didn&#39;t used any of the DLC when creating this mod so they are not necessary. \r<br />If you are using a mod that already changes the loading screens, then it may cause some problems.\r<br />\r<br />Bugs: I haven&#39;t completely tested this mod since I created it and wouldn&#39;t find the jokes to be too funny as I wrote most of them.\r<br />This is my first mod for Skyrim so please be nice.",
