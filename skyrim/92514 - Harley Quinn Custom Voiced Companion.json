Her HDT hair doesn't move![/color]\n<br />[color=#38761D][color=#6aa84f]A. Make sure you have the SMP PE path installed properly.[/color]\n<br />[/color][color=#BF9000]Q.

You may want to install [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35303]Female Facial Animations[/url]﻿, and then the teeth mesh from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51602]Fair Skin Complexion[/url]﻿ (in that order).\n<br />[color=#BF9000]Q. Help! She's disappeared![/color]\n<br />A. Go into an interior somewhere. She'll pop up. Sorry. That's the best I can do.\n<br />[/color][color=#BF9000]Q. The voice is annoying.[/color]\n<br />[color=#6aa84f]A. Then don't download it. :3[/color]\n<br />[color=#BF9000]Q. She's not sexy enough![/color]\n<br />[color=#6aa84f]A. If you want, you can use a different Harley follower or make your own \n<br />to replace my follower's looks with the VNPC data tool. Sorry, but I am \n<br />not interesting in making a super skimpy/NSFW Harley mod.\n<br />[/color][color=#BF9000]Q. I tried to talk to her, but was interrupted and now I can't talk to her all.[/color]\n<br />[color=#6aa84f]A. You'll need to load a previous save. Sorry about that. OnO[/color]\n<br />[color=#BF9000]Q. My game crashed![/color]\n<br />[color=#6aa84f]A. Check for any conflicts. Use TES5Edit to check out your load order.
