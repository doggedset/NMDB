  "descriptionHtml": "The Fellowship of the Ring Mod contains the following files:\r\n\r\nThese files add the following characters to Skyrim:\r\n\r\nAragorn.esp\r\nBoromir.esp\r\nGandalf.esp\r\nGimli.esp\r\nGollum.esp\r\nLegolas.esp\r\nFrodo Sam Merry & Pippin.esp\r\n\r\nThe next files allow you to play the game in different ways:\r\n\r\nSam Merry & Pippin.esp - If you want to play has Frodo.\r\n\r\nHalfling Race.esp - Allows you to play has an Halfling, without the followers.\r\n\r\nDwarf.esp - Allows you to play has a Dwarf, without the followers.\r\n\r\nNote: Gimli.esp / Sam Merry & Pippin.esp and Frodo Sam Merry & Pippin.esp still allow you to play either has a Dwarf or an Halfling if you want to.\r\n\r\nDwarf and Halfling races:\r\n\r\nThe Dwarf Race that i\\'ve Updated has:\r\n\r\nSkill Bonus:\r\n                     \r\nSmithing - 10\r\nTwo Handed - 10             \r\nHeavy Armor - 5\r\nEnchanting - 5\r\nSpeech - 5\r\n\r\nSpecials:\r\n\r\nRace Dwarf Smithing Ability: Improves your Smithing by 50% for 60 sec.\r\nRace Orc Berserk: You do double the damage and receive half the\r\ndamage for 60 sec.\r\n\r\nThe Halfling Race that i\\'ve Updated has:\r\n\r\nSkill Bonus:                  \r\n\r\nAlchemy - 10                  \r\nSneak - 5                        \r\nOne Handed - 5\r\nPickpocket - 5\r\nLight Armor - 5\r\nSpeech - 5\r\n\r\nSpecials:\r\n\r\nRace Halfling Alchemy Ability: Improves your Alchemy by 50 % for 60 sec.\r\nRace Wood Elf: 50% Disease and Poison resistance.\r\n\r\nNote: This new update will also allow you to play the female version of these races.\r\n\r\nThis Mod does not had any armor or weapons of the Lord of the Rings because there are already many mods out there that adds these items to the game and most or all of them are craftable in the game; so i think that this adds a more quest feel to this mod if you craft them in the game will you are playing. \r\nI\\'ve tried to make the characters resemble the ones from the movies the best that i could.\r\nAll the gear that they bring is from the world of Skyrim.\r\nI\\'ve tried also to give the characters the clothes and the weapons that could resemble the ones that they had in the movies.\r\n\r\nI will try to update this mod in any way i can if i have the time to do so; and i will also recomend the mods that i think are the ones that make the characters look more like the ones in the movies.\r\nI will update pictures of my characters and writte down the mods that i\\'m using in them.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and i hope you enjoy the mod. \r\n\r\n",
