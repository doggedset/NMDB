His staff is designed like a shield so he will always hold it. It has some good enchantments though. He has his trusty horse Shadowfax which will stay were he leaves him and ignore combat and travel. He currently uses the \\\"Male Old Kindly\\\" voice but I added the \\\"Male Old Grumpy\\\" voice too encase someone wanted to use that one instead. Soon he will have the Ian McKellen Gandalf voice when I am done with it, I also plan on making a version with the voice of John Huston as well, because I really like him as Gandalf too. He was Gandalf in the first Hobbit cartoon and Return of the King...  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xhrzbc_hobbit-1977-part-i_shortfilms#.URwCfcgfta4 .\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n=======\r\nHe and Shadowfax are located at the Mages College.\r\n \r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\n\r\n1. He lives where ever you dismiss him at, so don\\'t forget where you left him!\r\n\r\n2. He has a horse that ignores combat and stays where left and travels and is invulnerable to damage.\r\n\r\n3. His trusty staff is like a shield so he will always carry it and it has good enchantments.\r\n\r\n4. He has a good bit of spells but he shouldn\\'t be to overpowered.\r\n\r\n5. I never heard from the chap who first created his sword \\\"Glamdring the Foe Hammer\\\" so I could not include his sword in the mod, sorry. You should be able to find it pretty easy on the Nexus or Steam.\r\n\r\n6. HE HEALS HIMSELF AND PARTY WHEN HIS HEALTH IS LOW!!!\r\n\r\n7. And yes his hat is included!\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n1. This should work fine with NMM.\r\n2. Manual download- Extract the files to a temporary location. Copy the files to \\\\Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\ or steam steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\n1. Remove what you want in his inventory Then, in data files, Uncheck and delete.\r\nIf you need to delete everything that came with this mod then do this.... examine the contents of the whole mod folder and delete all\r\nthe corresponding files.\r\n2. Or use Nexusmodmanager\r\n\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nShouldn\\'t be incompatible with any other mods that I know as of yet.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nI have not found any yet and I tested it with over 200+ mods. Please let me know if you find any. I also cleaned it with TES5Edit\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n1st release\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n=====\r\n1. Soon he will have the Ian McKellen Gandalf voice when I am done with it, I also plan on making a version with the voice of John Huston as well, because I really like him as Gandalf too. He was \r\n\r\n    Gandalf in the first Hobbit cartoon and Return of the King...  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xhrzbc_hobbit-1977-part-i_shortfilms#.URwCfcgfta4 .\r\n\r\n2. I tried to make him look as much as could to Gandalf from the movie but didn\\'t work out so well. So I made him look more like the one from the cartoon.\r\n\r\n3. I will release this mod on Steam when it is complete.\r\n\r\n4. Also I could use some help making his hat sit a little more higher on his head, and fix the ground part of his hat.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nKnightRangersGuild on Nexus or KnightRangersGuild@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim and the Creation Kit.\r\nThanks to DigitalLion for letting me use his Gandalf hat... http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4198 .\r\n\r\n\r\nTools Used\r\n==========\r\nSkyrim Creation Kit, lot\\'s of coffee and my brilliant imagination. Maybe a little hooch to, he, he, he\r\n\r\nPermissions\r\n===============\r\n\r\nI am not done with this mod yet so do not upload or use in your own mod to another site without my permission dudes! thanks",
