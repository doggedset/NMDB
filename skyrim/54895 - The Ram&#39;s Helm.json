  "descriptionHtml": "The Rams Helm is a replacer mod for Warmaidens. Obviously this means it will get rid of Warmaidens from Whiterun. I&#39;m not making this with any Whiterun altering mods installed, so it may not work with\r<br />anything other than Vanilla Whiterun.So far no conflicts with Hearthfire, Dawnguard, or Dragonborn installed in the game itself. I do not know what mods could make conflicts.\r<br />\r<br />The new update -1.0- contains quite a few updates to the interior and exterior. It also add&#39;s a StrongBox within the Counter in the &#34;Lobby&#34; in the side of the Store. Within are areoun 2K Septims, to be &#34;Store Profits&#34; and a Key for the place if it ever locks. I took out the front entrence entirely and replaced it with a wall on the interior and borded it up on the exterior, also blocked it with a rock heh.. The bedroom was converted to storage, the dining room was converted to the Lobby, and the Crafting Stations remain the same.\r<br />\r<br />--This mod, as far as I can tell, DOES remove Ulfberth War-Bear and Adrianne Avenicci from the game entirely, I&#39;ve only tested this mod twice so I&#39;m 50/50 on that.--\r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />**THIS MOD IS DONE&#33; I LOST A MAJOR UPDATE TOO IT BEFORE I COULD RELEASE IT A WHILE BACK, AND HAVE LOST INTEREST IN COMPLETING THIS MOD. I WILL HOWEVER START A NEW SHOP, THAT WILL NOT BE A REPLACER WHEN ABLE**",
