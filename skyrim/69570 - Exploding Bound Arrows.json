  "summary": "Ever got annoyed of bound arrows piling up and being unable to do anything about them?\r<br />Or just want bound arrows to have just that extra effect to them?",
  "descriptionHtml": "A very simple, and small, mod I&#39;ve created. Mostly for my own wishes but decided to share it.\r<br />\r<br />Basically, bound arrows (shot from a bound bow) will now explode (shock explosion) upon contact of a surface, or actor. The explosion radius itself is actually quite small and will only do 10 extra damage if you hit a living actor. It was more for cosmetic effect and to get rid of annoying misses. (Since you are unable to pick-up bound arrow misses).\r<br />\r<br />Really, this was more to add in that extra punch and fun factor to the bound bow, especially if you already have some great overhauls (such as the Archery Overhaul or Ordinator Perks, which already helps with the Bound Bow&#39;s overall damage).\r<br />\r<br />Quick Note for Archery Overhaul users:\r<br />-The explosion damage is still consider as archery damage in the mod, thusly, it will apply the bleed effect to a target who was only hit by the explosion (not by the arrow itself). Meaning, you can apply this bleed effect to two or more possible targets with one arrow, if you get a good shot. (Mind you, the explosion&#39;s damage radius is still rather small).",
