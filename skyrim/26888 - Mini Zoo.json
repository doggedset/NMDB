  "descriptionHtml": "Grilli&#39;s Mini Zoo v1.5\r<br />\r<br />I do not know, if there is another mod like this, but i had the idea for a zoo in skyrim.\r<br />It is only a house with creatures. it makes no sense, but a lot of fun.\r<br />inside you&#39;ll meet some &#39;old friends&#39; who have a look what&#39;s going on.\r<br />the creatures inside are shrinked and made unagressive by &#39;magic&#39;.\r<br />\r<br />the location is near whitewatch tower south east along the road about 300 meters.\r<br />i do not know, if there are other mods at this location, but i think it&#39;s a good place.\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]1-LJ8mKfDo8[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />MANY THANKS TO &#39;BRODUAL&#39;, WHO SENT ME THIS GREAT VIDEO &#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />notes\r<br />\r<br />i tested the mod in an english and german version of skyrim, with and without dawnguard and hearthfire, and all runs fine. sometimes when i zapped through too much savegames, the people in the zoo disappeared. if you have this problem too, only restart the game and all runs fine. (this mod needs a lot of ram, if you have 4gb or less, i can not say if it runs stable).\r<br />and please hold your updates of skyrim at the latest state to avoid crashes.\r<br />\r<br />i cleaned this mod with tes5edit to prevent problems.\r<br />i do not know, if there are conflicts with other mods. please tell me if you find some.\r<br />this mod is now tested with hearthfire and i think it runs correct &#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE INSTALL THE MAIN FILE FIRST &#33;&#33;&#33; THEN OVERWRITE WITH OPTIONAL ONE IF YOU PLAY THE GERMAN OR DRAGONLESS VERSION. THE ARCHIVE AND DARKFACES FIX IS NOT INCLUDED IN OPTIONAL VERSIONS, ONLY THE ESP FILE &#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />if you have any problems with this mod, please make a post.\r<br />if you like it, make a post too.\r<br />thanks a lot.\r<br />\r<br />INCOMPATIBLE MODS:\r<br />\r<br />The zoo from this mod is on the exact same place as the Dwarven Parking from the Dwarven Automobiles mod, which breaks both of the mods.\r<br />(posted by &#34;samcrabchan&#34;)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />LATEST VERSION 1.5\r<br />many of you want to buy souveniers at the zoo.\r<br />here they are. i made 31 jars with creatures, animals and stuff.\r<br />you can buy them from merchant belethor in the zoo.\r<br />the jars are a bit smaller than the originals in game, so they fit better in bookshelves.\r<br />( if you have &#39;unlimited bookshelves&#39; mod installed )\r<br />the souveniers are not cheap&#33; my zoo needs the gold. :)\r<br />(deutsche version unter &#39;optional files&#39;. bitte erst die hauptversion runterladen, dann mit deutscher version Ã¼berschreiben&#33;)\r<br />so have fun with lots of new things for your home&#33;\r<br />\r<br />VERSION 1.4\r<br />- no zoo without an aquarium\r<br />- added a second room with fish\r<br />  (no masterpiece in architecture, i know)\r<br />- very simple made and without lots of stuff\r<br />\r<br />VERSION 1.3\r<br />- some small fixes\r<br />- when i played last time, merchants left their position. hope they stay now\r<br />  at the correct place.\r<br />- set the starting point a bit more far from the zoo\r<br />- file comes with dragons. i add a &#39;dragonless&#39; to optional files\r<br />\r<br />VERSION v1.2\r<br />- for all of you, who think there are too much people inside, be happy now.\r<br />- rush hour is from 12:00 to 22:00.\r<br />- at 22:00 i send the children to bed for 7 hours.\r<br />- at 6:00 most of the old ones go for 6 hours.\r<br />- the best time to have a look is from 6:00 to 12:00.\r<br />- the bedroom is locked and there is no key for you&#33;\r<br />\r<br />(for the &#39;darkfaces bug&#39;: inside the zip-file there are\r<br />two directories, &#39;data/meshes and data/textures. put them to your data directory. nothing will be removed from your files. this are only the &#39;face tint colour&#39; files.)\r<br />these files are only included in the mainfile. so install this first and then an optional file version, if you play the german or dragonless mod.\r<br />have a nice day in zoo.\r<br />\r<br />grilli",
