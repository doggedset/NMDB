  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a new playable race to Skyrim, a mannequin.\r\n\r\nMannequins have always held your weapons and worn your armor so they have become very skilled warriors. They can use any type of weapon and wear either type of armor. They are able to disguise themselves to appear as their enemies and walk right past them. Because they are not human, they do not get diseases, poisoned, and they can stay underwater as long as they like.\r\n\r\nSkills & Power/Abilities\r\n\r\nOne-handed    +10\r\n\r\nTwo-handed    +5\r\n\r\nBlock              +5\r\n\r\nHeavy Armor   +5\r\n\r\nLight Armor    +5\r\n\r\nArchery          +5\r\n\r\nPower- Masquerade. The player becomes disguised to look like the enemy and stop them from attacking for 60 seconds.\r\n\r\nAbilities- 100% resistance to poison and diseases and can breathe underwater\r\n\r\nNew version 1.1:\r\nI changed the disease immunity from 100% to 99%. You probably won't get any diseases from bears or anything like that but you should be able to become a vampire for Dawnguard. Leave a comment if there are still problems.\r\n\r\n*Credit for the idea of the mannequins power/abilities goes to my friend Sean(RadioactiveToaster)",
