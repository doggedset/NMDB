  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b][color=#00ff00]THIS NOT-FOR PROFIT MOD CAN BE DOWNLOADED AND USED FREE OF CHARGE[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/FEKlFMa.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br /> \r<br />Prior to his execution, Roggvir was a guard assigned to watch over Solitude&#39;s main gate, and thus held considerable responsibility to ensure that the city is secured against all possible intrusions and to trap escaping troublemakers seeking to flee.\r<br /> \r<br />However, Roggvir was a Nord, and thus held a fierce sense of pride for his people. Furthermore, he saw Ulfric Stormcloak as a better ruler of Skyrim than the High King Torygg, and his convictions were further hardened when the Aldmeri Dominion, having been defeated by the Empire but with the White-Gold Concordat in exchange for an uneasy peace, sought to suppress any form of Talos worship. To Roggvir, he saw it as a complete travesity, a convenient excuse by the Aldmeri to destroy any dissent against its domination of all Tamriel.\r<br /> \r<br />In addition to his outward duties as a gate guard, and as a reward for his secret loyalty to the Jarl, Roggvir was given The Lucky Skeever, secretly owned by the Jarl of Windhelm as one of his several assets across the province, and used it as his residence when staying in the city and lying low. \r<br /> \r<br />Now as you enter the city for the first time, you quickly become witness to Roggvir&#39;s execution, all eyes on him as the axe is raised over his head... Not knowing later that you would realize that even dead men can speak, and to obtain the key means that you must conduct an investigation around the seized property.\r<br /> \r<br />[center][youtube]A4kqAvQh_1E[/youtube][youtube]BcqZOEciKbE[/youtube][/center]\r<br />Preview Video by izon87604\r<br />\r<br />[b]Features[/b]\r<br />[list][*]Double bed, plus two beds for followers\r<br />[*]Kitchenette with proper storage of meat, vegetables and spirits\r<br />[*]Personal work desk (includes library, alchemy lab and enchanting table)\r<br />[*]Convenient access to Solitude&#39;s trade district\r<br />[*]Weapon racks and display mannequins\r<br />[*]Balcony with a good view of the city\r<br />[*]A garden for vegetables and medicinal herbs\r<br />[*]Small heated bathroom\r<br />[*]Extensive storage options\r<br />[*]Bookshelves and mannequins for collectors\r<br />[*]Can be used as a secondary home for two followers (using My Home is Your Home)\r<br />[*]Navmeshed\r<br />[*]Cleaned with TES5edit\r<br />[*][s][b]Script-Free[/b] -- no fancy tricks such as light switches or autosorts.[/s]\r<br />[*]No god items included\r<br />[*](NEW) Basement area (or as one player appropriately put it, a [b]Mancave[/b]) for all types of crafting activities and further storage\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[b]Note:[/b] Depending on whom I ask, the cushy sofa sets (from what I studied, in real life some of them have evolved from Greek and Roman recliners, and men of those times would use them at leisure) could either be an anachronism or not, but what is important is tremendous comfort at the end of the day, especially weary adventurers who journeyed miles across rugged countryside and mountains.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Note #2:[/b] This house is intended for single/unmarried player characters, as it&#39;s not been fixed to be used by married couples.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Foreign Language Support / Translations[/b] (Translations are OK, just tell me first&#33;)\r<br />[list][*][url=http://tamsanpo.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-137.html]Japanese (日本)[/url]\r<br />[*][url=http://gamer-mods.ru/load/mody_dlja_skyrim/doma_i_lokacii/vezuchij_zlokrys_v1_24_the_lucky_skeever_of_silitude/15-1-0-2428]Russian[/url] (by STrickenWarior)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[b]Installation[/b]\r<br /> \r<br />NMM: simply install the mod.\r<br />MO: simply install the mod.\r<br />Manual: open the downloaded file with 7zip, and then click and drag the .ESP into Skyrim&#39;s Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#cc0000]Compatibility Issues[/color][/b]\r<br />[list][*][size=2][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58055][b]JK&#39;s Solitude[/b][/url] -- part of this mod alters the narrow alleyway behind the tavern and the cul-de-sac emplaced with a shed, as well as it uses its own navmesh implementation.
