Tired to see guards slaying unique NPCs for no reason? The mod provides you the ability to resolve accidental conflicts in immersive way.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Note:[/b] Resolving conflicts between Factions (like Stormcloaks vs Imperial Legion) is outside of the scope of this mod\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]MU1s6VoJi9U[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[u]How to recieve the perk?[/u]\r<br />1) Use the Shrine of Stendarr\r<br />2) The console way:\r<br />[b]help Peacekeeper\r<br />player.addperk IdYouSee[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[u]How to use?[/u]\r<br />Activate the fighing character and use the [b]Negotiate[/b] option\r<br />\r<br />[u]What conflicts can be resolved?[/u]\r<br />(In all the conflicts the player himself must not be a target)\r<br />- Between any follower and a random character\r<br />- Between any friend and a random character\r<br />- Between any non-warrior (merchant, farmer, blacksmith, etc) and a random character\r<br />- You MUST know the character. You must talk with him at least once in the game or you won&#39;t be able to negotiate.\r<br />- You won&#39;t be able to negotiate if you performed a violent crime against the faction to which this person belongs.\r<br />\r<br />For example, you can&#39;t resolve a conflict between two warriors that are not your friends, but you can negotiate farmers with the same relationship rank.\r<br />\r<br />[u]What affects the chance of resolving the conflict?[/u]\r<br />- Relationship rank. If one of the fighters is your ally or friend, the chance is higher\r<br />- If the character have a family or friends, the chance is higher\r<br />- The speechcraft of the player, the character and the opponent. The skill difference matters.\r<br />- The way you approach the person. Angle matters a lot. Better to negotiate face to face\r<br />\r<br />Resolving conflicts between followers is easy.\r<br />Resolving conflicts between random characters is much harder.\r<br />Resolving conflicts between guards and followers are nearly impossible (such problems should be addressed at the very beginning)",
