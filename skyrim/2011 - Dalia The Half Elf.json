  "descriptionHtml": "Wood Elf with Imperial features (Nose and Eye shape) and blue eyes, making her look closer to Lord of The Rings lore. No Mods Required for eyes.\r\n\r\nUsing the showracemenu I created Dalia, a Half Elf, her benefits are Wood Elven as is the race she is considered throughout the game. If edited in showracemenu she reverts her eyes back to default Wood-elf as does her hair, making it unable to edit her in that manner.\r\n\r\nShe starts in Riverwood, with only clothes and an iron dagger, having made her living out on small work like knitting and growing crops, she sold all she owned, now wanting to adventure and find homage in lands more exciting, so she ventured North to skyrim, making it to Riverwood by carriage, she starts her journey.",
