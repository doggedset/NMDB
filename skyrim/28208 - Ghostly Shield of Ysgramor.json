  "summary": "Just a simple retex to make it look like the ghostly weapons",
  "descriptionHtml": "Well, not really a RETEX per se, I just changed attributes of the original mesh and instead of the common texture, I linked the \\\"_n\\\" texture, like the ghostly weapons also do.\r\n\r\nI did that to use with this mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7898 - Ethereal Shields beta\r\nThe author used the glass shield model to make a shield without armor rating, so mages could use one and still keep the mage armor bonus.\r\n\r\nThing is, the Glass Shield, as nice as it looks, still looks bulky for a mage, so I remembered \\\"what about the ghostly weapons? I\\'m sure there is a ghostly shield, since I didn\\'t explore every corner of the game yet!\\\"\r\nAnd there wasn\\'t. There wasn\\'t even an \\\"ancient nordic shield\\\". So, I made this and changed the directories in the esp, pointing to the right files. :p\r\n\r\nJust a side-note: You can use it as a replacement, since it uses vanilla meshes and textures. Just put it in the folder of the shield you want to replace and rename correctly, like \\\"Data\\\\meshes\\\\armor\\\\shieldofysgramor\\\\shieldofysgramor.nif\\\" [mine is called ghostlyshieldofysgramor.nif]\r\n\r\nEdit: The whole purpose of this mod got surpassed by two things. One, the fact that using a shield doesn\\'t count as wearing armor, thus not affecting the mage armor perk. And two, the mod Staves of Skyrim [ http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22691 ] is a MUCH BETTER solution to the whole mage and shield problem. Check it before you make any assumptions!",
