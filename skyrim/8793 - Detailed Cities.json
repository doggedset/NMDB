Detailed Cities primarily uses assets already in the scene to have as little effect on load times as possible, that being said I will use assests if they fit into the scene well.\r\n\r\nWorks extremely well with \\\"High Res Texture Pack DLC\\\". Other objects will be added to the Capital Cities eg, chairs, barrels, chests, food, plates etc etc. There are plans for NPCs to be added once the city changes have been made if i feel there is a need for them.\r\n\r\nI will not be adding “Pines” to Whiterun as there is already a mod for that and geographically it doesn’t suit. In other cities it will and all foliage will be changed accordingly.\r\n\r\nUploaded to Skyrim Nexus. http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8793 (By request)\r\n\r\n################ Next Update ################\r\n\r\n- Now that the larger cities are mostly done I will be working on the smaller towns and adding / polishing things that have bugged me, if you have any suggestions at about the mod please let them below and they might get into the next patch.\r\n\r\n- With \\\"Open Cities\\\" now including Whiterun and fixing other bugs the next Patch will work on making Detailed Cities compatible with Open Cities (This might kill your frame rate, depending on how things go i might release a seperate mod for Open Cities compatibility).\r\n\r\n- Adding city lights to unnaturally dark areas of the cities (If you have a lighting mod it might have already fixed this).\r\n\r\n- More to come.\r\n\r\n################ Mod Currently Includes ################\r\n\r\nWhiterun: (100% Complete)\r\n- Over 600 extra objects of detail from trees. flowers, crates, chairs, barrels, rugs, and more added to the all Districts.
