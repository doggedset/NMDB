  "descriptionHtml": "[b][i][u]VERSION 0.04[/u][/i][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Added a dining room and kitchen, and improved the lighting throughout.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][i]VERSION 0.03[/i][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Made some tweaks to the chapel and started working on the paths leading to new rooms and such.\r<br />[b][i][u]\r<br />VERSION 1,02\r<br />[/u][/i][/b]\r<br />The chapel has been finished, I&#39;m rather happy with it. There&#39;s furniture, decorations and lighting. If anybody&#39;s wondering why I have a gargoyle sitting above a statue of mara it&#39;s because they are historically creatures of protection, they&#39;re not evil or malicious.\r<br />\r<br />EDIT: Oooops, Now with added chandelliers&#33; XD\r<br />[b][i][u]\r<br />VERSION 0.01[/u][/i][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Uploaded the Chapel, but it&#39;s not finished yet, it still needs furniture and decorations etc. Please take a look and let me know if you have any suggestions for or issues with the mod. To get to the cell, open up the console and type coc &#34;Forgotten temple&#34;\r<br />\r<br />[center]*      *      *[/center]\r<br />It&#39;s been a long time since I decided to refurbish castle volkihar, only to have to stop because it kept causing CTDs no matter how careful I was.\r<br />\r<br />I spent 12 hours making a chapel and had to get rid of it, and people who were looking forward to that mod wanted to know if I had plans to make the chapel a separate room of some kind, and I have finally decided to do so.\r<br />\r<br />The first step will be rebuilding the chapel, which will take some time, especially as i am more busy these days, but I will be uploading step by step so people can beta test this with me.\r<br />\r<br />The plan is to make a lengthy labyrinthine temple, with the chapel as its heart. If people want it to have NPCs and quests and such, then I will need a modder with coding experience to work with me, else it&#39;s gonna be empty save for many deadly traps.\r<br />\r<br />For now, the file is stage 0.0 and has nothing in it, I just wanted to create this page. It requires all three expansions because i don&#39;t want to be limited in what i can add, so apologies if this is an issue for people.",
