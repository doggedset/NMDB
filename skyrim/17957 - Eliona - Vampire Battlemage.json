Play any difficulty.\r\n1. Sneak a lot if you don\\'t want to use summons. Use Detect Life and Night vision at Night and in Caves. \r\n2. Use the dagger to instantly kill most enemies. \r\n3. Weaker enemies can be attacked with dual Dawnbreakers or Destruction Magic.\r\n4. Stronger enemies can be dispatched using dual-cast Lightning Bolt quickly, even Ancient and Elder (named) Dragons on Expert. This is especially useful in combination with the Dragonrend shout.\r\n5. If you don\\'t like sneaking, dual conjure a couple of dremora lords or raise the dead with \\\"Dead Thrall\\\" permanently or \\\"Dread Zombie\\\" for temporary allies. Any kind of summon is great when fighting more than one opponent. You can also use the frost shout or unrelenting force for some breathing space.\r\n6. Use Kyrns Peace when attacked by wild beats (saber cats, bears) and sooth them. Unless you want to fight.\r\n7. Don\\'t forget to cast Ironskin before a fight\r\n8. You can feed in most cities, Temple in Whiterun if you don\\'t mind feeding of the sick. Thief\\'s Guild in Riften, College in Winterhold, Sanctuary of the Dark Brotherhood and many other places.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\n1. Extract the file using 7zip\r\n2. Place the file in your My Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Saves Folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave Fun! Took me a while to get there :-)\r\n",
