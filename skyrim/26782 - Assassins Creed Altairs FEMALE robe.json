  "descriptionHtml": "This is Altairs Assasin\\\\\\'s Creed Robe for FEMALES becuase I got a requests on my Altair robe mod that people wanted a female version, so here it is.\r\n\r\nIt includes red trim from sides, (Not front and back like Altair\\\\\\'s, wanted variety) The actual Assassin\\\\\\'s Creed Belt Buckle seen in the games, and belts, straps etc.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy! \r\n\r\nREPLACE MY TEXTURE WITH THE FEMALE EXPERT ROBES IN YOUR GAME. They are known as \\\\\\'Magejourneymans\\\\\\' robes. I have already put a backup DDS file in the mod so you can install safely :D Just rename it \\\\\\'robes\\\\\\' in the magejourneyman robes folder. \r\n\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nOlaffsen",
