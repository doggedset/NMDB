  "descriptionHtml": "A simple resource for anyone that wants a variety of coins in game. \r\nI\\'m not much of a texturer but I have learned a thing or two from my graphics class. I hope you find what your looking for with these coins.\r\n\r\n-Both coins have appropriate colors and custom icons on them that are lore friendly.\r\n-Both coins appear shinier in game\r\n\r\nPermissions:\r\nFeel free to re-texture any way you like. These can be used in any way for any mod. If you\\'d like to translate or upload to another site be my guest. Just give me credit for the work if you use this resource thank you.\r\n\r\nHow to use:\r\n\r\nSimply create a new Misc or Static Object and use the provided meshes in Data/Meshes/Clutter folder. they should be named \\\"coppercoin01\\\" and \\\"silvercoin01\\\"\r\n-Misc objects can be picked up vs Static objects.\r\n\r\nHappy modding!",
