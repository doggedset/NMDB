  "descriptionHtml": "[u]Apocrypha - The Library of Forbidden Knowledge[/u]\r\n\r\n[color=green]v0.6 - Updated 26/05/2013 - removed wooden shelves, and replaced with books at right angles to create artificial shelving that keeps the feeling that books are stuffed into every nook and cranny (and also looks better when tiled on ceilings) but still gives a feeling of accessibility. I feel that this strikes the best balance according to my own tastes.[/color]\r\n\r\nI\\'ve also played around with the normal maps, hopefully it looks better and has a little more depth now.\r\n\r\nAccording to lore, Apocrypha is \\\"an endless library, shelves stretching on in every direction, stacks on top of stacks.\\\"  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in-game, I feel that the walls of books are a pixellated mess.\r\n\r\nThis first release includes new textures with bookshelves containing books along the walls (and ceilings), and upscales (bicubic smoothing) the fish-man statue textures.\r\n\r\nThe textures themselves are based on \\\"Buchregal mit Musikschriften\\\" by Giuseppe Maria Crespi in a form that has been heavily edited by myself - the original image is in the public domain and there are no copyright issues with using the original image.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u]Technical details:[/u]\r\n\r\nHD retexture of Apocrypha book walls and statues available in 2048 or 4096 resolution.  Performance will depend on your graphics card, but as Apocrypha is internal cells, the performance hit will be less than most high resolution mods.\r\n\r\n[u]Known issues:[/u] \r\n\r\n- Textures may not be optimized for best performance, but I don\\'t see any frame rate hit on my own system.\r\n- As with all retextures, the visuals may not be to everyone\\'s taste - the walls differ quite radically fro the original textures, while (I believe) still remaining lore-friendly.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u]Installation:[/u]\r\nDragonborn is required to use this mod (obviously!)\r\nTextures provided in bsa format for easier installation and uninstallation.\r\nUse NMM to install, or place the esp and bsa file into your data directory.",
