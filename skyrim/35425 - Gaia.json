  "descriptionHtml": "*REQUIRES DAWNGUARD*\r\n\r\nI thought Skyrim could use more variety when it comes to animal companions. That sentiment mixed with browsing UESP and being curious with about the CK, this was born.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing the Vale Deer and Vale Sabrecat on UESP, I noticed no one had made any mods making them followers.I decided this would be the perfect chance to start modding.\r\n\r\nGaia, the friendly Vale Deer can be found near the Guardian stones and returns there when dismissed. She isn\\'t overly powerful, and tends to stop fighting for a moment to yell, but that\\'s in the deer combat behavior.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to DARKF0X127 on youtube for making an easy to follow tutorial video on making animal followers via the CK. :D\r\n",
