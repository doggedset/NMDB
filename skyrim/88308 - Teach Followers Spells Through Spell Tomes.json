Why?\n<br />A: There are several reasons why.\n<br />[/size][list=1]\n<br />[*][size=3]Your follower doesn't have enough magicka to cast the spell.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Your follower doesn't have high enough skill in that school of magic to cast the spell. (Example: Followers need a skill of 50 in destruction to cast Fireball)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]The AI of your follower doesn't see the spell as useful in combat.[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]\n<br />Q: Will this work for custom followers or followers that don't use the normal follower system?\n<br />A: Yes, it should.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Why does the option appear for NPCs that temporarily follow me during certain quests?\n<br />A: So the option appears for followers that don't use the normal follower system. There's not much I can do to avoid this.\n<br />[/size]",
