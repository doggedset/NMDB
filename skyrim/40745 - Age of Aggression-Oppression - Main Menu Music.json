  "descriptionHtml": "This file is a music replacement for the vanilla main menu music.\r\nThe song is an epic Age of Aggression/ Oppression /Elder Scrolls main theme mixup\r\ncreated by the wonderfully talented Advait Nemlekar. Links to his shtuff:\r\n\r\nThe Song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5Ib62x5ReY\r\n\r\nHis Profile: www.youtube.com/advaitnemlekar\r\n\r\nHis SoundCloud Profile: https://soundcloud.com/advaitnemlekar\r\n\r\nHe has graciously given me permission to post his song on the nexus for others and I am giving him full credit for the song, all I did was a little leg-work to get it ready for the wonderful Nexus haha.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\nInstallation is a piece o\\' cake, all you have to do is:\r\n1. Download the .xwm file and unzip it\r\n( make sure that the files final name is either mus_maintheme or mus_maintheme.xwm )\r\n2. Go to your main Skyrim folder\r\n ( for me its under local disk (C:)\\\\program files\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim )\r\n3. Under the \\'Data\\' folder open the \\'Music\\' folder\r\n ( it should already be there, but if it isn\\'t just create it )\r\n4. While in the \\'Music\\' folder create a new folder and name it \\'Special\\'\r\n( just make sure you dont use the \\'     \\' apostrophes )\r\n5. Drop the downloaded .xwm file straight into the folder\r\n6. You\\'re done! Hopefully it\\'s workin for ya!\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDED:\r\nNot truly important but in my personal opinion this music is PERFECT with oomnine\\'s \\\"Civil War Themed Main Menu\\\" mod.\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25084//?\r\n\r\nCONFLICTS:\r\nNone known, unless you\\'re trying to use multiple files for the main music and then... I have no idea how it would react.\r\n\r\nPS! Feel free to post a comment or two! I\\'d love to hear everyone\\'s opinions on any other music they\\'d like for the main menu (as in an entirely different song), what main menu images you\\'re using, if you\\'re illiterate and have trouble downloading and setting up as a result :P , anything!\r\n\r\nPSS! Thanks to Kevinsterable for graciously providing me with a NMM version of the file.\r\ncheck out his page: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3622113/?   if anything goes wrong with the NMM feel free to yell at him instead of me! :D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
