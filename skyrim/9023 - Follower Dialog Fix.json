  "summary": "All followers have new dialog options, Housecarls no longer complain about \\\"being sworn to carry your burdens\\\" unless you actually tell them to carry something, otherwise you say your giving them gear and they just trade. Housecarls complain less when they witness you steal. Other NPC acknowledge your Housecarl more. Dismissing a follower sounds ",
  "descriptionHtml": "The final version of this mod was in in response to Felicia Day\\'s post on YouTube that HouseCarl are rude. http://youtu.be/f08wubI6N9o Which I saw posted on G+. This version of the mod is also available in STEAM workshop. \r\n\r\n(Even though I think she plays it on XBOX. It doesn\\'t mean she didn\\'t have a point)\r\n\r\nIn this mod, all followers have new dialog options, Housecarls no longer complain about \\\"being sworn to carry your burdens\\\" unless you actually tell them to carry something, otherwise you say your giving them gear and they just trade. Housecarls complain less when they witness you steal. Other NPC acknowledge your Housecarl more like in Markarth mines you can tell them your married or that someone is waiting for you. Dismissing a follower sounds less permanent now.\r\n\r\nMostly modifies the player dialog slightly to IMO make the common Housecarl lines make more sense but adds some dialog too. This is my first mod, but one that made Housecarls especially much more realistic for me without removing thier quips entirely. But many people are already doing great mods adding much of the other additions I\\'d intended for this mod. So this will be the last version of this MOD I post.\r\n\r\nAlso included as an optional mod in the ZIP file is FredZep\\'s Housecarl mod. But there are no dependencies between his mod an mine.\r\n\r\nHis mod has some aesthetic housecarl tweaks. Makes female housecarls walk like women instead of like men. All Housecarls wear zero armor rating clothes by default. Males wear a thieves guild armor variant with no armor rating. Female Housecarls wear tavern outfits. Totally optional to use it, it\\'s a totally separate ESP.\r\n",
