  "summary": "Learn new words of power by studying the draconic language and spending a few extra dragon souls.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b][color=orange]1. Description[/color][/b]\r\nThis is a simple mod that adds a special book you can study to learn new words of power at the expense of Dragon Souls. There are also optional plugins to add extra books for shouts added in the official DLC.\r\n\r\nIf you like this mod, you might be interested in my other mods: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24445]SPERG[/url] and [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36759]NoDisarm[/url]. This was originally intended to be a perk for SPERG, but I decided it makes a better standalone mod than it does a perk.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]2. Installation[/color][/b]\r\nExtract CunningLinguist.esp and CunningLinguist.bsa into your Data directory. If you have the official DLC, extract CunningLinguistDG.esp and/or CunningLinguistDB.esp as well. To uninstall, simply remove these files.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]3. How It Works[/color][/b]\r\nOnce you\\'ve found a book, you simply read it from your inventory to trigger the study menu. For the main book, this is a list of all the words you\\'re currently capable of learning. The DLC books only teach words from one shout each.\r\n\r\nThe cost of learning a word starts at 3 souls and doubles for each word in the same shout that you study. Learning a word from a quest or a word wall does not impact this cost, so the first word you study will always cost 3 souls, even if it\\'s the third word for that shout. Learning all of the words for a shout costs a total of 21 souls: 3 for the first word, 6 for the second, and 12 for the third. Costs are determined separately for each shout, so even if you\\'ve learned 25 different words from studying, the first word you study for a new shout will still cost only 3 souls.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]4. Shout List[/color][/b]\r\nNot all shouts can be learned through studying. You can only learn words that are not part of the main plot, and shouts which are learned entirely on a single wall have also been omitted. Studying isn\\'t intended to completely replace discovering word walls. It\\'s a supplemental method for using extra dragon souls to earn new words without clearing 50 different dungeons. The complete list of available shouts is below.\r\n\r\n[b][color=yellow]Skyrim Shouts (14 total)[/color][/b]\r\nAnimal Allegiance\r\nAura Whisper\r\nBecome Ethereal\r\nDisarm\r\nDismay\r\nElemental Fury\r\nFire Breath (max. 2 words)\r\nFrost Breath\r\nIce Form\r\nKyne\\'s Peace\r\nMarked For Death\r\nSlow Time\r\nStorm Call\r\nWhirlwind Sprint (second and third words only)\r\n\r\n[b][color=yellow]DLC Shouts (3 total)[/color][/b]\r\nCyclone (Dragonborn)\r\nDragon Aspect (Dragonborn)\r\nDrain Vitality (Dawnguard)\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]5. Book Locations[/color][/b]\r\nBooks have been added to appropriate loot lists, so you will eventually find them just from exploring. There is also one copy of each book placed physically in the world to make sure you can always get at least one copy of the book with relative ease. These books are \\'hiding in plain sight\\', so you won\\'t have to look inside of empty cauldrons to find the book, but it\\'s not going to stick out, either.\r\n\r\nIf you just want to skip right to learning words, you can use the console to add any or all of the books to your inventory. Use the help command to find their IDs, or complete their FormIDs below with their position in your load order.\r\n\r\nOriginal Game Shouts: \\\"Ancient Draconic Lore\\\" (**002DED) found in the Winterhold College Arcanaeum\r\nDrain Vitality: \\\"Draconic Myths & Legends\\\" (*000800) found in Volkihar Keep\r\nCyclone: \\\"History of the Draconic Language\\\" (**000800) found in Severin Manor\r\nDragon Aspect: \\\"Draconic Apocrypha\\\" (**0036D0) found in Raven Rock\\'s Temple\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]6. Mod Compatibility[/color][/b]\r\nThis mod does not edit any existing items, so there shouldn\\'t be any conflicts. Books are added to leveled lists through a script, so a merged patch isn\\'t necessary.\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]7. Known Issues[/color][/b]\r\nApproaching a wall that would teach you a word you\\'ve already studied can rarely have some minor unusual effects. For example, the word found in Arcwind Point continues glowing even though it doesn\\'t have a word to teach you.",
