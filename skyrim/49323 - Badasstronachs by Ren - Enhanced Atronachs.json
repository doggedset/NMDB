  "summary": "A visual enhanced of the 3 summonable Atronachs, altering textures and models for a more immersive experience.\r<br />More magma-like Flame, Translucent Ice and More Electric Storm Atronach.\r<br />Optional File for resizing them to epic proportions&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "I wasn&#39;t happy with the original Atronach appereances, so decided to edit the modules and textures to make them look more elemental and intense.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Flame Atronach[/color]\r<br />Made the flames more intense as the vanilla one, I thought, was too orange and not realistic enough.\r<br />Edited the texture so it feels more like it&#39;s magma and not gray anymore. \r<br />Redid her face so its more vivid while maintaining female attributes.\r<br />\r<br />[color=teal]Frost Atronach[/color]\r<br />Some of you might not like my version of my Frost Atronach cause it loses its parallax attribute, but I spent hours editing his textures to make it more crystal like and icey and adding transparency where I saw fit. It makes him look totally different to the original and other mods.\r<br />\r<br />[color=purple]Storm Atronach[/color]\r<br />I really hated the clouds emanating from his body so I edited his model and changed to additional lightning. \r<br />Changed his texture glow map to be more noticeable and changed the color to purple. \r<br />Texture now shows more realstic moss and more realistic rocks under light.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Do notice that Atronach appereances will vary greatly due to lighting (which I think is fun) so I suggest comparing the changes during the day. \r<br />\r<br />Compatibility\r<br />\r<br />It will work with other mods that do not edit Atronach models or textures cause it will replace most of the files.\r<br />\r<br />Optional Files\r<br />\r<br />Massive Atronachs:\r<br />Will resize the atronach to the according sizes: Flame x 2, Frost and Storm x 3. This affects ALL summonable Atronachs and also wild Atronachs found in the world.\r<br />[right][url=http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC575SRgFG-lWvJ-KNBIjYHg/videos][img]http://imgur.com/5H2j1bF.png[/img][/url][/right]\r<br />                        ",
