  "modName": "HD Dragon Mage Robes - DELETED",
  "summary": "HD robes with likeness of Alduin or Paarthurnax, Thu'um, and a nice enchantment to go with it. Black/green or brown color scheme.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The Dragonborn's back is something I see a lot when playing Skyrim, so I wanted to at least change the sights a bit - without going too fancy, after all he's just a travelling mage. I ended up making these and thought I'd share.\n<br />\n<br />[b]What exactly does this mod add?[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Simple robes with a generic dragon and a few words in Thu'um on the front, and head of Alduin or Paarthurnax on the back, plus slight shading of sleeves and bottom of the robe. Both versions available in two color schemes. HD textures (2048x2048).\n<br />\n<br />The inscription roughly translates into [i]I will be your doom[/i], probably meant as a warning for encountered dragons. My Dragonborn is sick of fighting those pesky lizards.\n<br />\n<br />[b]What are the enchantments?[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Alduin:\n<br />Regenerate Magicka 75%, Fortify Shout Cooldown 20%, Fortify Destruction 30%, Fortify Restoration 10%.\n<br />\n<br />Paarthurnax:\n<br />Regenerate Magicka 75%, Fortify Shout Cooldown 40%[color=#00ffff]*[/color], Fortify Alteration 10%, Fortify Conjuration 10%.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Where to get them?[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Can be bought from Farengar or from Tolfdir.\n<br />[b]\n<br />What are the mod requirements?[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Obviously, you need Skyrim. Nothing else is necessary.\n<br />\n<br />[b]How to install?[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Drop the files into your Skyrim/Data folder.\n<br />\n<br />[b]How to uninstall?[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Drop the robes, uncheck the .esp, delete the files.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Are there any compatibility problems?[/b]\n<br />\n<br />One or both mages may not have them in their inventory if there is another mod that modifies their merchant chests. If that is the case, move DragonRobes.esp to be LAST in your loading order, and get the robes. Now you can go back to previous loading order if you want.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00]This mod has been cleaned with TES5Edit.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Are there any known bugs?[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Sometimes the game assigns an incorrect magnitude in the enchantment description. [color=#00ffff]However, the enchantment itself uses the correct value.[/color] This has been triple-checked and confirmed to be working.",
