  "summary": "I had to CTRL + G to save it and create BSA &amp; BSL file from Archive.exe of CK, not BSAOpt, to avoid or fix gray face/dark head. Credit to/collaboration with WK (WaywardKnight). I thank Iceburg for using Alternate Actors NPC.<br /><br />I support WK and Iceburg for this.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Arial]Virility at its finest. I envy some who made Hadvar with long hair. I had my own idea to make Hadvar look good-looking with short, blond balding hair and that's it.\n<br />\n<br />Hadvar's got a new cosmetic look to make him more of a Nordic one, a blond hair, which would match like Ralof's. Now you cannot harm Hadvar by using weapons or magic. His hair is as short and balding to make him in his early 40s or late 30s.\n<br />\n<br />Credits and thanks:\n<br />WaywardKnight for Hadvar with new face look with scars.\n<br />Iceburg for Alternate NPCs and swapping NPC.\n<br />\n<br />Special Optional:\n<br />[/font]VectorPlexus SAM or SOS to make him good-looking.",
