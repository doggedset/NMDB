  "descriptionHtml": "Hello\n<br />Here comes a little simple mod for immersive wenches. My mod gives Immersive wenches vampires fangs. That's something I've been missing for a long time so I decided to make my own mod. So with permission from lordkoz I now release this mod.At the moment, this only works with the Apachii version of Immersive wenches.I do not know if it works with the UNP body. I have just tested this with CBBE.\n<br />If you encounter any problems with this mod, you are welcome to inform me.\n<br />Finally, I would like to thank lordkoz who made this possible",
