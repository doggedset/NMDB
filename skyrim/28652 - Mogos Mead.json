Well, this mod brings it to life.  And such a drink deserves a song in its name....and here it is:[/b]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[i]I knew meself a maiden fair\r\nWith em\\'rald eyes and fire-red hair\r\nShe owned a tavern by the sea\r\nAnd served warm drinks of mellow honey\r\n\r\nDrink ye merry, drink ye thirsty\r\nBring thy crew n\\'revel freely\r\nFor on one thing we\\'re all agreed,\r\nThat Mogo made the finest mead\r\n\r\nMogo\\'s mead, Mogo\\'s mead\r\nThe only drink we\\'d e\\'er need\r\nTake a flask and take a seat\r\nAnd drink thyself a sweety-treat![/i]\r\n\r\nAnd here\\'s a bad rendition of me performing the song:  [url=https://dl.dropbox.com/u/16892419/Music/mogosmeadvoice.mp3]LINK[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]If you like that song, you might want to know of where I was inspired to write it.  Well, I had overheard Mikael and Hulda talking about songs that would be appropriate to sing in the tavern, and one of them was brought up by Hulda, \\\"I was thinking Mogo\\'s Mead really gets the place moving.\\\"\r\n\r\nHere is a video:\r\n\r\n[youtube]4lufkuL7Aiw[/youtube]\r\n\r\nAnd after trying a delicious cup of medieval style mead for myself....well, I am hopelessly addicted.  xD  \r\n\r\nSo...enjoy the MEAD!![/b]\r\n\r\n",
