  "descriptionHtml": "A small mod that adds a new Argonian follower to the game. I noticed a lack of followers from the Argonian race and decided to create my own. Shar-khan is a fully outfitted Argonian warrior who has the basic follower dialogue, and is convenient for those wanting a capable follower. You can find and recruit him from The Bannered Mare in Whiterun; there are no requirements to earn his allegiance. You can give him items as with a normal follower, but he is already well armed and has a suit of armour ready equipped. All in all, he is a good companion to have early on, and with the right equipment he can handle most enemies late in the game.",
