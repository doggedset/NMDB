  "summary": "",
  "descriptionHtml": "\r<br />My first published mod. Introducing a new follower, Kitra&#33;\r<br />\r<br />She is a rogue Dunmer Thief, so she DOES belong to the Thieves Guild, wearing the same outfit and all but she never goes into the Cistern or the Ragged Flagon. She is the sister of Karliah, and former lover of Brynjolf. In a later update you will find 10 diaries belonging to her from 25 years ago, so you will be able to discover everything about the members back then and how the Thieves Guild worked. \r<br />\r<br />I hope to be able to make a quest about her or even an additional main Thieves Guild quest, so you will learn more things about her. If anyone is good at scripting and all that &#39;making quests&#39; stuff, please PM me, I appreciate the help. \r<br />\r<br />Kitra is the first follower in my series. So if anyone wants their own follower made especially for them or wants a marriageable follower, please PM me too&#33; \r<br />\r<br />I will soon make her marriageable for people who want to marry her.",
