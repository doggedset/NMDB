  "descriptionHtml": "I cant be the only one who originally played on an un-modified game to those individuals who fought \r\n\r\nthe patient fight and had no way to fix the things they didn't like or played a mage play through and \r\n\r\nlamented that there were no un-enchanted shrouded robes and found they sucked even low \r\n\r\ndifficulty's then look back on those memory's with fondness with the dark brotherhoods now \r\n\r\n(potentially awesome) shrouded robes the its all really explained in the small \r\n\r\ndescription however once I am 100% certain it is bug free I will include an edit for the default \r\n\r\nshrouded robes removing the armour designation for pure mages \r\n\r\nrobes can be found in the dawn star sanctuary downstairs on a box (near the worn shrouded armour) currently only one set \r\n\r\n(might have moved a crate a little while editing I moved it back as neatly as I could\r\n\r\njust walk up introduce yourself melt their skin off and run like the wind works every time - Festus Krex on his modus operandai\r\n\r\ncompatibilities \r\n\r\n\r\nas this is a simple edit it shouldn't conflict with anything as this edits the stats retextures should be fine (a high res retexture would be fantastic)",
