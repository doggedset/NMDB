  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][b][u]Better Interior Lights - Breezehome[/u][/b][/size]\r\nby Splat\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]n.b.:[/b] For best experience, use with Realistic Lighting with Customization.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][i]DISCLAIMER:[/i][/b] This is my first mod ever and, as such, I\\'m still learning to use the Creation Kit. [i]Constructive[/i] feedback is encouraged and very much appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlaying Skyrim with one of the many existing lighting mods is a great way to add some visual depth and excitement to the game; but, while such mods make dungeon crawling and midnight strolls more atmospheric experiences, they may unfortunately plunge your cozy abode into darkness. Better Interior Lights brightens your home up by adding to and improving the existing light sources while still attempting to maintain the depth brought by lighting mods. Now you can stop waving those torches around your house! Seriously, that\\'s a fire hazard.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]What it Does:[/u][/b]\r\n[list][*]Adds a number of light sources to particularly dark corners. (Bonus: Lydia will no longer seem to lurk suspiciously in the shadows.)\r\n[*]Adds a few light sources and lighting effects to the upstairs area. Light will now stream in through the slats of the roof and reflect the time of day outside.\r\n[*]Adds a toxic, green glow to the alchemy table. Avoid prolonged exposure to alchemical fumes.\r\n[*]Alters the existing window light sources to reflect the time of day outside.\r\n[*]Fixes the notorious Breezehome shadow striping. Hooray![/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]What it Doesn\\'t Do:[/u][/b]\r\n[list][*]Add, remove, or alter any textures, meshes, scripts, etc.\r\n[*]Move, remove, or alter any vanilla objects (shelves, chests, drawers, etc.)\r\n[*]Look particularly appealing with Skyrim\\'s vanilla lighting. But that\\'s not really what this is intended for.[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Installation:[/u][/b]\r\n[list][*]Download with NMM. Cake!\r\n[*]To uninstall, simply deactivate with NMM.[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Known Issues:[/u][/b]\r\n[list][*]The light cast on one of the wall segments in the alchemy room may blink on and off. As this is my first mod and I\\'m still learning the CK, I\\'ll be looking for a fix.[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Mods Shown:[/u][/b]\r\n[list][*]Official HD Texture Pack\r\n[*][url=\\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7654\\\"]Realistic Lighting with Customization[/url] by Plutoman101 et al.\r\n[*][url=\\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12693\\\"]Einherjar Armor[/url] by Omesean\r\n[*][url=\\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17250\\\"]Regent Armory[/url] by backstept[/list]",
