  "descriptionHtml": "[b]AL&#39;S &#34;NOTHING SELLS FOR ZERO GOLD&#34; TWEAK[/b]\r<br />\r<br />A notoriously eccentric Bosmer merchant (okay, &#34;eccentric&#34; and &#34;Bosmer merchant&#34; is kinda redundant) is diving into the bold market of speculation. Having seen that, after the end of Dwemer civilization, now the simplest item from their ruins is a valuable artifact - he believes that once the dragons have destroyed Nordic civilzation, the basest items of Skyrim will become of incalculable price. He now buys up every cheap, common item he can, hoarding them in anticipation of the World-Being-Eaten.\r<br />\r<br />The various merchants throughout the holds, being the upstanding supportive people they are, are more than eager to sell the Bosmer random junk for more than they&#39;re worth, and will give the recovering pack rat good Imperial gold for his possessions...\r<br />\r<br />------\r<br />\r<br />When I first started playing Skyrim, I was ecstatic that all the random items weren&#39;t worth zero gold, like they were in Oblivion. God, I hated that. What&#39;s the point of a loot-and-kill game if you can&#39;t loot everything in sight?&#33;\r<br />\r<br />But then the other shoe dropped, and it turned out that, at low levels with correspondingly low Speech, some of the lower-value items would in fact sell for NOTHING.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is a simple .esp file which fixes that. When the CK comes out, I may think about actually adding an eccentric Bosmer merchant into the game, but for now, every single item in the game that was previously worth 0 gold, 1 gold, or 2 gold, has been adjusted to have a base value of 3 gold. That seems to be the mininum value for an item to sell for at least 1 gold even with a starting Speech of 15.\r<br />\r<br />Now, I know it&#39;s not like opportunities for gold are scarce or anything, but it really bugs me to have to pay close attention to what I&#39;m picking up so I don&#39;t waste space carrying worthless junk. If you agree, download it&#33; ^-^\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Install using Nexus Mod Manager. If you do not use NMM, then you will need an unzipping utility such as IZarc to extract the contents of the Zip file you downloaded, then extract the contexts of the zip file into your Skyrim/Data folder. There should not be any overwriting involved, as the only file in the zip is the .esp file.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Possible Conflicts[/b]\r<br />\r<br />The only thing that should at all conflict with this mod is another mod that also adjusts the values of cheap junk. I doubt there are many - if any at all - mods that do that, so there shouldn&#39;t be a problem.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Credits[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Bethesda for a great game\r<br />SkyrimNexus for a great site\r<br />SkyEdit and the people who are still hard at work on it\r<br />\r<br />[b]Permissions[/b]\r<br />\r<br />This isn&#39;t really anything special; just running through the values in Skyedit and editing them, so it&#39;s hardly original work. If you do for some reason decide to modify this or upload it to another site, please notify me first, and credit me; in addition, put a link to my original mod.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Changelog[/b]\r<br />\r<br />v1.0 -- 2/3/2012 -- First release&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]OTHER MODS BY ME[/u]:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Al&#39;s Completionist Series:\r<br />    1.
