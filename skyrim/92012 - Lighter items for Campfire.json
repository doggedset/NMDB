  "descriptionHtml": "Hello!\n<br />\n<br />[b]This mod only tweaks the weight of items in Campfire.\n<br />[/b]Full credits for this mod go to Chesko.\n<br />\n<br />While playing with Campfire, I've noticed how often I'd be slowed down because of how much I carried. This was mostly because the most frequently used resources were quite heavy, so I've made them lighter, not too significantly, but enough to make a difference once you start stacking.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Below is a list of the specific changes.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Linen wrap: 3 -&gt; 1\n<br />[*]Branches: 0.5 -&gt; 0.1\n<br />[*]Firewood and deadwood: 5 -&gt; 1\n<br />[*]Tanning rack: 10 -&gt; 6\n<br />[*]Deer hide (including Vale Deer hide): 2 -&gt; 1\n<br />[*]Bear pelt (all kinds): 3 -&gt; 2\n<br />[*]Wolf pelt (all kinds): 3 -&gt; 1\n<br />[*]Werewolf pelt: 5 -&gt; 2\n<br />[*]Goat hide: 1 -&gt; 0.5\n<br />[*]Mammoth hide: 12 -&gt; 5 (Realistic Wildlife Loot)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Leather tents (all kinds): -2\n<br />[*]Fur tents (all kinds): -6\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Installation[/b]\n<br />Simply drop the file in your Skyrim/Data folder.\n<br />Load after Campfire and Realistic Wildlife Loot.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility\n<br />[/b]This was made compatible with Realistic Wildlife Loot by Xion209.\n<br />This most likely conflicts with any mod that changes the weight of these items. Not yet sure how compatible this is with Animallica, if I notice any conflict I'll try to fix them.",
