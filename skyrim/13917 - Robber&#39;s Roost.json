Rumour has it around Falkreath that it&#39;s currently inhabited by bandits. \r<br />\r<br />Includes bedrolls, smithing tools & storage.\r<br />\r<br />n.b. the grass coming through the floor & missing top exterior roof panels are deliberate features to give the look of an old decaying building.\r<br />\r<br />*Latest version has been cleaned with TES5Edit (see changelog below for details) \r<br />\r<br />[center][url=http://www.skyrimgems.com][img]http://i.imgur.com/sSbds.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />A big thank you to Ka3mOn for considering Robber&#39;s Roost to be featured on his Skyrim GEMS site.\r<br />\r<br />22/7/12 - PLEASE NOTE - *IF ANYONE HAS A ROBBERSROOST.BSA FILE IN THEIR SKYRIM/DATA FOLDER, THEN PLEASE JUST DELETE IT, AS THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE UPLOAD&#33;* \r<br />\r<br />(ONLY THE ROBBERSROOST.ESP FILE IS NEEDED)\r<br />\r<br />-------\r<br />F.A.Q.\r<br />-------\r<br />\r<br />Q. Will the bandits respawn?\r<br />A. No.\r<br />\r<br />----------------------\r<br />Changelog\r<br />----------------------\r<br />v1.1 \r<br />*flickering issue with wall panel at lower left front of building has been corrected. \r<br />*I have &#39;relayed&#39; the floor with lighter coloured pinewood floorboards, which I think looks a lot better (and no more flickering floor issue whereby I&#39;d accidentally layed down 2 floor pieces immediately on top of one another previously).\r<br />*There&#39;s now a hole in the floor beneath the stairs, hopefully adding slightly to the &#39;decaying building&#39; look.\r<br />*A grindstone has been added.\r<br />*Added 2 bird nests in the hayloft also.\r<br />\r<br />v1.2 - 28/2/12\r<br />**Complete Navmesh overhaul** Hand Navmeshed whole of interior and large area around exterior of building. NPC movement will now be much better. \r<br />\r<br />v1.21 - 28/2/12 \r<br />*More extensive Navmesh coverage around exterior of building to boundaries of the RobbersRoost Tamriel worldspace cell.\r<br />\r<br />v1.25 - 30/3/12 \r<br />Added night lighting effects for lanterns & added two lanterns downstairs. Also added cobweb effects.\r<br />\r<br />v1.251 22/7/12 Minor Navmesh tweaks. Removed .bsa file that should never have been there :-/\r<br />\r<br />v1.26  23/9/13 Cleaned with TES5Edit v3.0.30 Experimental. Removed 14 ITM records, 4 Undeleted records, repaired 1 deleted Navmesh  ",
