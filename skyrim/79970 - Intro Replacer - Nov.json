  "descriptionHtml": "[center]Hi everyone,\r<br />what you see here is the beginning of a monthly Series im planning.\r<br />I&#39;ll try to finish at least one (1) Song each Month and upload it as an Intro-Replacer.\r<br />\r<br />Disclaimer:\r<br />I&#39;m sure a lot of you guys are probably saying, why in the Hell would anybody want to replace Skyrim&#39;s Soundtrack&#33;?\r<br />And you are actually 100% right. In fact i couldn&#39;t agree more.\r<br />What Jeremy Soule wrote for this Game is nothing else, but a Masterwork&#33;\r<br />But, even the greatest Tune out there can get a bit too familiar, if you hear it a 1000 Times.\r<br />And since this Mod will only replace the Intro Song, i thought i&#39;ll give it a try.\r<br />\r<br />Here is a Link to my Youtube Channel, for those who care.\r<br />\r<br />https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6y_H_0vomknkEM-SbgGVOQ\r<br />\r<br />Ok, enjoy the Game everyone. You&#39;ll hear from me.[/center]",
