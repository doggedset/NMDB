  "descriptionHtml": "This mod let you join the War of the Crag - ancient war between Dwarvens and Falmers in 1E 700. I created three different fights in which you can take part:\r\n\r\n~[size=3]Sightless Pit[/size] - [i]great battle in Temple of Xrib[/i]\r\n~[size=3]Raldbthar[/size] - [i]dwemer assault in Deep Market[/i]\r\n~[size=3]Bthardamz[/size] - [i]warfare on entire area[/i]\r\n\r\nThat places has been modified. You can still complete quests in Raldbthar and Bthardamz (however in second one there aren\\'t a few minor aliases). \r\n\r\n Beware. Falmers may turn out very tough (they are leveling between 3 and 100 level, but don\\'t underestimate them even at their 3rd level) even if you have assist of many dwarves. You are able to fight only against Falmers; Dwemers will never turn against you, so you needn\\'t worry about unwittingly hit to ally.\r\nI also attached simply retexture of Dwarven sphere (glowing, green eyes). If you don\\'t like it, just don\\'t copy folder:  \\\"dwarvenspherecenturion\\\" located in data/textures/actors in my mod.\r\n\r\n\r\n[center]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/center]\r\n[center][i]Installation:[/i][/center]\r\n[center]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/center]\r\nPut it into: X:.../steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/data\r\n\r\n\r\n[center]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/center]\r\n[center][i]Requirements:[/i][/center]\r\n[center]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/center]\r\nSpace Wiking Dwemer Exoskeleton: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19212/\r\nCloaks of Skyrim: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12092\r\n\r\n\r\n[center]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/center]\r\n[center][i]Before Install![/i][/center]\r\n[center]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/center]\r\n- I made this mod as optional plugin. I recommend to prepare yourself and your companions and save before install mod. Then install it, experience battles and turn off plugin in launcher at the end. If you want to fight again,  select plugin in launcher again. This will protect your gameplay and saves from potential bugs and you can use it with other mods which edited that places.\r\n- There are over 80 fighting npces in Temple of Xrib at once. It may slow your game (I have decrease to 50 fps what is sufficient). Other locations also provide many actors.\r\n\r\n\r\n[center]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/center]\r\n[center][i]Credits:[/i][/center]\r\n[center]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/center]\r\nNikinoodles, Zenl and Backsteppo - [i]for Cloaks[/i]\r\nSpaceWiking - [i]for his dwarven Exoskeleton[/i]",
