  "descriptionHtml": "EDIT:\r\n1.1 is up, fixed the mirror image on the shield.\r\n\r\na while ago i began the idea of a \\'Crests Mod\\' by re-texturing Whiterun guards to carry my own coat of arms, found below:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2722\r\n\r\nthen it continued with the Bauer family crest:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3080\r\n\r\nand now it also contains the Clan Maclean :) obviously this has a very scottish theme (perfect seeing as im currently still in the process of completing my \\'Tartan Stormcloaks\\') this pack replaces the city of Dawnstar, i hope thats OK MalakaiV? but you didnt mention which city you wanted... if you want it for a different city, just re-name the files parts that say \\'dawnstar\\' into a different city name.\r\n\r\nFeel free to make requests for your own Coat of arms to replace a cities colors by simply sending me a PM or commenting on here with a link to your crest, your preffered colors and which city you want replaced.\r\n\r\nCallaghan04",
