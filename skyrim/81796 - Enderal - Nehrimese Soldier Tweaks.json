  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3][b]Enderal - Nehrimese Soldier Tweaks[/b] \n<br />[/size]\n<br />For an army that's been described as being superior to Enderal's in practically every way in dialogue and in universe, I found that hard to believe when I see them get wiped out by basically anybody.  What this mod does is improve upon the rather lackluster stats the Nehrimese have (in general) as well as make a few minor changes to make them more of a credible threat.\n<br />\n<br />It's highly recommended to activate this BEFORE the end of MQ09 (The Lion's Den) so the additional soldiers are enabled at the quest's conclusion.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]MAIN CHANGES[/b]\n<br />===============\n<br />\n<br /> - Sets the level for most soldiers from 25-30.  A handful of them are now between levels 30-40.  This makes it harder for certain talents and spells being used against them (especially for lower level players), as previously many of their levels were set in the single digits.\n<br /> - Increases their combat related stats so they're more proficient in that area.  \n<br /> - Health has been increased, so on average they range from 250-300 HP, up from ~150 HP.  Reduced slightly for troops at level 40 and ones encountered at the endgame to reduce damage sponginess.\n<br /> - Adds the heavy armor variant, so officers and select soldiers now wear heavy armor.  Stats are in between Fine Steel and Rune armor.\n<br /> - Troops at outposts now respawn to give the impression that more are landing.  Slightly increased the number stationed at these outposts.\n<br /> - Re-enables another group that was supposed to appear in Goldenforst, and adds more soldiers to this group.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]MISC. CHANGES[/b]\n<br />===============\n<br />\n<br /> - Alma now uses a sword instead of an axe to better fit dialogue about her.\n<br /> - Used unused assets in the game files to replace the models for the regular boots and gloves, since the originals were bugged or the texture wasn't mapped correctly.\n<br /> - Made some adjustments to outfits.\n<br /> - Level 40 Nehrimese are named as \"Elite Nehrimese Soldiers.\"  Even in vanilla Enderal they already had better stats and equipment compared to their weaker counterparts.\n<br /> - Changes the appearance of a few soldiers to prevent them from looking too identical from each other.\n<br />- Added Nehrimese Battlemages/Spellswords to replace some Wild Mages with the Nehrimese.\n<br />- Increased experience gained from certain Nehrimese soldiers.\n<br />\n<br /> \n<br />[b]REQUIRES:\n<br />[/b]===========\n<br />\n<br />Skyrim\n<br />Enderal\n<br />Enderal Launcher\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]INSTALLATION: \n<br />[/b]===============\n<br />\n<br /> Simply place the esp file in the Skyrim data folder and enable it in the Enderal launcher.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]UNINSTALL[/b]:\n<br />============\n<br />\n<br />Check it off in the Enderal launcher and delete it from the Skyrim Data folder.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]INCOMPATIBILITY/ISSUES[/b]:\n<br />========================\n<br />\n<br />Only thing I've found so far is that in 1st person, the Nehrimese Heavy Gauntlets are kinda odd looking.  Unfortunately I couldn't find a 1st person mesh for it.  Also, anything that edits Nehrimese soldiers.\n<br />\n<br />Feedback is much appreciated!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]CREDITS:\n<br />[/b]=========\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to SureAI for this wonderful TC and for letting me reuse the assets in the game files.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]CHANGELOG[/b]:\n<br />=============\n<br />\n<br />1.0 - Initial release\n<br />1.1 - Re-enables another group, readjusts some stats, and changes the appearance of a few soldiers\n<br />2.0 - Updated for compatibility with the latest 1.2.4.0 patch.  Replaces certain Wild Mages that were with some soldiers with Nehrimese Battlemages/Spellswords. Also adjusted experience gained, combat AI, stats, and appearances for some soldiers.",
