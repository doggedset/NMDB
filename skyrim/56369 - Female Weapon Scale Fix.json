  "summary": "Small mod to cover-up the Down-scale of size when a female draws a weapon.",
  "descriptionHtml": "= INFORMATION =\r<br />It&#39;s been driving me nuts that my female character&#39;s great sword shrinks when she draws it, and grows when she puts it on her back. So here is a small mod to cover-up that up (or make it less obvious, at least), for anyone else who is annoyed by this.\r<br />\r<br />I tried to adjust the drawn weapon to be exactly the same as the sheathed version. However, i have no clue what the actual scale value is. So it&#39;s a ball-park, and i suck at judging this stuff........... So if you think it needs to be adjusted comment/message me, yeah? Right now it is sitting at 1.18x it&#39;s normal drawn size for 2-handed weapons, and 1.25x for one-handed.\r<br />\r<br />- Works for all weapons.\r<br />\r<br />- This mod is still new and in beta, so let me know if you run into any problems. I greatly appreciate bug reports, or even just constructive criticism.\r<br />\r<br />- Don&#39;t forget to endorse if you like it ^^\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />= REQUIREMENTS =\r<br />- SKSE 1.6+\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />= UPDATE LOG =\r<br /> 0.1b - Initial Release. Only affects 2-hand melee weapons\r<br /> 0.2b - Now works for the above, as well as bows and one-handed melee weapons (both left and right).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />= INSTALL =\r<br />- Download and extract to your skyrim folder.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />= UPDATE =\r<br />- Just over-write the existing install, that&#39;s it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />= FUTURE =\r<br />- Alternate version to downscale weapon on back to match drawn size.\r<br />- Alternate version to affect all female NPCs.\r<br />- User suggestions welcome.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />= KNOWN ISSUES =\r<br />- May not work the first time you load. Save your game, reload, and you should be okay. (Trying to find a work around.)",
