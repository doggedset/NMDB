  "descriptionHtml": "[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6713]SSE Version\n<br />\n<br />[/url]A little mod that removed the invisible walls around some objects like the whiterun walls the solitude DB Escape Bridge\n<br />\n<br />This has all been done in TES5Edit. \n<br />\n<br />What i done in the esp is put all of the collision markers values to 0, this allows you to get around some of the barriers that are placed in some areas like the golden glow quest island. \n<br />\n<br />There may be some that shouldn't be set to 0 but going though and looking at all of them in CK is a pain and all the other markers and objects get in the way so i can't really see them at all.\n<br />\n<br />Now the Esp only gets rid of most of them but there are still meshes that has them as well.\n<br />\n<br />I know why they put the barriers there but i found them annoying so i got rid of them. \n<br />\n<br />There may be some invisible walls that are intentional and should not be removed but its minor.This does work with open cites, now you can jump into whiterun without using the gate. What a rebel.\n<br />\n<br />There are still bigger collision on some meshes so u wont be able to get pass everything that, and some meshes dont even have collision of some parts of them so you will clip and fall into it.\n<br />\n<br />Theres a couple of meshes that conflicts with SMIN and Enhanced Textures Detail (UV-Tweaks)...\n<br />\n<br />I would recommend putting this at the very bottom of the load order.",
