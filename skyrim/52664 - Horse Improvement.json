  "descriptionHtml": "As a hardcore roleplayer and an immersion player, I felt that the stables lacked life and things that set them apart. I couldn&#39;t find a mod that would change this, so there went my study hours. \r<br />Changes the horse models to unique and town fitting. Makes Frost and Shadowmere stand out ( With Shadowmere I didn&#39;t include custom textures, and I removed the glow. Because no one will suspect a thing when ou ride on a huge ass aggressive horse with glowing red eyes.)\r<br />Horse Improvement for Skyrim, modifies worldspaces of Riften stable, Solitude stable, Markarth stable and Whiterun stable.\r<br />Adds unique Frost and Shadowmere.\r<br />\r<br />V1\r<br />Adds lesser holds and inns, re-does most of the horse model.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Install\r<br />=======\r<br />1. Extract the files to a temporary location.\r<br />2. Examine the folder structure and make corrections where necessary.\r<br />3. Copy files to (install folder)SkyrimData\r<br />4. Start Skyrim Launcher, click &#39;Data Files&#39;, place a checkmark beside the .esp file(s).\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall\r<br />=========\r<br />Remove added files.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Incompatibility\r<br />===============\r<br />\r<br />Will be incompatible with any mod that directly modifies Player horses in the game, if you want to change a model of a horse\r<br />Shadowmere.nif = Shadowmere&#39;s horse file\r<br />Shadowmere1.nif = Shadowmere&#39;s tack\r<br />Frost.nif = Frost&#39;s horse file\r<br />Frostsaddle.nif = Frosts tack\r<br />IF YOU CHANGE THE HORSE FILE, YOU MUST SUBSTITUTE THE TACK WITH A VANILLA FILE, THE TACK WILL CLIP IMPROPERLY ON OTHER MESHES.\r<br />\r<br />Also, &#34;convenient horses&#34; mod armors clip badly with Frost and Shadowmere, also third person clipping issues on rider. I&#39;ll get around to working on those.\r<br />Otherwise &#34;convenient horses&#34; modifications should stick since I haven&#39;t touched any of that stuff.\r<br />\r<br />(Load Order)\r<br />If you have horse modifying files, load Horse improvement after them.\r<br />",
