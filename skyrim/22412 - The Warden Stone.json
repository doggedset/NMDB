  "descriptionHtml": "A conjurer\\'s former apprentice seeks out the artifact he believes gives the master his power...but what other powers belong to The Warden Stone?\r\n\r\nThis is a small quest and dungeon mod that I built to demonstrate a new dungeon mechanic. To begin the quest, read the note located on the dead courier outside Wardenstone\\'s Rest, which is east of Riverwood, just south of Bleakfalls Barrow. (Map uploaded in the images)\r\n\r\nIf you like my mod, please endorse it, and try out my Quest, which also adds a new dungeon, [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15896]The Dead Bee Scrolls[/url]\r\n\r\nA thanks to Joel Burgess for posting his transcripts that gave me the idea.",
