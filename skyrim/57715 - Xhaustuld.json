  "descriptionHtml": "Xhaustuld is two story player home in whiterun. It&#39;s generally finished as it is. Has a Smelter, Anvil, Tanning Rack, Workbench, and Grindstone. One chest inside is not owned, never thought it too important to change ownership. Also renames the town to Calchester, and renames Vilmyr Inn &#39;Frost Troll Inn&#39; but I didn&#39;t change the sign. I was going to do more with it but decided against it.Â \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Edit[/b]:\r<br />I didn&#39;t remove ANYTHING from the area, I simply moved him over to the mill. If he isn&#39;t there wait and he should reappear. I haven&#39;t had any of the bugs that have been reported. It&#39;s likely your game, not the mod. Additionally, I&#39;m going to change the name back to Ivarstead and rename the inn when I get the time. I only made this because I had nothing better to do it&#39;s bound to have problems.",
