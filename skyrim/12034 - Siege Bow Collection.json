I will upload the fix soon.\r\n-- Suggested mod to Download. This mod will help counter-act the guards unlimited arrow usage (So guards no longer assault you indefinitely with the powerful bolts and arrows).

(Skip to ~1:48 for the SBC)\r\n[youtube]9mtlLuoLivM[/youtube]\r\nThanks to Saiodin\r\n\r\n==============================\r\n0. [B]Table of Contents:[/B]\r\n------------------------------\r\n0.

This is [U][B]NOT[/B][/U] my file, I have been given permission by the creators to upload it to Skyrimnexus.com. The mod is currently offered [U][B]AS IS[/B][/U] and will not be updated in any shape by me, until I have been granted exclusive permission to do so. That is not to say the creators are not being informed of bugs that are discovered and working on fixing them.\r\nB. Those of you interested in the armor worn in the screen shots, please visit the very BOTTOM of this page for the link to the author\\'s mod here on Skyrim Nexus.\r\n\r\n==============================\r\n2. [B]Brief Description[/B]\r\n------------------------------\r\nFirst and foremost, I want to say thank you to the Korean Skyrim modders, [B]Rising and Alucard-f[/B], for giving me permission to upload their mod to this site. All credits go to them entirely, I am simply the uploader for Skyrim Nexus.\r\n\r\nThat aside, I am proud to present to you the Siege Bows and Backpack Collection by Rising and Alucard-f from Korea! This collection contains eight variations of the Siege Bow, as well as some elaborate and rather large quivers, each unique in look. These bows are meant to be tiered and cannot easily be obtained. You must [B]craft, kill, explore, and loot[/B] your way through Skyrim to collect the necessary supplies to make them. However, the first three will be your easiest, those after that will [U]require[/U] you to [B]craft, kill, explore, and loot[/B] to find the necessary supplies.\r\n\r\n==============================\r\n3. [B]Ammo Types[/B]\r\n------------------------------\r\nThe bows come with the ability to fire many different variations of ammo types, that can all be crafted at the [b]tanning rack[/b].\r\n[B]NOTE:[/B] The ammo types you will see depends heavily on the bow you wish to use, and the bow(s) you have in your inventory at the time that you use the rack!\r\n[B]Ammo Types:[/B]\r\n- Small Ballista Triggers -- Small bolt \\\"shotgun\\\" effect -- Check Images\r\n- Small Ballista Triggers(Dingo) -- Same as above but for the Dingo\r\n- Shotgun Bullets(Bulldog) -- Shoots a collection of 6-8 explosive rounds (looks like spiked balls)\r\n- Gearmines(Punsandog) -- mine with a curved trajectory.\r\n- Grenade Launcher -- Self Explanatory -- May be a little overpowered (Haven\\'t tested in combat personally)\r\n- Tactical Grenade Launcher (Fear) -- when this projectile hits the ground or enemy. It will explode with dust and release a scream, enemies are frightened, so they will run away from player. Causes no damage.\r\n- Tactical Arrows(Sensor) -- Presumably sensor explosive. (Have not tested in combat yet)\r\n- Tactical Arrows(Timer) -- Fires bolt that will explode after a couple of seconds. (Looks like a spiked ball)\r\n- Hextuple Ballista Bolts -- Fires a single bolt with 6 bolts attached to it\r\n- Ballista Bolts - Single ballista bolt\r\n- Magical Bolts (x1,x3,x6) -- Magical Bolts that cause a fire explosion on impact (Fire lingers for a moment), X1,X3,X6 determines the amount of bolts fired/effect\r\n- Triple Bolts -- Fires 3 Ballista bolts that have shockwave effect\r\n- Default Skyrim Arrows (Steel, Elven, Dwarven, Iron, etc.)\r\n\r\nNOTE: Not all of the above mentioned will be able to be used on all variations of the siege bows, they are meant to be specific for each type, and can only be made when you have the specific bow in your inventory!\r\nNOTE: Some variations upon being fired, on impact, will set fire to a small area around the impact zone for a small amount of time, use with caution.\r\nNOTE: The above ammo types, will be what uses the customized quivers, some can be rather large depending on the ammo type, while others may be smaller. This can of course be changed with the optional .ESP. \r\n\r\n==============================\r\n4. [B]Installation of the Mod and Optionals[/B]\r\n------------------------------\r\nInstallation of Main File:\r\nOpen and extract files from, \\\"Siege Bow Collection.zip\\\" into your skyrim root folder.\r\nSTEAM: *\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\r\nNOTE: If it askes to override, hit yes to all.\r\n\r\nOptional File Installation:\r\n\r\nOptional: Reduced Explosion -- Reduces the shockwave or Shout effect from some of the bolts (Hextuple is one), this may not remove the fire explosion that are caused by some of the bolts, as this is  the intent of some bolts. (Still testing)\r\nOpen and extract files from, \\\"Optional_reduced_explosion.zip\\\" into your skyrim root folder.\r\nSTEAM: *\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\r\nNOTE: If it askes to override, hit yes to all.\r\n\r\nOptional: Normal Dwarven Quiver\r\nOpen and extract files from, \\\"Optional_Default_Quivers.zip\\\" into your skyrim root folder.\r\nSTEAM: *\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\r\nNOTE: If it askes to override, hit yes to all.\r\n\r\n==============================\r\n5. [B]Uninstall[/B]\r\n------------------------------\r\nTo uninstall remove the following files/folders from your Skyrim\\\\data directory\r\nBallista Archer folder located:*\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\meshes\\\\weapons\\\\dwarven\r\nPoongsan Folder located:*\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\r\n.ESP in your Data Folder: Siege Bow & Backpacks.esp\r\n\r\n==============================\r\n6. [B]Using the Mod[/B]\r\n------------------------------\r\nAfter you install the mod, load your save game and go to the nearest forge. It doesn\\'t matter what forge, any will do. Once there, use the forge, and go to the Dwarven tab. The first four bows will be at the very bottom of the Dwarven list, so scroll down (in the event you have a long list). The beginning bows will require you to craft or purchase a Dwarven bow, a enchanted Dwarven will not work. As you go up in quality, V5 and V6 will appear at the top of the Dwarven list, YOU MUST EXIT the forge and re-enter it to see this, after you\\'ve made V4. Once V5 and V6 have been made, V7 will appear at the bottom of the list with V1-V4, as well once V7 is made, V8 will appear there as well.\r\n\r\nIn order to create the special ammo for these bows, you must go to the TANNING RACK. There, depending on the bow(s) you have in your inventory, the special ammos will appear. They will require Dwarven Arrows, or Ingots to make, as well as some other supplies depending on the one you desire.\r\n\r\nBelow are the included bows in this collection, please note I have listed them in their tier order. However, the first three(V1-V3) are not truly part of the tiers, and are considerably larger in size than the last five in the collection(V4-V8):\r\nViolence - V1 (Large)\r\nHeavy Rain - V2 (Large)\r\nSilent Wolf - V3 (Large)\r\nHound - V4 (Normal size of Dwarven Bow)\r\nDingo - V5 (Will not become visible until Hound is in your inventory and you have left the forge)\r\nBulldog - V6 (Will not become visible until Hound is in your inventory and you have left the forge)\r\nLykaon - V7 (Will not become visible until either Bulldog or Hound is in your inventory and you have left the forge)\r\nPunsandog - V8 (Will not become visible until Lykaon is in your inventory and you have left the forge)\r\n\r\nEach weapon\\'s base attack is better than the previous, as you go up in quality you will also go up in the amount of resources and type of resources (Rarity, amount, etc) that will be required for the next version of the weapon. These weapons CAN be upgraded through the grindstone.\r\n\r\n==============================\r\n7. [B]Compatability Issues[/B]\r\n------------------------------\r\n- Currently there are no known compatibility issues. If you discover one please post in the comments section or PM me directly.\r\n- If you use a retexture mod for the Dwarven bow(i.e Heroic Dwarven Armor) it will retexture the base bow of the mod.\r\n\r\n==============================\r\n8. [B]Known Issues[/B]\r\n------------------------------\r\n- Dropping the quiver will cause you to lose it, this could also apply to the standalone backpack \r\n- Currently Violence, Heavy Rain and Silent wolf are considerably bigger than their counterparts. You have been warned. (Check Images to see, Violence - V1)\r\n- Guards shot with any of the special ammo that does not have some type of effect, i.e Ballista Bolts, the guards, can turn around and use these against you infinitely (This can be counter-acted with the suggested mod, under NEWS).\r\n\r\nNOTE: If you discover any bugs, that you believe are caused by this mod specifically please PM me!\r\n\r\n==============================\r\n9. [B]Credits[/B]\r\n------------------------------\r\nRising: Meshing, texturing and original idea\r\nAlucard-f: Creation Kit Modding, balancing and etc.\r\nEaritory: Uploader for Skyrimnexus.com\r\n\r\n==============================\r\nA1.

If you wish to include this collection in a mod of your own, or re-release content of this mod, please contact me through PM.\r\n\r\n==============================\r\nA2. [B]Changelog[/B]\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nv1.0a -- World Mesh Fixed thanks to Cchoay\r\nv1.0 -- Initial Release\r\n\r\n==============================\r\nB1. [B]Standalone Backpacks[/B]\r\n-------------------------------\r\nThe original authors have released a standalone version of the backpacks, please note that these are not usable storage devices and are more for looks. There are 5 total backpacks included in this version. All should be able to be crafted at the Tanning Rack.\r\n\r\nThanks to Shadowjin for this,\r\nBackpack is not exactly straight when used, because it uses quiver place (doesn\\'t replace quiver however) .To get it straight, Use this: \r\n[URL=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6276]1HD Weapons on Back TS Edition[/URL].
