  "descriptionHtml": "So i tried to use both the Breezehome Basement Single Cell 2 - Hearthfire fix by Thivan \r<br />(http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29179/?)\r<br /> along with the Breezehome Firepit Removed by Ghaunadaur \r<br />(http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30241/?)\r<br />and like a few others i ran into a conflict where the basement mod left the flames and coals from the firepit in the center of the floor even though i no longer had a firepit there. all i did was use the creation kit to remove the coals and any light effects from the basement mod so it was compatible with the Firepit Removal Mod. Hope this works for you. if you have other suggestions for me let me know and ill try to get to them.Â ",
