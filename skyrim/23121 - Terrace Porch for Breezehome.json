  "descriptionHtml": "Specifically for players who never tire of doing \\\"nothing,\\\" so long as there\\'s scenery to behold.  \r\n\r\nWatch envious townsfolk stroll by from your back porch, outfitted with authentically modest furnishings and spare provisions for cookouts.  Or recline under the stars with a Nightshade Honey Mead after some farflung campaign.  After all, a patio is only as good as its nights.\r\n\r\nA bit of forgotten backstory may be found to make the yard one\\'s own.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\ndrop everything into Data/Skyrim/\r\n(contains ESP only)\r\n\r\nBUGS\r\nRarely, a bumblebee can knock stuff off your shelf.  (Aerodynamically, they shouldn\\'t even fly, let alone trash the place.)\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nIt\\'s always nice to see screenshots posted of your characters lounging around out back.\r\n\r\nIf you like this, then you might like [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24320]Terrace Patio at Proudspire[/url], [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24857]Courtyard for Windhelm Hjerim[/url], [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26166]Deck and Pier at Honeyside Riften[/url] or [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26856]Stoop Over Markarth[/url].",
