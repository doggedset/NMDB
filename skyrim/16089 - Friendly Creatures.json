Thanks very much you guys, i accept this with great honor!\r\n[/center]\r\n\r\nThanks for your interest in this mod.\r\nPlease go easy on me, this is my first ever mod made using the Creation Kit.\r\n\r\nI felt that alot of wandering creatures are too hostile and that they should be friendlier.\r\nIt also felt like a hassle to ride my horse down the road/river only to be attacked by a \r\nrandom skeever or mudcrab.\r\n\r\nNot all creatures are set to be non-aggressive, only some which i felt a non-aggressive \r\nbehaviour would suit them more. Some however are non-aggressive because they are \r\ntoo common, and the chances of meeting them are very high. (Eg: Wolves)\r\n\r\nHave searched around and only found 2 such mods that modified only the mudcrab and slaughterfish. So i decided to make one mod of my own.\r\n\r\nList of Modified Creatures:\r\n==========================\r\nBear\r\nSnow Bear\r\nCave Bear\r\nWolf\r\nIce Wolf\r\nPit Wolf\r\nSkeever\r\nMudcrab\r\nSlaughterfish\r\nHorker\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Incompatible Mods:\r\n======================\r\nSkyrim Monster Mod (Thanks to Jaquiline for highlighting this)\r\n\r\nPlease do let me know if there are any bugs encountered.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdates Log:\r\n===========\r\n\r\nv1.0\r\nInitial Release\r\n\r\nv1.1\r\na) Skeevers\r\nSkeevers sizes are much smaller now. (about 0.4 times the original size)\r\nThey will never initiate combat, and will always avoid/flee from threats\r\n\r\nb) Normal Wolves / Ice Wolves / Pit Wolves (Summon Familiar should not be affected)\r\nAt around 13ft(4metres), they will stop what they are doing and glare at the player.\r\nAt around 6ft(2metres) they will start crouching, barking and get more aggressive. \r\nAfter a couple of seconds if the player is still there, they will attack.\r\nGive em a few punches tho, wear them down and they should stop combat and flee.\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n==========\r\na) Skeevers don\\'t seem to like to move around much after i changed their AI behaviour\r\nHopefully someone can guide me on this.\r\n\r\nb) Sometimes the AI goes wonky and doesn\\'t behave like how the mod dictates them to act.",
