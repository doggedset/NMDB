  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple .esp adding the missing Chitin Heavy Shield to the crafting list for the sake of completeness. I\\'ve attempted to roughly give it the stats it should have, compared to the rest of the armour (Somewhere between Dwarven and Orcish, but lighter, with a slightly higher value and material cost than the Light version). It is craftable under Chitin, and tempered with Chitin, same as the rest of Chitin Armour.\r\n\r\nI\\'m no artist, so it just uses the vanilla Light Chitin Shield mesh and texture - anything that alters those will also alter this shield. I don\\'t know much about levelled lists, so I haven\\'t added it to those.\r\n\r\nRequires Dragonborn, obviously.",
