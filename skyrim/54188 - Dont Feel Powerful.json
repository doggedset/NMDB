  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://s29.postimg.org/veoyfpr3r/Dont_Feel_Powerful_Transparent.png[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=orange]First at all, I&#39;m not an english speaker so I&#39;m sorry if you don&#39;t understand something.[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Don&#39;t Feel Powerful (DFP from now) aims to balance the power that the perks give to you as you progress in the game and increase levels.\r<br />\r<br />I hope not be the one that feel that the high level game is broken, because the cumulative amount of percentage of skills improvements break the feeling of Skyrim is a dangerous place.\r<br />\r<br />That is why I&#39;ve had this mod.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=orange]Then What does the mod?[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />This mod rebalances the amount of percentage that the perks gives us. The changes are the next:\r<br />\r<br /> - [b][color=green]Combat Style Skills[/color][/b] and Perks like one-handed, two-handed and Archery change the values of the main Perk from 20% until 100% to 10% at first perk to 50% with 5 accumulations.\r<br />\r<br /> - [b][color=green]Magic:[/color][/b] Aiming to improve the powerless Vanilla Magic DFP make some changes to 3 magic schools: Destruction, Conjuration and Restoration. Destruction and Restoration improve the damage and effectiveness of spells by 50% and Conjuration improves the spells duration by 100%.\r<br />\r<br /> - The other Perks that not involved directly in combat like Pickpocketing, Stealth, Alchemy or Enchantment are too reduced to 10%-50% min. and max. main Perk values.\r<br />\r<br /> - in addition, [b][color=green]Alchemy and Enchantment[/color][/b] have been seriously decreased. The Perks that improve potions, poisons and skills and elements enchantments have been reduced from 25% to 10% of improvement.\r<br />\r<br />- [b][color=green]Armor Perks[/color][/b] (Light and Heavy) have reduced too until 50% max. values and the specific bonus set perks to 10%.\r<br />\r<br /> - In relation to [b][color=green]Smithing[/color][/b], the feature of double improve weapons and armors have been removed, so the Smithing perks only let you craft the consequent racial or material style of weapons and armors. \r<br />\r<br />[b][color=orange]Installation and Requirements:[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />- It contains two simples .esp mods separated so you can install it with NMM or Unzip in your Data Folder of Skyrim Installation Directory.\r<br />\r<br />- This mod is a simple modification of the Skyrim.esm Perks so you don&#39;t need anything extra.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=orange]Compatibility:[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />- DFP modifies the original perks values and other mods that modify this parameters shouldn&#39;t works together. I don&#39;t know if other perks and skills mods that modify, for example, perk points or experience modifications works with this mod.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=orange]Thanks:[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />- I don&#39;t know if this work already exists, I haven&#39;t looked other people&#39;s works, just nosing around the CK in the perks menu I saw these options and the idea came to me. Anyway, my thanks to everybody that like my mod and I hope nobody sense I&#39;m trampling his/her work, thanks again.\r<br />",
