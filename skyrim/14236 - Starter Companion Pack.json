It includes three NPCs which can be selected as companions.\r\nThey are all located within Whiterun Bannered Mare.\r\n\r\n- Smasher: Barbarian\r\n- Arythilus: Fighter\r\n- Kejuihit: Ranger\r\n\r\nIn the future, more companions will be added in future versions, along with any other changes/additions that may be made.\r\n\r\nAll the companions are now essential as of version 1.1, so they should not die.\r\n\r\nThey act like any other companion, you can give them your stuff to hold if you\\'re running low on space, and will fully fight for you.\r\n\r\nAny feedback will be appreciated, it can help improve the mod and inform me of any bugs.",
