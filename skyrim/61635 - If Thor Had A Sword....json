  "summary": "This sword is way OP. It has 540+ damage and extra shock damage and extra damage to dragons. This sword is mainly for people who want to increase their smithing skill while not using the skill config mod or similar mods like that. This is a god weapon, so it can be used as a one hit kill weapon, that swings at 10x the speed of a normal speed.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds an OP (Overpowered) or &#34;God&#34; weapon, that is a one hit kill, with 540+ damage, and extra shock damage, and swings at 10x the speed of a normal sword. This sword cannot be found anywhere in the skyrim world (Or any mod lands), as it can only be created at a forge. Creating this sword only takes one iron ingot, and creating it increases the smithing skill very quickly (from lvl 0 to ~63, ~63 to ~85, ~85 to ~98, ~98 to ~100, etc.) so this mod could be used for increasing the smithing skill without using mods such as skill config and the like that require SkyUI. When testing this mod i noticed that some NPC killed with the weapon glitch, sometimes falling halfway into the ground, sometimes not falling at all, but no problems that affect gameplay.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]If you have any problems with the file, such as the weapon not appearing in the list of creatable weapons at the forge or no enchantments on the weapon, or any gameplay problems, such as slow FPS while using the weapon or not being able to swing the sword, PLEASE LEAVE A COMMENT.\r<br />[/u][/b]Also, leave a comment if you have any suggestions for new simple mods or changes to this mod.",
