  "summary": "A playable version of the knife you see on the executioner&#39;s robes.",
  "descriptionHtml": "So this modÂ changes the knife attached to the executioner&#39;s robes from being purely aesthetic, to actually being a useable weapon. It was actually harder to make than it sounds, as the weapon wasn&#39;t even a static object, it only existed as part of the robes&#39; mesh. I used Blender and GIMP to make the knife. My third ever 3D modelling and texturing mod project.\r<br />The knife can be found in the Castle Dour Dungeons, and it can also be tempered. \r<br />\r<br />Installation: Just install normally via NMM, or extract the esp to your data folder, and merge the meshes and textures folders with the ones in your data folder.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility: There shouldn&#39;t be any issues.\r<br />\r<br />Hope you enjoy :)",
