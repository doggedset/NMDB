  "descriptionHtml": "So, here&#39;s the thing: I&#39;ve never been a big fan of the Blade of Woe. It kinda looked like someone ripped scales from an Argonian and fashioned a strange shaped dagger from it. To me, anyway. I decided to use my texturing powers (which I learned from hacking Super Smash Bros. Brawl in the KC:MM community) to fashion it differently. A way I would like more. So yeah, now, you got a Silver Blade of Woe. Silver blade, black grip. I loved the result. Do you?",
