  "descriptionHtml": "Update 12/6/16\r<br />I&#39;m planning on updating this mod to fix numerous aesthetic oddities and various placements as well as reworking the lighting to fit most ENB settings. I&#39;m also going to see about making an SE version.\r<br />\r<br />The Hunter&#39;s Shack is ideal for those who prefer minimalism and efficiency without the cost of storage or aesthetics. This mod is also recommended for werewolves, but vampires probably will NOT enjoy it as you&#39;ll soon see. It has all skill/crafting stuff outside along with various plants and mushrooms. There&#39;s fish, all sorts of meats and there&#39;s even a nice area to sit underneath a tree to watch the sun set over the mountains. Inside of the shack, there&#39;s a /lot/ of animal heads, a shrine to Kyne, several storage spaces and racks, a desk with nice aesthetics, a bed, and little knick-knacks/clutter along with a cooking area and a table with dinner on it. There&#39;s a custom book that grants a sneaking level as well titled &#34;Hunter&#39;s Guide To Skyrim&#34; that is wonderfully cheesy and lore friendly. Anyway, the shack is very simple, and the door is already unlocked for you. Happy hunting&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]xuNdYfxmyQ8[/youtube]\r<br />___\r<br />NOTE: I made this for myself and one of my friends who have played the game over and over and now just use it as a catharsis via hunting and gathering. I thought others who enjoy hunting might like this, therefore, I won&#39;t create a non-DLC version. Sorry&#33;\r<br />\r<br />__\r<br />There&#39;s TWO versions of this mod. One for vanilla Whiterun textures and one for any modded textures. The difference between them are the lighting with vanilla being slightly darker. Choose only one and wisely.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />The latest update\r<br />Dawnguard\r<br />Hearthfire\r<br />Dragonborn\r<br />\r<br />How to update: a simple manual overwrite or use the NMM.\r<br />How to Install: Use the NMM or drop the file in your data folder (SteamApps/common/Skyrim/Data)\r<br />How to uninstall: Delete the file. There&#39;s no such thing as a clean uninstall as far as I know.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: There&#39;s probably some clipping here and there or some wonky things about &#39;round the shack, and I&#39;m fixing them as I see them. This is only the first version, so take it with a grain of salt. :)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />___\r<br />Recommended Mods (I hope I&#39;m allowed to state these, if not, let me know):\r<br />Sexy Skyrim (for the pretty textures&#33;) http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/7059/?\r<br />Althirs Camping Tools (a must for hunters&#33;) http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10824/?\r<br />Your Market Stall (to sell your catches and for immersion&#33;) http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35305/?\r<br />\r<br />Conflicts:\r<br />Anything that changes the area the shack is in, I&#39;d imagine. Other than that, I&#39;m unaware of any conflicts and I use over 200+ mods. \r<br />This IS compatible with Breezehome FullyUpgradable\r<br />----\r<br />\r<br />You&#39;re free to use this or add on to it if you want, I only ask that you leave a little link to this in the corner of your mod, and let me know so that I can see it&#33; :D\r<br />\r<br />Questions? Comments? Violent reactions? You know what to do, hehe&#33; ",
