  "descriptionHtml": "This is standalone, half-arsed and [u]male only[/u].\r<br />\r<br />I made it for my own use and I have uploaded it here because I may be unable to access the file offline once I replace my computer. I had planned on releasing a full package of a more diverse selection of recolours (for both male and female characters) and that is still on the table, but for now, this is all I got&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The tunic is classed as Light Armor. I haven&#39;t placed it anywhere in the world, but if you are comfortable using CHIM (console commands&#33;&#33;), you can add the tunic to your inventory by searching &#34;worker&#34; via the console menu. It should be listed under &#34;armo:&#34; as something like &#34;xx000d52&#34; (with &#34;xx&#34; being the number the mod is listed as in your load order).\r<br />\r<br />If you would like to download it yourself, it should work fine (assuming I have packed it right&#33;) and sit around where other armour mods are in your load order. If you have any problems I will try to assist while I still have the means to do so.\r<br />\r<br />Workers of Tamriel unite&#33; &#92;o/",
