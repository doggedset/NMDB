  "descriptionHtml": "There is already an almost identical mod on Steam (Steam exclusive) All it does is replace the sound Fx of goats when they lose their humble lives with that of a &#34;Screaming goat&#34; Completely unlore-friendly. But you know what? Since when do chickens explode? &lt;3  Oh the humor. I&#39;m so funny.\r<br />I don&#39;t hate goats? What? I swear.\r<br />It&#39;s just funny as hell. \r<br />Basically, my router doesn&#39;t have the correct ports for Steam to work. And it&#39;s not my router. For those of you have similar issues, here you go bitches. Screaming goat deaths. I used no previous authors files. Obviously. I can&#39;t get them. But KUDOS to &#34;SorenBC&#34; over at Steam for such ridiculous and brilliant idea. Drag, drop, kill, laugh. \r<br />****My next plan is &#34;Fainting Goats&#34; ;D*********",
