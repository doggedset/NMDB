There is a whole video dedicated to it, you will be surprised how powerful it is, and yet easy to use, opening so many possibilities that your imagination will be in a high state of excitement, you are warned&#33; :)\r<br />\r<br />[u]What to expect and not to expect[/u]\r<br />Since I am not a modder I will not be able to help you on &#34;bugs&#34; with the presented mods in the guide, you will need to refer to the sites that are offering the tools. I took some precaution to propose you only renown  and stable tools, still, some cautions will be required from you, especially to never use your regular saved game files when doing some extreme staging, Jaxonz Positioner is a very powerful tool, and with power comes responsibilities.  \r<br />\r<br />But feel free to ask questions about staging, share new tricks or simply send some crazy images of your own. It&#39;s mainly all about being crazy, in the good way, so simply have fun and I hope I could help a few achieve that.\r<br />\r<br />I would like to thank warmly [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/15479034/?]Raccondance[/url] who helped me in the redaction of the guide, which is still a work in progress. If you visit his gallery, you&#39;ll discover a highly talented fellow...with some very special skills in craziness :)\r<br />\r<br />And to Jaxonz, just a huge hug to have provided the community this wonderful tool that is the Positioner. Someone wrote to me this morning that it is like a portable CK ;)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffd966][size=5]VIDEOS[/size][/color]\r<br />Presentation of useful commands\r<br />[youtube]PhBVcYLeaKQ[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Presenting Jaxonz Positioner\r<br />[youtube]DnQk9kyHqzA[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Lesson 1, presenting two simple stagings...and some bad static noise from a cheap microphone \r<br />[youtube]TUiLIiYdw7s[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />LINKS to some noticeable sets:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3412488/?]fgambler[/url] -[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/images/579841/?go=force_view] Street Fighter TESV - set[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/15479034/?]raccoondance[/url] - [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/images/570366/?go=force_view]Honey Shortage\r<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/6996437/?]BlackMaid [/url]- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/images/584144/?]Coins Coins Coins[/url]   \r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2364420/?]mikie1001421[/url] - [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/images/585037/?]thanks ptc001\r<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5039924/?tb=images&pUp=1]ista3[/url] -[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/images/594595/?go=force_view] Starry[/url]",
