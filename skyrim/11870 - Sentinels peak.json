Problem is, when i first started it, i knew absolutely nothing about the CK. So i think i might have made some mistakes early on which are now ingrained into the core .esp and may cause unknown effects in the worldspace.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve learned a hell of a lot building this mod, so i\\'m gonna keep the interiors, which i still love and totally rebuilt the exterior from the ground up in a fresh .esp probably in a different location, one that\\'s not used by any popular mods, to avoid conflicts.\r\n\r\nThe original idea of the mod was to built a player home for myself to use from the beginning of my next play through... but i\\'ve spent so much time staring at this damn place i don\\'t even really want to use it myself anymore! The next build should be a lot quicker now i know what i\\'m doing, so hopefully i\\'ll still be able to enjoy it myself lol\r\n\r\nanyways, cheers all.. and i\\'ll be back ;-) \r\n\r\n--------\r\n",
