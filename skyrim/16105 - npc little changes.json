  "descriptionHtml": "Description:\r\n\r\nThis mod slightly changes the faces of several NPC\\'s.\r\nThese are (mostly) not big changes, but I think they will make the game more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nAl changes are made with foretrenty\\'s Skyrim NPC editor (see credits at bottom for link).\r\n\r\nEveryone is allowed to use this mod as he/she sees fit, but credits (both to foretrenty and me) are nice.\r\nI also disapprove of using this mod for making money.\r\n\r\nJames2510\r\n\r\n\r\nHelp:\r\n\r\nIt is bugged however. I used the NPC Editor. After I was finished I added all files to a 7zip-archive. Installed with NMM, but when I start the game, it crashes before going to the main menu. It doesn\\'t conflict with any mods installed with NMM (I uninstalled them all).\r\n\r\nI would appreciate it if someone is willing to take a look at these files and search for the problem. I use the latest Skyrim version (which get patched automatically) and the latest version of the NPC Editor. If you need anymore info, just let me know. I will do my best to provide with needed.\r\n\r\nI am not an experienced modder (as you\\'ve most certainly noticed), and this is the first mod ever I am uploading.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\nAela the Huntress:\r\n - removed warpaint\r\n - gave more femine features\r\n\r\nDelphine:\r\n - Changed hair colour from platinum blond to chestnut\r\n\r\nIona:\r\n - raised ayebrows a little\r\n - gave female stance\r\n\r\nJordis:\r\n - gave female stance\r\n\r\nLydia:\r\n - set essential to true\r\n - set level scheme to two-handed\r\n - removed steel sword and added steel greatsword\r\n - changed stance to female\r\n - changed har colour from black to blacktrue (which is darker)\r\n - raised her eyebrows a little bit\r\n - changed eye-colour to dark blue\r\n\r\nMirabelle Ervine:\r\n - Raised eyebrows a lttle bit\r\n - Changed eyecolour from hazel brown to ice blue\r\n\r\nSapphire:\r\n - Changed hair colour from dark brown to blue black\r\n - raised eyebrows a little bit to make her look more stern\r\n\r\nSilda the Unseen:\r\n - lowered eyebrows a bit\r\n - gave her some more feminine facial features\r\n\r\nVex:\r\n - Changed hair colour from bright grey to platinum blond\r\n - changed eye colour from hazel brown to light blue\r\n\r\nYsolda:\r\n - Changed hair style\r\n - Changed eye colour from amber to dark blue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion history:\r\n\r\n - 0.5 initial release\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nBethesda for Skyrim.\r\n\r\nforetrenty for his Skyrim NPC Editor\r\nSkyrim NPC Editor on Skyrim Nexus: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4554",
