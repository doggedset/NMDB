  "descriptionHtml": "Welcome to my unfinished music project. This mod was supposed to replace the theme music of Skyrim with a track that would take you on a journey through the sounds of all the previous Elder Scrolls games, but my hard drive died while working on it so this is all I have left. Watch the video to hear it before install. It may be unfinished, but is still less annoying than the huffing battle cries of nords shouting at you.\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]izkc-kaQiAg[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Install: Just unzip to your Skyrim &#39;Data&#39; folder, then play&#33;\r<br />Uninstall: Remove the file &#39;Data/music/special/mus_maintheme.xwm&#39;\r<br />\r<br />That&#39;s it, just a simple file. I may try to start this project over in the future, but don&#39;t hold your breath.",
