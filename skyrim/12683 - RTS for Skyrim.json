During combat they heal 2pts per second.\r<br />\r<br />Four Militia Squads. You can have all your villagers following you at the same time.\r<br />You can tell your squad members to be essential or killable.\r<br />You can tell them to move out of your way.\r<br />You can tell them to harvest plants while following you. Butterflies and fish collection can be toggled.\r<br />\r<br />New Orders&gt; Assign uniform ------ New Orders&gt; Done assigning uniform.\r<br />\tTo assign a uniform, tell them you have a new uniform, it automatically forgets the old uniform. \r<br />\tThen give them the new armor, then tell them you are done. \r<br />\tA uniform can have upto one bow, one shield and one melee weapon plus other armor and jewelry.\r<br />\t\r<br />If they already have the item, you need to take it and give it back to them.\r<br />If you don&#39;t assign a uniform, they will wear the item(s) you give them.\r<br />If you assign a uniform without a helmet and then later give them a helmet, they will wear the helmet till the next time you change cells.\r<br />If they have a shield assigned as part of their uniform and they equip a different shield, the script will make them switch to the assigned shield. Same for bows and melee weapon.\r<br />If they equip a spell, staff or torch, the script will not force them to change items.\r<br />\r<br />You can have an unlimited number of houses, shelters and workshops.\r<br />* 6 new building types with internal cells\r<br />....You can build 30 of each style for a total of 180 internal cells.\r<br />....You can change the outside appearance of the house after you place it.\r<br />....This will not change the internal cell or the look of the door.\r<br />....Sneak and activate the door to get the menu.\r<br />....3 workshops, 1 tavern\r<br />....Two house styles that you can upgrade to workshops.\r<br />Eight Placeable Fast Travel Markers. \r<br />Bandit Raids.\r<br />Merchants pay a share of their profits to you. 100 gold per day.\r<br />Hire Lumberjacks to work at your Lumbermill.\r<br />--Each Lumberjack will make 800 firewood a day.
