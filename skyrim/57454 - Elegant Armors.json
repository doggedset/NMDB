  "descriptionHtml": "Ever want some elegant armors for your female characters? Feel like the &#34;sexy&#34; variants that are out there are too skimpy? Well, then this is just for you&#33; This mod includes 5 new armors drawn from two different replacement mods: Leather Armor, Iron Armor, Banded Iron Armor and the 2 variants of Steel Armor. Nothing overly skimpy, just a bit more elegant: removed pauldrons on the Leather Armor and revealed belly on the Iron, Banded Iron and Steel Armors. (See pictures for self-explanatory pictures)\r<br />These new armors are all forgable under their original categories (if you don&#39;t get it, you&#39;re not playing the game right). They benefit from the perks offered by the vanilla game, not from any smithing-altering mods so far as I know.\r<br />\r<br />This mods adds standalone variants to the armors replaced in these mods:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32866/?]Lightly revealing Steel and Iron armor for CBBE by [b]WARJOL[/b][/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6975/?]Pauldron-Free Female Leather Armor  by [b]Nexudude[/b][/url]\r<br />All credits and glory go to these two modders, I&#39;m just releasing standalone variants.\r<br />\r<br />Notes: The WARJOL file says &#34;for CBBE&#34;, but it still looks good in my game, which has UNP.\r<br />           If you really want patches for this and other mods (smithing perks etc), don&#39;t bother asking me, I&#39;m not an expert modder.",
