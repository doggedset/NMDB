In any case, here is my most favorite work so far for y&#39;all to enjoy :) \r<br />\r<br />This mod turns [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Frostflow_Lighthouse]Frostflow Lighthouse[/url] (spoilers on that there link for the quest &#34;Frostflow Abyss&#34;) located southeast of the Imperial camp between Dawnstar and Winterhold, into a comfy player home. \r<br />\r<br />You can actually enable the mod without having done the quest [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Frostflow_Abyss_(quest)]Frostflow Abyss[/url], since all the triggers have been left intact and the door simply links to a different cell, instead of the original one. You will be missing on the rewards for the quest, however, so I&#39;d encourage everybody to do the quest beforehand&#33; I included the most interesting loot from the original cell (a Restoration skill book, a torchbug in a jar, and some rare clothes) so you won&#39;t miss them if you go in without having done the quest.\r<br />\r<br />Now, onto the house itself. The mod makes extensive use of custom resources, which explains the size of the file. The reason for this was that this house is a very personal project and I was going for a unique look. Many items are static to avoid going in and causing an explosion if you nudge anything ever so slightly. I designed it with a sort of nautical theme in mind based on my on character&#39;s story; her parents originally lived there, but after they died, my character refused to return until doing Frostflow Abyss. Afterward, her follower turned it into a cozy home for her as a wedding present. I made a reference to this with the book you&#39;ll see by the entrance, which has one of my favorite love poems.\r<br />\r<br />The house has all amenities you may need - all crafting stations (although it has an anvil instead of a forge) including a smelter, enchanting and alchemy tables, display cases, and cooking pot. There are mannequins, bookcases and weapon racks to display your trophies, an attic to store unwanted stuff, plenty of meat ready to harvest, and a bathing room with a bathrub to stay clean if you&#39;re using a mod such as [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29025/?]Drink Eat Sleep Bathe[/url]. I feature a sewing nook because it&#39;s something I am interested in. The alchemy station is rather small compared to enchanting because playing with soul trapping is my character&#39;s husband&#39;s area of interest. I also tried to turn the smelter into a kind of chimney so it would make sense to have it indoors. I think it doesn&#39;t look that bad.\r<br />\r<br />All containers in the house except sacks and barrels are safe and will not respawn. The whole area is fully navmeshed for your companions, too.\r<br />\r<br />izon87604 has also made a wonderful video review for your enjoyment - thank you&#33; (Frostflow Lighthouse starts at 06:12)\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]gQW1zQyBDRs[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />And here&#39;s another beautiful video by EmadWasfi&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]U2UtWjqptWg[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />And a gorgeous video by Hodilton&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]oW1jEFzPzvA[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#39;SteamSteamAppsCommonSkyrimData&#39; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. And if you ever want to uninstall it (but why would you want to do that? ;_;) all the custom content is neatly stored in folders named &#39;Frostflow&#39; in your &#39;meshes&#39; and &#39;textures&#39; folder for easy removal. Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.0b corrects some issues with followers - as the area was not set as public, they&#39;d ask you to leave if the Lighthouse was set as their home. It should be fixed now.\r<br />\r<br />Now, for the credits:\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.amazon.com/The-Captains-Verses-Poems-Directions/dp/081121821X]&#34;The Fickle One&#34;[/url] was written by Pablo Neruda, and translated by Donald D.
