  "summary": "A small ring found in Elgrim\\'s Elixirs that provides a constant 50% Spell Absorption effect when worn. Can be disenchanted.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I wanted a small ring that provided an enchantment that is delightfully overpowered that I can put on something else, but being too lazy to search around for one, I made my own and threw it on the counter of Elgrim\\'s Elixirs in Riften. It\\'s not owned by anybody, and I have no idea if it\\'ll show up anywhere else. Don\\'t expect a professional, serious mod from this, since it\\'s my first.\r\n\r\nApologies if it doesn\\'t download properly through the NMM. If that happens, just install it manually.",
