The boat is invisible and I cant get to the door&#33; Help? \r<br />A. This may happen the first time you travel to the boat, to fix it just save and reload and the boat should appear&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Q. Can I safely store my stuff in the chests without having to worry about losing it? \r<br />A. Yes. Every single container on the boat is completely safe, that includes : chests, sacks barrels and crates. \r<br />\r<br />Q. The door on the upper deck wont work correctly, whats going on? \r<br />A. Im not sure why this is happening. Me and other modders have tried to fix it but to no avail, there isnt any reason why it should work. \r<br />\r<br />Q. The mannequins are scaring me&#33; \r<br />A. Yeah those bloody mannequins never did stay still, unfortunately there is not much I can do to fix it, however this mod should help&#33; \r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php? Id=10652\r<br />\r<br />Q. Can my spouse live with me? \r<br />A. I havent scripted for a spouse to be able to move in. However, with this mod you will be able to have your spouse live with you. \r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php? Id=11370\r<br />\r<br />Q. My followers wont use the teleport statues to and from the asteria? \r<br />A. Again im not sure what is causing this, and am looking into it&#33; But if you enter the interior your follower should teleport inside with you&#33; \r<br />\r<br />&#92;&#92;Installation//\r<br />To install just drag and drop into you data folder, make sure &#39;the asteria - dwemer airship&#39; is checked under &#39;data files&#34; and enjoy&#33; &#33; \r<br />\r<br />&#92;&#92;Uninstallation//\r<br />To uninstall, simple delete &#39;the asteria - dwemer airship&#39; from your data folder, be sure to remove any valubles from the home first otherwise you will lose everything&#33; \r<br />\r<br />&#92;&#92;Version History//\r<br />- v 1. 0 initial release\r<br />- v 1. 0. 1\r<br />- fixed broken door on upper deck\r<br />- v 1. 1\r<br />- added navmesh\r<br />- fixed mannequin (works this time)\r<br />- removed broken weapon plaques from bedroom\r<br />\r<br />My other house mods\r<br />\r<br />-Dragon falls manor\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?
