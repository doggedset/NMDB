This is a simple plugin I made for my latest playthrough. Thought i'd share so other people can benefit. \n<br />\n<br />[u]What is this:[/u] A Patch that allows [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55518/?]Real Road[/url]'s meshes to work with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61995/?]Tamriel Reloaded HD[/url]. You still need both mods. This is just a simple patch that makes them play nice together.\n<br />\n<br />[u]How to install:[/u] Download Mod with mod manager. Install. Activate Mod. Load [b]AFTER [/b][u]Tamriel Reloaded HD.esp[/u] and [u]Real Roads.esp[/u].\n<br />\n<br />[u]Issues:[/u] (Hopefully) None. The plugin is super simple, so it shouldn't conflict with anything. \n<br />\n<br />[u]Merging:[/u] If you need to, you can merge this plugin with Tamriel Reloaded HD.esp. Make sure this plugin OVERWRITES Tamriel Reloaded HD.esp. I still recommend to load it after Real Roads.esp. \n<br />\n<br />That's all. Enjoy. \n<br />[/size]",
