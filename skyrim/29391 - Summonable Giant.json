  "descriptionHtml": "I was playing Skyrim as a mage and I thought it would be awesome if you could summon a giant\r\nSo I created a mod that lets you summon a giant (Costs 75 magicka)\r\n\r\nPositive things:\r\nVery powerfull\r\nLevel 82\r\nCan\\'t die\r\nThey will be permanently with you\r\nIf you have the perk Twin Souls (Not sure but I think it is that one) you can summon up to 2 giants\r\n\r\nNegative things: \r\nCan\\'t summon a Giant in a village like Whiterun etc because of lack of room\r\nThey are too small to fit in dungeons\r\nThey will follow you but you gotta stand back quite far\r\nThey follow you slowly\r\n\r\nFor the new people:\r\n\r\nYou can simply install this mod by putting \\'\\'conjuregiant\\'\\' in C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\The Elder Scrolls V\\\\Data or where your Skyrim directory is located\r\nIf you don\\'t understand that just right click on the desktop shortcut of Skyrim click properties and then open file location\r\nOpen the folder called \\'\\'data\\'\\' and put the file in there\r\n\r\nYou can find this Spell Tome in Breezehome upstairs infront of the bed\r\n\r\nI hope you will enjoy this mod\r\n\r\n~SolidSkyrim",
