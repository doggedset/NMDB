  "descriptionHtml": "I don\\'t know if you are like my friends and I, however when we played Oblivion our favorite arrow in the game was Rose of Sithis. This was for one reason, it was so rare you only got one per game save unless you duped or consoled to get more. Well here it is for Skyrim.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis arrow is able to be crafted at any forge (under misc) given you have the Ebony Smithing perk (as it was an ebony arrow in Oblivion) with the following materials (Item ID corresponding to each item if you want to console the materials to make it):\r\n1x Ebony Ingot                    5AD9D\r\n1x Hawk Feather                 E7ED0\r\n1x Black Soul Gem               2E500\r\n\r\nThe old A Kiss, Sweet mother material version only requires steel smithing as the book might be awkward to come by.\r\n1x Ebony Ingot                    5AD9D\r\n1x Hawk Feather                 E7ED0\r\n1x A Kiss, Sweet Mother      A0322\r\nAltogether making 100 arrows.\r\n\r\nEven though this arrow is ebony I thought it fitting to give it a \\\"little\\\" boost in damage as it is from the Dark Brotherhood it does 32 damage and I set the noise to silent (not sure if it works as I haven\\'t tested it in depth yet.) so you will not be noticed as easily when sneaking around shooting people in the face.  All flight characteristics remain unchanged from the vanilla Skyrim arrows.\r\n\r\nI would also like to thank Nicoroshi for helping me fix a major texture issue I was having and motivating me to re attempt this project without his help I would have just given up and hoped someone else put this arrow out. So thank you again Nico if you read this.\r\n\r\nAlso anyone knowing how I could add Mehrunes\\' Razor magic effect to give this arrow a chance to one shot kill (for another version I will upload) please let me know what steps or procedure I should take to make that happen.",
