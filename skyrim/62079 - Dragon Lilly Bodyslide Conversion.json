It is a set of BodySlide 2 outfit sliders for that mod. It requires the original mod - it does not include any meshes, textures, or .esp from the original mod.  \r<br />It was built around the CBBE Body HDT found in CBBE v3.3.\r<br />\r<br />The original mod can be found at: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62045/?\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />Bodyslide 2 (v2.2 or later)\r<br />The original mod, linked above\r<br />A working CBBE + HDT compatible body with extended XP32 skeleton\r<br />\r<br />Usage: \r<br />Extract this file into your Skyrim folder, or use Nexus Mod Manager.  When you next run Bodyslide 2, the new outfits should be listed; Sliders are included for the Dress and the armlets. Just type &#34;Lill&#34; into the Outfit Filter and they should show up when you hit Batch Build.\r<br />\r<br />Disclaimers:\r<br />\r<br />While I did check all sliders for clipping using Outfit Studio, I will not guarantee an absence of clipping if extreme settings or combinations of extreme settings are used. :D  I will guarantee if you use a CBBE Classic preset with a setnpcweight of 40, you shouldn&#39;t see any. :D  \r<br />\r<br />I use CBBE HDT, if you use just BBP or TBBP (non-HDT); I can&#39;t guarantee it will work for you.\r<br />\r<br />I did nothing to the boots and/or the High Heels functionality.\r<br />\r<br />Known Issues:\r<br />\r<br />Credits and thanks:\r<br />-Caliente for CBBE, Bodyslide, and Outfit Studio\r<br />-betterbecause for the original mod\r<br />-Optiuq for the original source mod\r<br />\r<br />Permissions:\r<br />Please feel free to use this as a base if someone wants to do a (T)BBP conversion or some such.",
