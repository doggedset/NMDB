  "summary": "A small, yet important mod for people that love playing with Beast Races, that are downright annoyed because of the lack of proper helmets!",
  "descriptionHtml": "[color=Goldenrod]Introduction[/color]\r\n\r\nHave you ever gotten tired of playing with you\\'re argonian and every time you equip a helmet you\\'re amazing horns just disappear? And then tried using helmet hiding mods just to hide your OWN, but leading to hiding every single helmet in existence!? I did, so, much....\r\n\r\nIn my eyes, Bethesda failed greatly on this part. The Beast Races are the most awesome and beautifully done in the last three games, and then they forget to make proper helmets for them....\r\n\r\nThat\\'s why I decided to make this mod. Simple, yet needed! This mod will allow you to fully hide you\\'re helmet and still get the bonuses and perks that you desperately need, without losing your horns/ears. And it will also prevent everyone else in the world from hiding their helmets as well!\r\n\r\n[color=Darkred]Please, don\\'t forget to endorse the file if you enjoy it. By endorsing you are giving me more motivation to release more mods in the future. :)[/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=Goldenrod]Installation[/color]\r\n\r\n> I fully recommend using the NMM(Nexus Mod Manager) to download and install this mod.\r\n\r\n[color=Goldenrod]Compatibility[/color]\r\n\r\n> This mod SHOULD be compatible with any other mod, probably except with mods that also try  to do the same thing.\r\n\r\n> This mod includes zero scripts so no need to worry about FPS loss or anything.\r\n\r\n> Remember that this mod only affects vanilla helmets and will not affect helmets added by mods. I however, Intend to make compatibility patches for them in the future!\r\n\r\n> If you\\'re using Skyrim Redone, don\\'t forget to run the Reproccer to make sure the new helmets have the correct stats.\r\n\r\n[color=Goldenrod]Features[/color]\r\n\r\n> Nearly all Vanilla helmets Done. Also Includes Dawnguard and Dragonborn DLC\\'s.\r\n\r\n>All helmets are craftable and upgradable; \r\n----->To Upgrade the helmets, you still need the required Perks.\r\n----->All the finished Helmets are inside the Hide category so you can turn them invisible right on the start of the game.\r\n\r\n>You can craft these helmets by having the original one and a Spriggan Sap.  I thought it made sense since Spriggans can go invisible, therefore using their sap to make the helmets invisible as well, plus a bit of challenge to make them. Or simply talk to Arcadia I guess. :P;\r\n\r\n>All DragonPriest masks done! You can now use masks on you\\'re beast races without them looking really weird....\r\n\r\n[color=Goldenrod]Planned Features[/color]\r\n\r\n>Compatibility patches for some of the big armor mods\r\n\r\n[color=Goldenrod]Known Issues[/color]\r\n\r\n>None at the moment.\r\n\r\n[color=Goldenrod]Can you expect further work from me?[/color]\r\n\r\nYes! I\\'m not new to modding, although this is the FIRST mod I\\'m releasing to the public, I\\'ve made several mods for my own personal use, not to mention also for friends since Oblivion. But I\\'ve been working on a quest mod which I hope to release in the nearby future. Keep you\\'re eyes open if you\\'re interested. ;)\r\n\r\n[color=Goldenrod]Permissions[/color]\r\n\r\nYou are not allowed to do anything with my work. Don\\'t upload it anywhere. Don\\'t convert or use my files and don\\'t modify anything.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to use my mod for something, please contact me first so we can discuss about it.\r\n\r\n[color=Goldenrod]Credits[/color]\r\n\r\nThanks to Besthesda for such a great and awesome game. Even though you forgot the helmets, you\\'re game is still fantastic nonetheless! :)",
