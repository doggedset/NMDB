  "descriptionHtml": "The mighty Buster Sword&#33; \r<br />Crusher of spines, and dismemberer of limbs&#33; \r<br />\r<br />4,600+ subscribes on Steam\r<br />LOCATION: Crushed into a stone at the bridge by the farm around Whiterun. \r<br />\r<br />This is the sequel to my &#34;Toon Buster Sword&#34; mod, and is of the original basic form. \r<br />The Buster Sword is very powerful, having a long reach and 100 base damage. \r<br />It is 25 weight units, and is craftable and temperable (steel smithing required to forge) \r<br />The textures are CUSTOM. \r<br />The Buster Sword&#39;s ID is xx000D63 (xx = load order #) \r<br />\r<br />UPDATED: \r<br />There are now (technically) four different versions of this sword in the game. \r<br />The original, held like a greatsword. \r<br />The original, held like a battleaxe/warhammer. \r<br />The weaker version, held like a greatsword. \r<br />The weaker version, held like a battleaxe/warhammer. \r<br />ALL FOUR ARE CRAFTABLE AND TEMPERABLE. \r<br />\r<br />YES. The &#34;LOW&#34; version (indicated by a (L) after the name) does not entirely fit into the hand. This requires a remodel, which also requires a retexture. The remodeling is easy, the retexturing sucks. So it is on the lower end of my list of mods to tweak. Also, please be aware that I accept requests. On top of the requests I get, there&#39;s also my girlfriend who I need to spend more time with, I am in college for graphic design, I am in the middle of several projects, and I am also job-hunting. So I adore and work better with your patience. Thank you all for being so awesome. \r<br />\r<br />This is the second buster sword of several I&#39;m making. \r<br />The &#34;fusion sword&#34; that resembles this buster will be created soon. \r<br />It is going to have all 7 parts that assemble into one Buster. \r<br />Yes, it will indeed look badass. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Many of the answers you&#39;re probably going to ask have been answered in my Steam comments.\r<br />If you don&#39;t have Steam, still feel free to ask&#33;\r<br />I&#39;ll make a random video of me slaughtering Solitude with it soon. \r<br />Also on Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=235068169\r<br />******************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />Keep up with me&#33;\r<br />YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/IKoltonBurkeI \r<br />facebook: https://www.facebook.com/KyzertheShadowyt \r<br />twitter: https://twitter.com/KyzertheShadow \r<br />Deviantart: http://koltonrburke.deviantart.com/ \r<br />Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/id/koltonburke/",
