  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5]RoleplayingGoals[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]TL;DR[/size]\n<br />\n<br />More stuff for you to do when you roleplay!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />I am consistently amazed by all of the thought and care that goes into the\n<br />making of so many great mods, by so many talented people. I\n<br />may not have the same skill for coding and modding that some of you do, but I\n<br />did want to give something back to the community in some way. So, Thank you all,\n<br />and I hope you get some use out of my small contribution.\n<br />\n<br />Do you enjoy roleplaying in Skyrim, but find that you quickly run out of things\n<br />to do that make sense for your character?\n<br /> That's why I created [i]Goals for Roleplaying[/i].Inside you'll find 11 different character \n<br />archetypes to roleplay as. Each has severalÂ  flavorful lore-friendly objectives \n<br />to complete. They are presented in an interactive checklist format\n<br />and each goal includes a little flavor text to get you inspired. There is also\n<br />a list of restricted actions for each archetype, to make the experience more\n<br />challenging. Feel free to use whichever goals or restrictions make sense to\n<br />you, and add your own to make your roleplay as fun as possible.\n<br />\n<br />If anyone would like to use the content contained within this document for\n<br />other mods, quest creation, or whatever, please go ahead and do\n<br />so, just remember reference me and give me credit. Thanks. Also, I do not own\n<br />any of the artwork in this document, images are taken from screenshots and\n<br />concept art of Skyrim, which is owned by Bethesda Softworks. Nor have created,\n<br />or assisted in the creating of any of the mods mentioned in this document. If\n<br />you are a creator of any of the aforementioned and are dissatisfied with this\n<br />work, contact me and I will make the appropriate changes. So please nobody sue\n<br />me.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Enjoy!",
