  "descriptionHtml": "[color=yellow]Journal Mod[/color]\r<br />This short-story mod features the journal of Jastheria, a Redguard Expatriate and con woman.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffe599][u][b]The journal sits on the hearth in the Sleeping Giant Inn at Riverwood.[/b][/u] [/color]\r<br />\r<br />The first entry is titled [color=#00ffff]&#39;Forgeries, Cleavage, and the Bloody Thalmor.&#39;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[i][size=3][b]&#34;I’ll say this for your average Nord. Even at the depths of their most drunken haze, they usually understand that ‘No’ means ‘No.’\r<br />Etienne, however, was no Nord. Nor was he truly drunk. I’d seen him drunk, and he never got that loud....&#34;[/b][/size][/i][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]ADULT CONTENT&#33;[/color] It&#39;s not insanely explicit, but you might want to minimize the screen if someone walks in. ;-)\r<br />\r<br />If you liked the story, then please endorse&#33; It&#39;s really the only feedback I get as to how well the work was received. If there&#39;s enough demand, I might do more&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]INSTALLATION:[/color]\r<br />Use the mighty Nexus Mod Manager.\r<br />OR&#33;\r<br />Drop the ESP into your DATA folder.\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE NOTE: This mod ONLY adds the journal. Jastheria herself is not part of this mod.\r<br />--The journal respawns on the normal timer.\r<br />\r<br />ALSO NOTE: If you run across typos or other errors, let me know. I didn&#39;t run this through the usual rounds of editors, since those mercenaries always want money for their work. How dare they?? ;-)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]UNSINTALL:[/color]\r<br />Delete the ESP from your DATA folder.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]SAVEGAMES[/color]\r<br />Two saves are available.\r<br />\r<br />Both saves start with Jastheria freshly arrived in Riverwood. She&#39;s still level 1 with a bit of sneak and lockpicking.\r<br />\r<br />The first save is Jastheria with the main questline ENABLED. In my stories, Jastheria is not the Dragonborn, but this is your safest mod, since I don&#39;t know what long-term effects disabling the main questline has.\r<br />\r<br />The second save is Jastheria with the first act of the main questline COMPLETED (so you can buy Breezhome, etc...). You&#39;re supposed to talk to Delphine to continue the quest line. As long as you don&#39;t ask her about the Thalmor, she&#39;ll still run the Sleeping Giant Inn, you&#39;ve got the key to her secret room, and you&#39;re right about where my story will pick back up, if I write more.\r<br />\r<br />WARNING: I have no idea what force-completing the first act might break out there in the world. I strongly recommend just using the first save with the main quest enabled, and just don&#39;t follow up on it if you want to play Jastheria as &#39;canon&#39;.\r<br />\r<br />Both saves have her equipped with a fair amount of loot from her time in Solitude. Her actual adventuring gear is stuff I picked up in Helgen when I made the save. Story-wise, Delphine gave her some salvaged gear to get her started on the road to Riverwood.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: Both saves are pretty clean. Please see the credits below for the list of mods that will keep Jastheria looking as gorgeous as her screenshots. If you don&#39;t use those mods, she&#39;ll still look pretty damn good, but will be different, obviously.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]SAVE INSTALLS:[/color]\r<br />To install, drop the .ESS into your Skyrim saves directory. This is usually at:\r<br />Documents&#92;my games&#92;Skyrim&#92;Saves\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]SAVE UNINSTALLS:[/color]\r<br />Delete the .ESS files.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]FUTURE BUILD:[/color]\r<br />I envision Jastheria as an unarmored melee sneak. She starts out using light armor but switches to cloth when her Alteration gets to the Mage Armor level. And, while she doesn&#39;t know any magic by the end of my first story, Delphine teaches her a thing or two, and she will eventually master Illusions and Alteration.\r<br />\r<br />For combat she prefers to dual wield. She&#39;ll sneak in, open with an assassination, then swap to swords (or axes or maces) and get to work. Using illusions, she never fights alone. She&#39;ll sow as much confusion as possible with AE Fury and Fear, preferably before she&#39;s discovered.\r<br />\r<br />And, of course, she&#39;s a first-class con woman. She can talk anyone into anything.\r<br />\r<br />It would seem Nexus doesn&#39;t like IGN&#34;s insanely long build links. So, here&#39;s a quick breakdown:\r<br />\r<br />Alteration - Whole tree except dual cast.\r<br />Illusion - Whole tree except dual cast.\r<br />One hand - Everything except the weapon-specific talents. Pick one of those, if you wish.\r<br />Sneak - 1/5 Stealth, Backstab, Deadly Aim, Assassin&#39;s Blade. No other talents.\r<br />Lockpicking - Tree trunk up to Master Locks. Branch into Quick Hands, Golden Touch, and Treasure Hunter.\r<br />Speech - Whole tree.\r<br />Enchanting - Whole tree except Soul Squeezer and Soul Siphon.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]ABOUT THE AUTHOR:[/color]\r<br />I&#39;m a professional writer and avid gamer, currently working full time for a miniatures wargame company as their head writer.
