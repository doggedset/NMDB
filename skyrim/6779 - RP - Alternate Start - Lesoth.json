  "modName": "RP - Alternate Start - Lesoth",
  "summary": "A different start that has you playing as Lesoth, a Nord archer/bandit. No active quests and begins only with ragged clothes. Lesoth starts with improved archery and sneak, but besides that he is free to customize as you see fit. ***NOTE*** Carry weight is 200.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is an alternate take on Skyrim. In this world you are not the dragonborn. There is no main questline. Lesoth starts out with just rags, nothing else. All stats are beginner except for archery and sneak, which are both set to 25. The story of Lesoth is completely decided by the player. PLEASE NOTE that this save disables fast travel and sets carryweight to 200. This is purely to improve immersion but can be easily changed with the console if you get tired of walking everywhere. \r\n\r\n\r\n<<Story>>\r\nYou play as Lesoth, a Nord bandit who arrives in Skyrim at the Solitutde docks. After a botched raid in Morrowind, Lethos was captured and put on a prison barge heading towards Solitude. There, Lesoth was set to be sold to the Empire to be put to death. However, as civil war broke out in Skyrim, the Empire deemed Lesoth\\'s execution irrelevant and did not pay for him. So, Lesoth was left at the Solitude docks with nothing but rags and not a single gold coin to his name.  Now, you get to decide what will happen to Lesoth. Will he give up his life of crime or go back to the bandit life? Will he join the Imperial Legion or the Stormcloaks?\r\n\r\n***NOTE***\r\nThe game will still act as if Helgen was destroyed and if you go there, it\\'s kind of buggy so I would just stay away.\r\n\r\nv2 Changes\r\nFixed Carryweight\r\nFast Travel may be possible, I don\\'t know because I have it disabled in my Skyrim pref. file\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod so feel free to give suggestions and criticism. \r\n",
