  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds 3 new Argonian themed armor sets based on the standard Dragonscale and Dragonplate armors, as well as 6 new craftable dragon hoods and 4 craftable versions of the jagged crown . All have their own custom-made HD textures and normal maps. All items in the set are standalone, craftable items and will not replace any existing items. You will need the Dragon Armor Perk to craft all items in this MOD. All items work with all races and both genders.\r\nThe Hist Resin needed for The Hist Armors can be purchased at Belethor\\'s General Goods and from Madesi the Argonian street vendor in Riften. You can purchase all the Hist Dragon armors from Madesi in Riften. You can purchase all the new Dragonscale items from Belethor in Whitrun.\r\n\r\n--------CONFLICT NOTE---------If you have my Hist Dragon Armor Set 2.0 from Steam. They are essentially the same mod only with a different file name and this one has updated HD textures. If you do have my Hist armor mod from steam running along with this one it could cause a conflict. All you have to do is unsubscribe from my steam mod and delete the esp and bfa files from your data folder then rename the new files from this mod to match the files you deleted and you should have no problems. You should not lose any armors you made with the steam mod and they will have new HD textures the next time you play. \r\n\r\n------!!!!NOW WITH LIGHT ARMOR VERSION!!!!------\r\n---------------- !!!!
