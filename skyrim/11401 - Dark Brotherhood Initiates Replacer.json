  "modName": "Dark Brotherhood Initiates Replacer",
  "summary": "Because those two generic assassins were just too mainstream !",
  "descriptionHtml": "Attention, this mod is for those who have already completed the Dark Brotherhood Quests !\r\n\r\nORIGINAL CHARACTERS:\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod and it basically replaces the two Dark Brotherhood Initiates that you can find inside the Dawnstar Sanctuary. I have changed their names, appearence, clothes and items, but they still follow you around and have their original voices. I have also changed them to non-essential, so they can be killed now.\r\n\r\nNord Male => Dark Elf Male, Jokyr Urden\r\nNord Female => Nord Female, Brianna\r\n\r\nSince I never liked the Shrouded Armor, I gave them the Shrouded Robes, which look way better. However, for some reason, they still have the Shrouded Armor Set in their inventory, so consider it as a gift, take it and they will wear the robes. They no longer have the Ebony Dagger, instead they are equipped with Daedric Dagger, Ebony Bow and 100 Ebony Arrows.\r\n\r\nBugs: Well, for some reason, the Creation Kit doesn\\'t correctly saves tattoos and body tint colors. I have tried some ways to bypass this error. However, the most effective method ( used in this file ) still presents some issues on Jokyr neck ( visible in the screenshots ). If someone knows how to fix this, I would be very pleased to know.\r\n\r\nTo install, you just need to put the Texture folder inside your Data folder together with Jokyr.esp and Brianna.esp\r\nInside the Texture folder you will find Actors--Character--FaceGenData--FaceTint--Skyrim.esm\r\nAnd inside the Skyrim.esm folder you will find four files that are required for the NPCs face colors to work properly.\r\nThen you just need to select Jokyr.esp and Brianna.esp in your Data Folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUESTED CHARACTERS:\r\n\r\nAt the time, I have made two other replacements that were requested by some users at the commentary section. To install them, just follow the same steps from the my original characters : Texture folder and esp. file inside the Skyrim/Data folder, and select the esp. file at the launcher.\r\n\r\nOBS : So far, since I\\'m new on this, you won\\'t be able to have many characters at the same time. You can only have one male and one female. For example, both Jokyr ( My original character ) and Gogron ( My first requested character ) replace the DBInitiate01, so you will have to choose wich one you want. The same goes to the females, that all replace the DBInitiate02.\r\n\r\nSo far done characters : \r\n\r\nGogron gro-Bolmog\r\nAmber\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUESTS:\r\n\r\nIf you have any requests, you may write it at the commentary section ! But, beware ... I\\'m new on this, knowing just the basics of the Creation Kit. But if you still wanna give me a try, it would be cool if you could write how you want your character to be, his/her items, essential or not, and more. It would also help me if there was an NPC from Skyrim that your character should be similar, so I could inspire my work on something ! \r\n\r\n\r\nAny bugs, questions, and doubts, just send me a message !\r\nTo use my mod, you must ask me first !\r\nHave fun !",
