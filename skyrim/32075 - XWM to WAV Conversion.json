I am coming out of my hiatus from posting mods, and have decided to \r<br />consolidate my efforts for my new releases. Thanks to everyone&#39;s kind words and support. -&#33;-[/color]\r<br />\r<br />This file is a package of the executables typically already on Windows PCs needed to convert WAV and XWM files, along with a readme. Please use caution when uploading your conversions to Nexus, as copyright laws can be tricky, and I am not looking to get anyone banned.\r<br />\r<br />Credit for the included software to the original owners/creators.",
