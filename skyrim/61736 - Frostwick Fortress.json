  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6]FROSTWICK FORTRESS[/size][size=1](Name Pending)\r<br />\r<br />[/size]This is a small fortress located in the mountains just south of Riverwood. It has no interior areas right now but it will if I continue tinkering with this. Forstwick Fortress is a creation mainly made out of boredom but I am kind of taking a liking to it. Here are the features as of right now....\r<br />\r<br />1/22/2015\r<br />\r<br />Fixed a couple small bugs including that annoying falmer cave mesh in the thieves tunnel. Should all look prim and proper now.\r<br />\r<br />1/17/15.2 Most recent but not so massive update (Notice the smaller typeface)\r<br />[size=2]I now have a lot more storage in the fort. Added a bunch of misc. barrels, and some labeled containers for food and junk\r<br />I also now have an escape tunnel located next to the prison cell.Â [/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]1/17/15.1 Massive Update[/size]\r<br />[size=3]I have added an entire interior area to the inside of the fortress. I would describe the inside as being 90 percent done. I say 90 percent, because lets face it, it&#39;s got more bugs than a 10 dollar motel. None ofthe displays are working properly, so those are visible but nothing can be added to them. There is also the problem with some of the items I used as &#34;props&#34; to decorate the place, showing their names ingame (ex, Iron sword) making it appear as though you could pick them up, which you cannot. They are basically a static mesh, meaning they cant be moved. Are they really really heavy, or have the gods deemed you not worthy of moving them? I dont know. (Not an actual bug, just a bit of false advertising) I also have a tiny bit more work to do on the ramparts, bu all in all, this baby is completed..... For now.\r<br />\r<br />1/17/15 Not so massive update (Notice the smaller typeface)\r<br />I now have a lot more storage in the fort. Added a bunch of misc. barrels, and some labeled containers for food and junk\r<br />I also now have an escape tunnel located next to the prison cell. (I know what you&#39;re thinking, but whats the worst that could happen?) This when entered will do two things depending on which version you use. It will...\r<br />\r<br />A.Dump you straight outside in skyrim outside the fort and down the hill\r<br />   or\r<br />B.Take you into a cave (No loadscreen, it&#39;s the same cell) which leads to a secret thievery room. Has some more storage for the shadier type characters, or maybe it&#39;s just a place to get away from that husband or wife.\r<br />\r<br />I would consider both of these beta and I want to hear back from people who use them. I had some strange framerate issues with this version, but it&#39;s most likely in my end.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=4]Still to do\r<br />[/size]Fix those super fly weapon racks and mannequins (&lt;-- Speeled that write on me furst try)\r<br />[s]Add more storage. Like way more. As of now I really only have weapons, armor and misc chests.[/s]\r<br />Dress the table on the ramparts. Right now it looks pretty nekkid.\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Details-[/size]\r<br />\r<br />   -Multiple tents for you or followers (right now only one has a bed in it)\r<br />   -Bunks inside for sleeping. (Also gives you so much more room for activities)\r<br />   -A kitchen and mess hall\r<br />   -A small prison and a jailers desk\r<br />   -An officers tent with a reeeally cool writing desk and some storage for your finely polished officers cuff links\r<br />   -Workbench, grinding wheel, and anvil. You need a place to make and maintain your weapons. This is a fortress after all\r<br />   -Tanning racks? Hell no, what do you think this is? A holiday inn?\r<br />   -A great room for chillin\r<br />   -An armory worth fillin\r<br />   -A training room for killin\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I will continue this if people like it enough, or if I decide I like it enough. Shoot me any requests on what you think I should have in the fort and I could probably make it happen.",
