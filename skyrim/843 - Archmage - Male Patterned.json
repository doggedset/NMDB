This includes a custom hood texture as well.\r\n\r\nThe white fur can get blown out a bit if the bloom is too high on very sunny days, if this becomes an issue let me know and I will darken it some.\r\n\r\nSome other variants I\\'ve made can be found at http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=766\r\n\r\nI\\'d like to do a female version of all of them but do not have the time until after the holidays.\r\n\r\nEnjoy\r\n\r\n  -Ludovico",
