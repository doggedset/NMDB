  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#daa520][i][b][size=4][font=lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif]TheMinBlack\\'s Armor Shop for SevenBase Bombshell w/BBP[/font][/size][/b][/i][/color]\r\n \r\nThis release has updated [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19004][b]TheMinBlack\\'s Armorshop[/b][/url] to be compatible with the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36992][b]SevenBase[/b][/url] Bombshell Body. It uses some updated meshes that I created along with some of TheMinBlack\\'s original meshes to bring the set more into line with current Skyrim modding standards. It also has several texture resources from the incredible Cabal120\\'s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24909][b]Book of Silence[/b][/url]. To ensure the armor is as high detail as possible if you do not already have Cabal\\'s wonderful work installed.\r\n\r\nAll usage and modification of resources available in this package has been done with the full permission of their respective authors, except in the case of meshes I created in of which I had TheMinBlack\\'s permission to update the set with a few changes if I felt the need.\r\n\r\n[color=#daa520][i][b][font=lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif]Installation:[/font][/b][/i][/color]\r\n \r\nSimply install with Nexus Mod Manager, the package contains all the required resources.\r\n\r\nIf you have Cabal120\\'s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24909][b]Book of Silence[/b][/url] installed, this package will ask to overwrite texture assets already present, you can tell it no, or yes, its largely up to you, the textures themselves will not be changed either way. \r\n\r\nAfter installation, ensure the four plugin files are present in your load order and activated, and as a suggestion ensure you move them into place with your other armor plugins, you can place them fairly high in your load order as they do not replace any armors and aren\\'t very important in your load order priority.\r\n\r\n[color=#daa520][i][b][font=lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif]Usage:[/font][/b][/i][/color]\r\n\r\nThis is packaged as a stand-alone set of armors, meaning all the armors must be created at a forge. Nothing about the crafting recipes or armor stats have been changed from the originals. If you want a companion to use the armor you will have to forge it and give it to them, pretty simple stuff.\r\n\r\nThe choice to go with the stand alone package was to ensure these armors did not overwrite mesh replacers for their respective armor material types that users might prefer to use in place of base Skyrim armors.\r\n\r\n[color=#daa520][font=lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif][i][b]Stuff you might care about:[/b][/i][/font][/color]\r\n \r\n[color=#ff0000][b]Q:[/b][/color] [b]The leather part of the Ancient Nord Skirt clips a tiny bit forward when walking/running.[/b]\r\n \r\n[color=#00ff00][b]A:[/b] [/color][i]Yes I know, believe it or not I had this entire set done in two days then spent two weeks faffing about with that element alone trying to get it to weight out right to move fluidly and perfectly...what I\\'ve achieved is about as good as its going to get with as small an element as the skirt tends to be and how the thighs pull the material itself. Suffice it to say its still about 100% better than several of my mind numbingly frustrating revamps of the skirt that were attempting to add more mesh to the element so it wouldn\\'t clip at all. Its not a bad issue overall and everything moves right so..more or less I consider it as good as I can get it to the best of my ability. If someone wants the FBX file for the skirt cause they\\'re a better weight painter than me...feel free to PM me and ask for it cause this mesh addition has kinda driven me nuts the last couple weeks trying to get it perfect.[/i]\r\n\r\n[b][font=lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif][i][color=#daa520]Other Stuff:[/color][/i][/font][/b]\r\n \r\nThe original mash up meshes for this mod are done by TheMinBlack, all I\\'ve really done here is fit the sets and add/remove some bits and pieces that were problematic (and create a problem of my own along the way) or needed updating. The assets are all based off original Bethesda meshes.\r\n\r\n[font=lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif][color=#daa520][b][i]Permissions:[/i][/b][/color][/font]\r\n \r\n[b]The assets in this mod were created/used with the full permission of the original author(s). As I am not the original author of the models or textures, please do not contact me for permissions to convert or use the armor in any other mod.[/b]\r\n \r\n[i][font=lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif][b][color=#daa520]Credits:[/color][/b][/font][/i]\r\n \r\n[b]Sevennity[/b] for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36992][b]SevenBase Bombshell[/b][/url]\r\n[b]TheMinBlack[/b] for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19004][b]TheMinBlack\\'s ArmorShop.[/b][/url]\r\n[b]Cabal120[/b] for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24909][b]The Book of Silence[/b][/url]\r\n[b]Bethesda Softworks[/b] for the original meshes.\r\n \r\n[b]The SevenBase Team: [/b]\r\nSevennity\r\nCrosscrusade\r\nDemonHunter1986\r\nWast1980\r\n \r\nThanks for all their work on [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36992/?][b]SevenBase[/b] [/url]so far.",
