  "descriptionHtml": "[b]This is my first mod I have deemed good enough to release onto the nexus, I appreciate constructiveÂ criticism, but please do not be rude if you find a flaw or something you do not like.\r<br />\r<br />NEW VERSION HERE, NEXUS DID NOT WANT TO UPDATE THE FILE :(\r<br />\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58807/?tab=1&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D58807%26preview%3D&pUp=1\r<br />\r<br />[size=6]LARGE UPDATE COMING&#33;\r<br />[/size][size=4]It will have farm, several optional files of relocated house, and medium basement with crafting stations&#33; (Maybe farm will have crafting stations too)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[/b]I saw many other house mods so large and grand, why not a small comfortable one? It is not very functional, but it has named storages, and there is a very very big update coming, Attakyabin is a small and warm feeling cabin found in the snowier pine area of Skyrim, there is currently no quest to obtain it, you just fast travel to it and open the door, it is yours from start of game, the fireplace and candle on the table provide warm illumination for the house, while it may be a small space, it still has some functionality, though&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Features are:\r<br />\r<br />A lot of named storage, so you can store all of your item&#33;\r<br />\r<br />A bed.\r<br />\r<br />Warm feel to the interior\r<br />\r<br />Plenty of clutter in a cozy way\r<br />\r<br />Good spot for doing posing sometimes",
