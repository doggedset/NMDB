  "summary": "Tower in the style of Raven Rock buildings, edited DLC2 building mesh, resource only",
  "descriptionHtml": "I have been working on a mod for Solstheim that&#39;s taking awhile. I figure somebody might get some use out of this tower in the meantime, though. The original Bloodmoon DLC for Morrowind had a Raven Rock with silos, which seems to be where they got some of the inspiration for Dragonborn&#39;s non-Redoran Raven Rock buildings. I&#39;ve never liked the lack of variety in architecture in Raven Rock and wanted to mix it up a bit by reintroducing the original silos. \r<br />\r<br />The file contains a single mesh which was edited down from one of the Dragonborn meshes (via NifSkope). Collision geometry has been added (ChunkMerge). I&#39;ve tested it in game but not extensively. Please let me know if you encounter issues so I can try to correct them.\r<br />\r<br />This is a resource only. You&#39;ll have to add the mesh in via the CK. One of the screenshots shows a door frame and door, but it&#39;s not part of the mesh. That way you can add whatever door you like, or no door at all if you prefer.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.0 works fine, but I forgot to include the material types. Symptom would be whacking the tower with a stick and you&#39;d get no sound. Version 1.1 corrects that. If you&#39;ve already installed 1.0, you can overwrite it with 1.1 since they use the same file names. Version 1.2 is the same tower, except I&#39;ve centered it on the origin. The original versions were offset which made them harder to work with. Placement and handling of 1.2 should be a little easier. Same installation instructions as the original but it uses a different file name. Pasting it in over the original would probably mess up placement of any reference currently in use. You can always rename if to the original filename if you like.",
