Believe me, I tried for hours and hours to make a Chameleon on contact enchant but it did not work. \r<br />\r<br />IMPORTANT: The arrows need to be fired at the feet of large enemies in order to work. Same goes for netches, aim at where they hover. And if enemies are in a group one arrow will kill them all since I had to add an explosion to get them to work. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Requirements: \r<br />Skyrim \r<br />Update \r<br />Dragonborn DLC Obviously. \r<br />\r<br />Also Available on Steam:\r<br />http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=286432658\r<br />\r<br />Credits: \r<br />\r<br />ghosu for the meshes and textures used for Ring of Raven Eye \r<br />\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49864/? \r<br />\r<br />747823 for the meshes and textures used for Shadowsting \r<br />\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3871/? \r<br />\r<br />DARKF0X127 for the helpful tutorial on enchanted arrows. \r<br />\r<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Huf1GcDXwfw ",
