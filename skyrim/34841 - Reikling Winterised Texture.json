  "descriptionHtml": "Although this is not quite lore friendly in the fact that Reiklings are infact a deep blue colour, I did not like the look of them as since Dawnguard, the vanilla Falmer I know and play as sometimes does not fit in as well as I personally like to.\r\n\r\nEspecially as I was playing as a Snow Elf guy and decided to join the Thirsk Reikling Tribe, having a blue smurf posse hang-ten with me with my Falmer bretheren felt a bit... odd.\r\n\r\nSo I opened uo the .bsa archives, opened up the retexturer and did this with some retexturing of the eyes also so that they are more Snow elf-ish.\r\n\r\nIt is nothing special, just a retexture.
