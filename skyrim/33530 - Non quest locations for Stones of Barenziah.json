  "descriptionHtml": "It is weird, that you must do some quest, join faction or even buy house to get all Stones of Barenziah. This roleplay game, so game should&#39;t to force you to do it. \r<br />\r<br />I moved locations of three Barenziah Stones to near orginal places. WARNING&#33; contain spoilers of four stones locations \r<br />\r<br />Stone from Dark Brotherhood sanctuary is moved to Jarl&#39;s house in Falkreath \r<br />Stone from Arc Mages quarter is moved to jarl&#39;s house in Winterhold \r<br />Stone from buyable house Proudspire Manor is moved to Bard&#39;s College \r<br />\r<br />Stone in Thalmor Embassy is already moved by Unofficial Skyrim mod to cave under Embassy, so I didn&#39;t touched that one. Recommend to download it, if you don&#39;t want to continue Main Quest. \r<br />\r<br />Enjoy \r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/414285]gnarly1[/url] made [i]&#34;Prowler&#39;s Profit - Immersive Clues to the Stones of Barenziah&#34;[/i], where you search them with clues, and he made compatible patch too for this mod. I recommend to use it.\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59475/?",
