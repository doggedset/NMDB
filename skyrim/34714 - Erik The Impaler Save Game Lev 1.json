Level One, no cheats. Erik is a Nord, so climb down the ladder, enter the fort, and have some fun. Dont forget to check every container. \r\n[URL=http://s1055.photobucket.com/user/lycanheart/media/9f19abd9-89ab-4abb-a0e9-748bf06b47ba_zps54909c3e.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1055.photobucket.com/albums/s502/lycanheart/9f19abd9-89ab-4abb-a0e9-748bf06b47ba_zps54909c3e.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\nThis mod requires Random Alternate Start by Syclonixy http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25404,, what a wonderful mod. I used SKSE, this may be needed. For Warpints i have used the very wonderful Battle Hardened Warpaints by Diethardt and netherwalk, if i needed permission to use them, then im sorry, guess ill have to be spanked, lol. \r\nCovereyes by mrLenski \r\nErik has that almost bald look, but in case your game crashes, i do have Apachii hairs on.  Hope this is not an issue\r\n\r\nNOTE#\r\nIf i have forgotten anything, please forgive me, my illness makes me forgetful, and my  meds make me oooo look a shiny thing.\r\n\r\n[URL=http://s1055.photobucket.com/user/lycanheart/media/erik3_zps05e2c5b2.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1055.photobucket.com/albums/s502/lycanheart/erik3_zps05e2c5b2.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\r\nFort Snowhawk is a military fort located just west of Morthal. The fort has a courtyard and two interior zones: Fort Snowhawk and Fort Snowhawk Prison.\r\nThis imposing keep serves as a point of contention between the Stormcloaks and the Imperial Legion during the civil war. Until then, it’s populated by a band of necromancers. You can tackle this eroding stronghold in a number of ways—storm the front gate, slip in through the hole in the southeast wall, or leap over any of the crumbling battlements.",
