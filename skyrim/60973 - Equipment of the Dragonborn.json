  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6]READ THE DESCRIPTION\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The whole idea behind this mod is to create a stealthy ranger-esque looking character that can be considered a bit intimidating, but not TOO intimidating.  This is also going for a realistic play through, as evidenced by the inclusion of the mod Frostfall in  the required list.  It is a bit game breaking, but this is more for if you have played Skyrim several times, and just want a playthrough where you can just do whatever you want.   I have included a few pieces of armor from some mods, which are listed below.  I take [url=#]no credit[img]http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png[/img][/url] for any of these mods or what they contain.   I only put this thing together.   I own NONE of it.\r<br />\r<br />Please let me know if any of the items don&#39;t work or the [url=#]optional[img]http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png[/img][/url] files with the enchantable items have items that won&#39;t enchant.   I will either remove them, or try to get them to work properly.  Thanks&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This is a equipment file that will set you up like how my character is (before enchantments and re-enforcing their armor/weapons)\r<br />Note:   This batch-file requires the following mods/DLC:\r<br />Skyrim (Obviously)\r<br />Dawnguard\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19733/?http://]Immersive Armors[/url] \r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27644/?]Immersive Weapons[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33391/?]Face Masks of Skyrim[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16438/?]Bandoliers - Bags and Pouches[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/21720/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D21720&pUp=1]Left Hand Rings[/url] \r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50528/?]Scoped Bows[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14152/?]Leveler&#39;s Tower[/url] \r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11163/?]Frostfall - Hypothermia Camping Survival[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />PERMISSIONS:\r<br />\r<br />THIS IS THE ORIGINAL POST.   IF you see this mod anywhere else, that is a copy.  This is the current one (although what I would update about this is BEYOND me)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS\r<br />The creators of all of the aforementioned mods\r<br />Nexus for this site\r<br />Bethesda for Skyrim\r<br />My Dad for the PC\r<br />Dell for making the PC\r<br />Fanfiction ......
