  "descriptionHtml": "~ DESCRIPTION ~\r\nRemoved the humans only requirement from the spell \\\"Dead Thrall\\\", so you\\'ll now be able to reincarnate permanent units other than humans, such as animals and mythical creatures. (I kept the regular necromancy limits though).\r\n\r\n~ INSTALL ~\r\nPut the \\\"DeadThrall.esp\\\" file in your data folder and make sure you have it checked in the \\\"DATA FILES\\\" sectionwhen you launch the game.\r\n\r\n~ UNINSTALLING ~\r\nUninstalling is easy, you simply remove the \\\"DeadThrall.esp\\\" file. The already animated mobs will most likely stay alive until they die, but you won\\'t be able to re-animate them once the .esp file is gone.\r\n\r\n~ COMPATIBILITY ~\r\nThis modification should not interfere with any other mods, it only touches the effect of the spell \\\"Dead Thrall\\\"",
