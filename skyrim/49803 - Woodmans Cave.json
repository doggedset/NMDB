  "summary": "A small playerhome, Woodman&#39;s Cave is literally a small cave with some specific luxuries in it. Located near Falkreath.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Woodman&#39;s Cave is a little hideout, located just north of Falkreath. A map marker is in place to show it&#39;s entrance, a barred-up well.\r<br />\r<br />Inside, you will find a cave with a wooden floor and two rooms. The first is made quite bare on purpose, as it houses tools for smithing purposes and a small sitting space. The inner room houses a bed, storage chest, alchemy lab, enchanting lab, a mannequin for your gear and a display case for your weapon. \r<br />\r<br />Doesnt require Dawnguard or Hearthfire. \r<br />\r<br />Any and all feedback is appreciated, as this is the first mod I&#39;ve made thus far, apart from the tutorial ones.",
