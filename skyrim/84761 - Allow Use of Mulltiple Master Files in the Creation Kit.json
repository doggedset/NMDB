  "modName": "Allow Use of Mulltiple Master Files in the Creation Kit",
  "summary": "",
  "descriptionHtml": "Why I created this mod:\r<br />Finding true information in this &#39;filter bubble&#39;, many false facts filled internet is difficult nowadays.\r<br />\r<br />The creation kit wouldn&#39;t allow me to open multiple master files. Most of the information on the internet on how to fix this didn&#39;t provide me with the correct information on how to do it. I discovered that most people only talked about putting\r<br />\r<br />bAllowMultipleMasterFiles=1\r<br />bAllowMultipleMasterLoads=1\r<br />\r<br />into the general section of SkyrimEditor.ini.\r<br />\r<br />This isn&#39;t enough to make the creation Kit work properly. There is more to add in the archive section of this ini file. So, after hours and hours of researching I finally found the answer on how to do it. I created this mod in hopes that my findings will help others be able to open multiple master files in the creation kit.\r<br />\r<br />Installation Instructions:\r<br />Insert my ini file into the Skyrim Folder\r<br />\r<br />OR\r<br />\r<br />Insert in SkyrimEditor.ini what&#39;s mentioned in the txt file in my mod.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />You need all of the DLCs to replace your SkyrimEditor.ini with mine. If you don&#39;t have all the DLCS, then get rid of the words for the DLCS that you don&#39;t have in the archive section of my SkyrimEditor.ini.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />NOTE:\r<br />Do not download with NMM. This is my first mod so I&#39;m not good at making mods yet. For some reason the check box to not let people download my mod with NMM was greyed out. So, I couldn&#39;t check it.",
