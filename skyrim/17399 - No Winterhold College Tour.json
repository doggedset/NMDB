  "descriptionHtml": "NO COLLEGE TOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nJust a very quick mod that allows you to tell Mirabelle that you don\\'t need a tour of the college, after all once you\\'ve played through once or twice you don\\'t really need it and following NPC\\'s around seems to take forever. \r\n\r\nThis mod adds a dialogue option where you tell Mirabelle you don\\'t need a tour and the game will move you on a stage bypassing stage 40 (the tour) and carries on \\\"First Lessons\\\"\r\n\r\nVersion 2.0\r\n\r\nFixed a bug that had crept in where sometimes the quest wouldn\\'t move on after speaking to Mirabelle. Also made her dialogue stay onscreen",
