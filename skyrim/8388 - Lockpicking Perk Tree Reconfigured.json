  "modName": "Lockpicking Perk Tree Reconfigured",
  "summary": "This mod changes the structure of the Lockpicking Perk Tree to split the \\'core\\' perks into their own path and make the other perks more accessible for people who have a natural affinity for lockpicking.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Lockpicking perk tree is now split into two paths.  Novice up through Master are on a stand-alone path and I have created a new path using Quick Hands, Golden Touch, and Locksmith.\r\n\r\nWax Key, Treasure Hunter, and Unbreakable are still linked to their normal parent perks.\r\n\r\nThis mod will conflict with any other mod that changes the Lockpicking perks or tree.",
