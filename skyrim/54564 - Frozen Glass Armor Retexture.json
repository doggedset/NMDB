  "descriptionHtml": "-- CHANGELOG --\r<br />\r<br />v1.1: Okay, so I figured out why the golden hues were appearing on the male cuirass and the helmets. It turns out the meshes themselves have certain &#34;cubemaps&#34; that decide how they will shine. I fixed them to make them also shine like glass. However, as a few of you specifically told me you like the gold hues, I made a version for you as well.\r<br />\r<br />I will probably begin work on frozen glass weapons for those of you that are interested soon. I am still new to this stuff, so a standalone may not happen for a while, or never.\r<br />\r<br />-- DESCRIPTION --\r<br />\r<br />Disclaimer: This is my first foray into re-texturing, so I apologize for any mistakes. These replacer textures are basically recolors of the vanilla glass armor that make it appear a bit frozen. I made this for fun, and figured I would share for anyone that may enjoy them.\r<br />\r<br />I was going for an icy kind of feel, with even the non-glass parts having hints of light blue on them. As these are just textures, they will work with any glass armor mod that changes the mesh. For reasons beyond my knowledge, the male cuirass and the helmet have a goldish color to them even though I made everything steel-like in the texture. It actually looks kind of nice, though.\r<br />\r<br />Check out the pictures to see if this is something you would like. Gruntlock also made a nice video showing the armor in the videos tab.\r<br />\r<br />-- INSTALLATION --\r<br />Pick one of the main files, either Steel or Gold. Both of them are the same texture, but shine differently, based on your preference. Personally, I prefer and intended for the Steel color option. However, you can use either.\r<br />\r<br />If you find that the gauntlets, boots, or any particular armor part look strange in the Gold option, you can go into this mod&#39;s files and delete the corresponding .nif file. For example, if you don&#39;t like the gauntlets having the golden glow, go to this mod archive, then meshes, armor, glass, and then delete the boots files in both m and f.",
