  "descriptionHtml": "[b]NOTE: This mod is no longer being maintained, as I don\\'t have the time.  Anyone is free to pick it up.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b][size=8][color=green]Quieter World[/color][/size][/b]\r\n\r\nThese mods reduce the amount of loud, overplayed ambiance noise constantly found in dungeons, forts, and caves, and in the outside world.  This noise drowns out other immersive sounds that would otherwise make for a enjoyable romp through the slaughter of your enemies, particularly for sneaky players.  Players that use quality speakers and headphones will most enjoy this mod.\r\n\r\nRemember the cave in the tutorial where you have to sneak past the bear?   It\\'s a gorramn wind tunnel.   Are there tornadoes outside pushing air down into the cave?  NO.  How is that bear supposed to hear you over all that noise?   How about all the fort creaking and constnat cave rumbling that comes from nowhere?  Skyrim does not have that much tectonic activity to warrant that much noise.  The last time I went in a cave in the Real World(tm), it was not constantly rumbling and every room wasn\\'t a wind tunnel.  Neither should Skyrim.\r\n\r\n(Sorry, bit of a rant, its something that\\'s always bugged me about Bethesda games.)\r\n\r\n[size=4][b][color=green]What this mod does:[/color][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nWhat these mods actually do is, rather than completely remove the sound loops, this mod reduces the volume of it down to a faint whisper.  You will still hear rumbling, but it should be very faint.\r\n\r\n[size=4][b][color=green]What this mod does not:[/color][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nShort sounds (small cave rumbles, wind gusts, dirt falling) and sourced sounds (running water producing a running water sound) are not affected.  Dwemer dungeons are still noisy (as it should be) and mostly untouched.  There will still be noises, but it shouldn\\'t be too overplayed and constantly in your ear like its right next to you.\r\n\r\n[size=4][b][color=green]About the current version:[/color][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nDungeons (1.0.0): Normalized sounds for consistency.  Raised fort creaking noises slightly to be heard more, but still a whisper.\r\n\r\nWinds (1.0.0):  Created this mod per a request.  Lowered the constant outside wind noise way down, but enough to where it still feels right and calmer.  I kept it as a separate mod in case one doesn\\'t want both.  Wind gusts are not modified, as they should be in-your-face.\r\n\r\n",
