  "descriptionHtml": "This is not integrated with Skyrim directly. You can input the ingredients which you have in your inventory manually to this tool (or you can tell it to assume you have all ingredients with you).\r<br />You can analyze ingredients in your inventory with this tool in-order to identify different kinds of potions which you could create with the current inventory.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Item count is not used currently by the software. With those item count values I hope to implement an AI system to suggest ingredients to user.\r<br />\r<br />[/b]Database file is MSAccess. Anyone can add new ingredients they have in their game. Especially the ingredients added by mods are not included in the database file.\r<br />\r<br />I will soon add a better description to this. This is my first upload to a mod community.
