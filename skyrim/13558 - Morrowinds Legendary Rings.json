The 3 Spells will only be added to your spellbook when you wear the ring. Those spells cost you magicka, but therefore can be used without restrictions.\r\n\r\nAdditional Artifacts:\r\n\r\nRobe of the Drake\\'s Pride\r\nIncrease Magicka by 50, gives 25% Fire Resistances and reflects 25% Damage.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation of the Rings:\r\nAll enemies are non leveled and you should have atleast Level 25, better between 30 and 40.(Depending on your difficult setting)\r\n\r\nAncient Sealing Altar:\r\nBetween Windhelm and Whiterun on the top of a snowy mountain lies an ancient altar. There waits a terrible danger for every strong hero. Can you best this being and get its famous treasure?\r\n\r\nSecret Thalmor Lookout:\r\nEast/Southeast of Windhelm on one of the moutain sides is a small,hidden encampment of the Thalmor. There the \\\"evil\\\" Altmer spy on the brave people of Skyrim. Will you stop them?\r\n\r\nMorthal:\r\nThe traveling merchant Caius Varro has set up his tents in Morthal, further also the Gentleman\\'s Corner had started business. Those two are connected through fate, will you be the guide?\r\n\r\nImperial Ghost Ship:\r\nOn a shore, northwest of Solitude, a ship clouded in thick fog can be found. What poor souls are bound there?\r\n(No MapMarker till you board this ship!)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhiterun:\r\n\r\nCurrently, the five(those that have no location till now) rings can be found outside of Dragonsreach(near the letter E from dragonsreach on the local map), on the right side in a chest (I have added a picture which shows the location). Only available there till all five other quests/locations are implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks, Updates and other usefull Informations:\r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating the Basic Mesh and Texture for the Ring of Khajiit (unused in Skyrim). I modified the texture and gave the rings the colors they had in Morrowind.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlans for next Update:\r\nThe next time will most probably feature a big nordic dungeon with a story involving the companions.\r\n\r\nLast Update:\r\nAdded the Imperial Ghost Ship.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you find any bugs or have suggestion for improvements I would like to read/hear your opinion.\r\nIf you liked this mod please endorse it.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nCopy both Files into your Skyrim/Data.\r\n\r\nDeinstallation:\r\n\r\nBefore you delete the two files, please unequip all rings and let wear off all effects from the rings!\r\n\r\nCan also be found here:\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=16030",
