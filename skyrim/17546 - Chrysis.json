A secret that many do not know... It is said that he was the son of a snow elf and a nordic woman. It is said that he was presented, by Tiber Septim, a blade that was once gifted to a mortal by Jyggalag. It is said that the blade, enchanted with frost and named Chrysis was taken back the daedric prince when Jokren died. It is said that Jyggalag promised never to bring the sword back to mundus till a hero worthy of it is born again. Are you the hero?\\\"[/b]\r\n\r\nChrysis, the Blue Sword is a glass sword-like sword that is enchanted with frost damage to health and stamina. The blade can be found in a newly added small dungeon in the wilderness. No clues as to where the dungeon is, but I assure you, it is in an easy to find location. Once you get to the dungeon there are only a few draugr and spiders you have to go through before getting the sword. It might be a bit over-powered for some but that is only in the beginning levels. It\\'s quite fast, though not as fast as before, so that it can be more balance. Additional lore can be found in-game in a book named \\\"Chrysis, the Blue Sword\\\" by \\\"Hefelin Tham\\\", which can be found in Windhelm Stables, Whiterun Guard House or the dungeon that contains the sword. Future updates not guaranteed as I might start work with other mods.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/imageshare/images/3970478-1337943795.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Added a dungeon with enemies that houses the sword.\r\n[*]Added in-game lore, to provide \\\"fictional\\\" back story.\r\n[*]Changed the speed, made it less because it was too fast.\r\n[*]Textures also changed for a little bit more blue-er effect.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/imageshare/images/3970478-1337944313.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n[center][heading]Nothing that I know of, but if you find any, please report.[/heading][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/imageshare/images/3970478-1338021257.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Improve the dungeon a bit, maybe.\r\n[*]Custom meshes, thanks to Saiodin.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/imageshare/images/3970478-1338021436.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Best In Slot for the extremely helpful tutorials.\r\n[*]Bethesda Softworks for the game so good.\r\n[*]ThirteenOranges for help with the map marker.\r\n[*]Saiodin for pointing out LeckerHamster\\'s tutorial.\r\n[*]Ragnar the Blue for giving hints on improvement.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[/center]\r\n[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17546][img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/imageshare/images/4637400-1338121129.jpg[/img][/url]   [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17795][img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/imageshare/images/4637400-1338213473.jpg[/img][/url][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/imageshare/images/3970478-1338046118.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n[center][youtube]OmfP_2Rc-q8[/youtube]               [youtube]cC0pVVBk2v8[/youtube][/center]",
