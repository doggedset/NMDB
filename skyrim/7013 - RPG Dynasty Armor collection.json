  "descriptionHtml": "First things first. This Collection woulld not exist if it wasnt for the works of Ken1945, Codecrackerx9, and Dalmatan. Thank you for what you did and letting me share my versions. also Thank you Drakishar! for the help with the mesh fixes for Ver 1.2!\r\n\r\nThis Collection is of various retextures and alterations to the Dynasty armor mod. armors will be available in diferent main colors as well as with various trims.  As i make more versions i\\'ll add them in so you should have several to choose from. \r\n\r\n**********************************Details************************************\r\nThis mod is Female style only At this time, sorry guys if you wear it youll be getting some serious alterations to your figure from the neck down \r\n\r\nmods work independant of origonal so you can have multiple in game at same time\r\n\r\nAll armors are currently Dragonplate heavy armor with apropriate stats - may alter some as i get better with editing\r\n\r\nCrafting for each version varies slightly to match the armors coloring i.e steel dynasty requires Steel ingots , Saphire will need saphires etc\r\n\r\nCuirass\\'s come in 3 varients for all armors regardless of trim/colors  Full chainmail/ No chainmail like the origonal mod but also with option 3 comes my own attempt at a low cut top to the chainmail.  ( ill be reworking this as time goes on and may make alternate ones of it too )\r\n\r\nArmors are Craftable, Refineable, and Enchantable..they are not Edible..unless your a Dragon..\r\n\r\n******************************UPDATE*************************************\r\nV1.2 - fixed most of the mesh issues ( Thank you Drakishar! ) now armor should not be see thru if looked at from odd angles. the vanishing leggs issue i havent found a fix for totally but replaced the Non-chaimails mesh with Drakishars CBBE compatible mesh that dosent have that issue, still looking for way to fix for the chainmail and lowcut ( especially if lowcut could show true skin color)\r\n\r\n1/29/12 Uploaded the sapphire collection as sol and also as part of the rpg full collection includes steel in it-(RPG added to help avoid confusion with other collections)\r\n\r\nAdded image of 2 glove styles im considering Leather ( preview of what im making for light armor version) and a chainmail glove that resulted from the tweeks ive done.  feel free to give me your opinions on which you would prefer as the default glove type. or would you like both as a gloves option based on armor type alone? \r\n\r\n1.1\r\nFixed steel Dynasty upgrade option - should be fully upgradeable and enchantable now \r\nalso put textures and meshes into subfolders so they should install into correct paths better\r\n( sorry bout that, consider steel my trial and error for uploading a mod )\r\n\r\n***********************IN THE WORKS***********************************\r\n\r\nIve goten a nice leather material started to use for a light armor varient, need to find the seems on the textures ( hard without the mesh unwrap the origonal textures were laid out onto so its a lota guess work ) \r\n\r\n*******************************INSTALL/UnINSTALL**********************\r\n\r\nIm going to highly recomend using the mod manager for that, seriously it knows what its doing\r\n\r\nIf you need help PM me ill see what i can do.\r\n\r\n****************Credit*********************\r\n\r\nCodecrackerx9 and Ken1945 for the origonal mod and its import from oblivion\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5733\r\n\r\nDalmatan for his retextures, they provide the base for most of mine http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6308\r\n\r\nDrakishar for his CBBE compatible mesh that replaces the Non-chainmail versions in the collection. \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6166",
