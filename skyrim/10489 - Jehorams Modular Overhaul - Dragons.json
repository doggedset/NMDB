Most of these mods are highly personalized and loaded into a GameplayTweaks.ESM so I\\'m going to be basically recreating them all from scratch. Eventually I\\'ll have a single comprehensive list for the whole projects but I\\'m going to start out small here with a thread designated for only the Dragon Module. This mod will focus on \\\"realism\\\" and being as lore-friendly as possible, although I may include an optional .ESP with dragon hatchlings. Now for the Features...\r\n\r\n[color=#a52a2a][b][size=5]Changelog[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[b]Version .1b[/b]\r\n\r\n- Dragons soak up much more damage (see readme for specific data)\r\n- Fear Effect on most NPC\\'s (excludes guards)\r\n- Unique Dragon stats for Alduin, Paarthurnax, Odaahviing and the Blackreach Dragon\r\n\r\n[color=#a52a2a][b][size=5]Suggestions & Questions[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\nPost them here in the thread and I\\'ll do my best to respond in a timely manner. If there\\'s something that needs to be asked over PM then I\\'m open to it, but try to keep it in the thread if possible.\r\n\r\n[size=5][b][color=#a52a2a]Compatibility[/color][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nThis mod will [b]NOT[/b] be compatible with Deadly Dragons or any other mod that does similar things to Dragons or their spawns.\r\nThis mod [b]WILL[/b] be compatible with any and all retextures and remeshes (if their are any) as it doesn\\'t affect either of these.",
