  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][color=#00ff00]For all 3D models and textures from Tenchu 3 and Shinobido characters look at the video below &#33; I&#39;m looking for modders who want to make ninjas alive in Skyrim &#33; My Creation Kit never worked even once after weeks of trying so I&#39;m unable to make 100% perfect characters because my armatures are always broken. Feel free to use it &#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Hello Tenchu fans &#33;\r<br />This mod was based on &#34;The Ninja Project&#34; by Infernozard7 on Nexus Skyrim. I remodeled, retextured everything and added few items.[/size]\r<br />[color=#ffff00]\r<br />[size=4]INSTALL RIKIMARU: [/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />1. Put &#34;Meshes&#34;, &#34;Textures&#34; and &#34;esp.&#34; in the /Data folder inside Skyrim directory. \r<br />2. Enable mod in the &#34;Data files&#34; after executing &#34;SkyrimLauncher.exe&#34; \r<br />3. Load your saved game \r<br />4. Open console command by pressing &#34;~&#34; \r<br />5. In the console command type: &#34;help Rikimaru 0&#34;. Now you can see the list of all the items the mod uses with it&#39;s ID. \r<br />6. Type: &#34;player.additem &lt;ID of item here 1&gt; (example: player.additem 03000BD6 1) 9. Close console &#34;~&#34;. Open the inventory and put on the items. (I&#39;m preety sure that head doesn&#39;t work for Khajit)\r<br />7. Download and Install &#34;KS Hairdos - Renewal by Kalilies and Stealthic&#34; on Nexus Skyrim. \r<br />8. Type: &#34;showracemenu&#34; - it should turn on character creation. Adjust weight, mouth, nose and chin parameters to minimal if the face is glitching with the &#34;Rikimaru&#39;s Head&#34;. \r<br />It was important to do it like this because of dissapearing hair,ears etc. Just try to make it similar to presented pictures.\r<br />Now go to hair section in the race menu and search for the one in the pictures. Best hair for Rikimaru is called &#34;blue.nif&#34; in the &#34;meshes&#34; folder.\r<br />If your Skyrim is overloaded and crashing because of 1000+ hair models just delete every nif. file except &#34;blue.nif&#34; and other ones you like. You can preview nif. files using NifScope.\r<br />9. Play\r<br />\r<br />I used Imperial Male for showcasing this mod but it should work for Nords, Bretons and Redguards too. \r<br />I&#39;m using &#34;Weapons Of The Shogunate 1_06&#34; by &#34;Moraelin&#34; for various types of japanese weapons.\r<br />For grapling hook install &#34;Pull Mastery Hookshot or Grappling hook&#34; by [b]&#34;Xzax&#34; on Skyrim Nexus.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4]\r<br />INSTALL AYAME:[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m not the author of Ayame Mod. If you read this it means I&#39;m still pending for permission. The author is called &#34;Unrealrogue&#34; on Nexus Skyrim and he also made this mod for Oblivion.\r<br />The permission for sharing files has &#34;Nie&#34; on &#34;killingdool.com&#34;. This mod has a glitch with the chest area when you do any movement. It&#39;s still playable and not really disturbing.\r<br />\r<br />Download link - http://killingdoll.com/?p=12917\r<br />\r<br />I highly reccomend to download &#34;Ponytail Hairstyles v3_0&#34; by &#34;Azar&#34; on Nexus Skyrim. Hair in this pack are the ones shown in the pictures.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]EdlBzPDJauY[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]Nqth4o2yRuA[/youtube]\r<br />If someone wants to make Tenchu and Shinobido related mods you can use 3d models here. Took me over 45 hours to make...\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]I-6Sv33TQLs[/youtube]",
