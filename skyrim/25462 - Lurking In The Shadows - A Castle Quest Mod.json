It is for characters 35-81lvl. Play at Master only if you are level 60 and above. I played the mod with an 81lvl Warrior at new Legendary difficulty, \r<br />armed with a legendary Deadric warhammer(damage 500+) and the mod was still quite challenging.\r<br />**********************************************************************************************************************************[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=+1]\r<br />[color=green]THREE VERSIONS TO CHOOSE FROM...[/color]\r<br />[color=orange]CHOOSE THE APPROPRIATE CASTLE VERSION FOR YOUR CHARACTER.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=purple]Vampire Version:[/color] \r<br />In the Vampire version you get the same old \r<br />atmospheric Castle.\r<br />\r<br />[color=cyan]Mortal Version:[/color]\r<br />In the mortal version after finishing the quest the curse \r<br />is lifted and the castle becomes a hospitable place again. \r<br />That means the darkness is reduced, the Cobwebs and rubbles are \r<br />removed. The Castle gets extra decoration and \r<br />generally it is brought back to it&#39;s former glory.   \r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Werewolf Version:[/color]\r<br />In the werewolf version after finishing the quest the curse\r<br />turns the castle to a werewolf lair, your own werewolf lair.\r<br />All castle rooms and corridors gain a mysterious reddish aura and\r<br />some castle rooms change in order to fit in the werewolf character.\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange]IMPORTANT:You cannot use two or all three versions at the same time&#33; Read installation instructions.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]AFTER FINISHING THE QUEST:[/color]\r<br />YOU CAN BECOME THE LORD OF CASTLE RAVENBURG\r<br />by talking to the Castle&#39;s Caretaker Clove. \r<br />He will be waiting for you at Castle&#39;s Court, \r<br />if he is not there just pull the chain\r<br />next to the throne to call him there. \r<br />Clove will give you the options to:\r<br />-Hire Castle Guards\r<br />-Hire a Blacksmith-Merchant(at Castle Laboratory)\r<br />-Hire a Court Alchemist-Merchant\r<br />-Hire a Court Wizard-Merchant\r<br />-Hire a Court General Merchant\r<br />-Hire a Court Bard(Mortal Version) or Jester(Vampire Version) or wolf pets(Werewolf Version) \r<br />-He will also give you a Teleportation Tome\r<br />This book will teleport you instantly to important Castle Rooms\r<br />and Skyrim cities(Vampire Version).\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][size=+1]THE CASTLE HAS THE FOLLOWING AREAS:[/size][/color]\r<br />[size=+1]\r<br />-A fully functional Drawbridge\r<br />-Portcullis\r<br />-Entry Hall\r<br />-Corridors of despair\r<br />-Great Hall\r<br />-Hall of Faith\r<br />-Old Chapel\r<br />-Condemned Tower\r<br />-Tower Room\r<br />-Barracks Tower & Armory\r<br />-Clock Tower\r<br />-Court\r<br />-Throne Room\r<br />-Library\r<br />-Rooms Of Weeping\r<br />-Laboratory\r<br />-Main Tower\r<br />-Prison Tower\r<br />-Larders of ill omen\r<br />-Dungeon\r<br />-Crypts of eternity\r<br />-Caverns\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow][size=+1]THE CASTLE PROVIDES:[/size][/color]\r<br />[size=+1]\r<br />-Sleepable Coffins\r<br />-Vampire Cattle\r<br />-Alchemy Lab\r<br />-Arcane Enchanter\r<br />-Smelter\r<br />-Tanning Rack\r<br />-Grindstone\r<br />-Workbench\r<br />-Cooking Pot\r<br />-43 Mannequins (In case you miss them, 40 of the mannequins are located in the basement of the barracks tower. The entrance to the barracks tower is located opposite of the castle&#39;s main building entrance in the courtyard. Three more mannequins are located in rooms of weeping on the second floor.)\r<br />-Lots of display cases\r<br />-Lots of Weapon Racks\r<br />-Weapon Plaques\r<br />-Easter Eggs\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=green]\r<br />** The Castle is fully navmeshed and tested. **\r<br />\r<br />** It has no LOD but you will not have\r<br />   problems with flying windows and walls. **\r<br />\r<br />*****************************************************************************[/color]\r<br />[color=orange]WARNING:\r<br />-If you use this castle as your home, remove any items that \r<br /> you have placed inside, before  updating. I am not responsible \r<br /> for lost items after updates. \r<br />-If you play the Mortal or Werewolf version do not place \r<br /> inside the Castle any valuables until you finish the quest.\r<br />- There are a lot of secret passages, take your time \r<br />  to search the Castle carefully for levers torches,\r<br />  buttons etc, you will not regret it&#33;\r<br />  A small TIP: When you find a secret door behind a \r<br />  wardrobe, search the enviroment around it, there are \r<br />  switches(custom hotspots, like torches attached to \r<br />  wall, statues etc) that will reveal those secret passages.\r<br />I HAVE ALSO UPLOADED A SCREENSHOT GUIDE TO HELP YOU. \r<br />- It is very dark inside the Castle. If you\r<br />  don&#39;t have spells that illuminate your path, \r<br />  you can use the castle&#39;s torches, there are plenty.  \r<br />-If you later use this as a player home, put your\r<br /> items in empty chests located in front of beds,\r<br /> I am not responsible for lost items after updates.  \r<br />*****************************************************************************[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]To complete the quest from Console:[/color]\r<br />If you are the kind of person that you are too lazy to play the quest, something I totally discourage and you want to make the castle yours right away you have to use the console in order to finish the quest. Remember this will work only for the Mortal and the Werewolf version of the mod. For the vampire version you still have to clear it from monsters. Stand outside the castle open the console with ~ then type:\r<br />SetStage TescosLurkingInTheShadowsQuest 50\r<br />type ~ to close the console. Hit ok on the quest&#39;s textbox that will show up. Enter the castle from any exterior gate. The Castle is now yours&#33;\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][font=Times New Roman][color=#f4f4f4][size=+3]THE CHARACTERS[/size][/color][/font][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=+1][color=yellow]Two new followers:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />-Nikolai Van Helsing: a mage specialized to destroy undead.\r<br />\r<br />-Tormented soul: A headless ghost warrior(just like the headless horseman).\r<br />\r<br />*Since there are two unique followers I suggest you to play this mod with UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul mod installed. You can find it here: \r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037]UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]Several other characters:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />-Count Bran Von Lurk: The villain\r<br />-Clove: The caretaker of the castle\r<br />-Lestat: Count&#39;s bodyguard\r<br />\r<br />***All characters have speech and lip sync***\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]Just a Suggestion:[/color]\r<br />if you are married and use this castle as your home,\r<br />you can use the &#34;Spouses Can Live Everywhere&#34; mod \r<br />to make your spouse go there.\r<br />you can find it here: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11370]\r<br />Spouses Can Live Everywhere[/url]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][font=Times New Roman][color=#f4f4f4][size=+3]INSTALLATION[/size][/color][/font][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=+1][color=green]************************************************************************************\r<br />IMPORTANT: SKYRIM MUST BE UPDATED BEFORE INSTALLING\r<br />************************************************************************************[/color]\r<br />- My suggestion is to try to install the mod manually and not use automatic installation that NMM provides because, some times I&#39;ve noticed that you end up with the mod installed, but with missing files(textures, scripts etc). Download the Mod manually. When finished downloading open NMM go to mods tab, click on the first button on the left (puzzle piece with a plus) a file browser will open, in there select the mod file and click the button open. Then go to the mod tree category &#34;Quests and adventures&#34; find and select my mod and click the second button from the left (puzzle piece with a green arrow facing right). A progress bar will appear and if everything goes well, a message will appear that the mod was successfully activated.\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]IMPORTANT:\r<br />When first time in-game(with the mod active) \r<br /> 1)Make a new save, 2)exit game, 3)run game, 4)load  previous savegame\r<br />[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange]\r<br />*****************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />IMPORTANT ABOUT HAVING ALLREADY A VERSION AND INSTALLING ANOTHER VERSION: \r<br />\r<br />-First of all before installing another version REMOVE ALL YOUR VALUABLE ITEMS FROM \r<br /> THE CASTLE. You will not have access to the same cells after update, and you may lose\r<br /> all your items inside the previous version.\r<br />\r<br />-IF YOU HAVE ALLREADY INSTALLED ANOTHER VERSION, UNINSTALL IT BEFORE \r<br /> INSTALLING ANOTHER ONE.\r<br />\r<br />-You cannot use all versions at the same time. That&#39;s impossible.\r<br />\r<br />-If you have already summoned the undead guards of the Vampire Version, don&#39;t worry    \r<br /> they won&#39;t bother you. The newest mortal guards that you hired will replace them.\r<br />\r<br />-You must replace the teleportation book that you already own with another one because  \r<br /> the old teleportation volume won&#39;t work at all with the new version. To do this just    \r<br /> ask Clove about what happened to the Count again, continue the dialogue until he gives  \r<br /> you the book again. If Clove doesn&#39;t have the above dialogue option quit and re-run the game.\r<br />\r<br />-If in your latest save game you are inside the castle, exit the Castle and re-enter it from \r<br /> any outside gate.\r<br />*****************************************************************************************************************************[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]TROUBLESHOOT[/color]\r<br />-Usually a crash at start up is a load order issue. Try to change the load order, place the mod last   in the list. If you don&#39;t know how to do this take a look here:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/news/295//?]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/news/295//?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />-if the courier doesn&#39;t come to give you the letter\r<br /> or If the quest doesn&#39;t start type ~ to open\r<br /> console and then type:\r<br /> setstage TescosLurkingInTheShadowsQuest  20\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]KNOWN ISSUES[/color]\r<br />-While playing the quest don&#39;t use Autorun. You may miss some \r<br />quest scenes that explain the plot, if you keep using it all the time.\r<br />-Summoned guards tend to be hostile when you get close to them or \r<br />not attacking player&#39;s enemies at all.\r<br /> \r<br />[color=yellow]INCOMPATIBILITIES[/color]\r<br />This mod may be incompatible with other mods that use the courier quest system.\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]VERSION LOG:[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=cyan]VERSION 2.0.Final CHANGES [/color]\r<br />-Removed navmesh deletions.\r<br />I am so excited for this new update. Finally, the mod reached version 2.0. This final update has some very important changes made by the Nexus community member Ablaze666.
