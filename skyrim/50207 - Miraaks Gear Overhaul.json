  "descriptionHtml": "                                              [size=20][i][center]Miraak&#39;s Gear Overhaul[/center][/i][/size]\r<br />                                          \r<br />[center][IMG]http://static1.nexusmods.com/15/images/110/5805078-1390373994.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r<br />   \r<br />This provides everything you could want with Miraak&#39;s equipment, including very unique enchantments, equipping bonuses, and tons of customization.  Now you can conquer your enemies while they show you the fear and respect you deserve as Dragonborn&#33;\r<br />\t\r<br />Having finally decided to complete the Dragonborn questline, I was underwhelmed with the prize loot.  I had some cool enchantment ideas already, and decided to apply them to Miraak&#39;s equipment. I also made the enchantments have bonus effects for wearing multiple pieces of Miraak&#39;s gear. \r<br />\r<br />[b][i]Changelog[/i][/b]\r<br />See the Readme for details in the recent patch\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />                                                    [center][color=yellow][b]Miraak&#39;s Gloves[/b][/color][/center]\r<br />[list]  \r<br />[*][color=orange]Corruption Aura[/color] -When wielding Miraak&#39;s sword, a foul aura decreases nearby enemies resistances to poisons and magic\r<br />[*]Absorbs 5% of Magicka from dragon breath and spells *Unlike the vanilla version, works as it&#39;s own enchantment, not dependent on the robes*\r<br />[/list]\r<br />                                                   [center][color=yellow][b]Miraak&#39;s Sword[/b][/color][/center]  \r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][color=orange]Spawn Poisonous Tentacles[/color] -Chance to attack enemies with tentacles on hit, dealing extra poison damage  \r<br />[*]Stamina Drain- 25 points for 2 seconds\r<br />[*]Soul Trap- 4 seconds\r<br />[/list]\r<br />                                                  [center][color=yellow][b]Miraak&#39;s Robes[/b][/color][/center] \r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][color=orange]Thu&#39;um Mastery[/color] -Reduces shout cooldown by 5% for each piece of Miraak&#39;s equipment worn (Robes, Gloves, Boots, Mask)   \r<br />[*]Absorb&#39; 20% of the Magicka from dragon breath and spells, and chance to spawn tentacle attack when being hit\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />                                                 [center][color=yellow][b]Miraak (Mask)[/b][/color][/center]  \r<br />[list]   \r<br />[*][color=orange]Terrifying Presence[/color] -Wearing it terrifies nearby enemies, which decreases their movement speed by 33%\r<br />[*][color=orange]Shout Potency[/color] -Increases shout damage by 25% (*note* for the enchantment to take effect, you will have to have crafted and read the book &#34;Miraak&#39;s Knowledge&#34; which can be found in the Daedric Smithing section)\r<br />[*]Increases Magicka by 25\r<br />[/list]\r<br />                                                  [center][color=yellow][b]Miraak&#39;s Boots[/b][/color][/center] \r<br />[list]    \r<br />[*][color=orange]Sure Footed[/color] -Creates a barrier that adds 250 armor, but only when you are at full health\r<br />[*]Absorbs 5% of the Magicka from dragon breath and spells, *same as gloves*\r<br />[*]Increases Stamina by 25.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[i]Customization[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange]Light, Heavy, or Clothing Variations[/color]\r<br />Now in the spirit of customization, I also created multiple variations of the gear as Heavy Armor, Light Armor, and Clothing/\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange]Unenchanted Versions[/color]  \r<br />All gear comes with unenchanted versions as well.  Miraak&#39;s Sword also comes with a version that does not having the long tentacle-whip animation, as well as a completely unenchanted version.\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange]Craftable and Upgradable[/color]\r<br />All of these variants can be crafted under the Daedric Smithing section, and the armored versions can be tempered at the workbench. You do not have to have the Daedric Smithing perk, but you will have to have already defeated Miraak in Apocrypha.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[i]From the Author[/i]\r<br />\r<br />I initially was just making these changes for myself, but had a great time doing it that I wanted to share it with everyone.  I am open to suggestions from anyone for any ideas to add to this, so let me know and I&#39;ll see what I can do. This could very much be treated as a WIP as I plan to add more as I think of more ideas or i hear ideas from commenters.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility\r<br />You will need Dragonborn DLC, and this most likely will not be compatible with other mods that alter Miraak&#39;s gear\r<br />\r<br />[b]Downloading[/b]\r<br />NMM or manual into Data folder\r<br />",
