  "summary": "Very small mod that does one thing, make soul gems lighter.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Okay guys, this is my first released mod for Skyrim. It may not be that amazing, but that\\'s because this was initially just an ESP tweak that I used for myself. What this does is cut the weight of soul gems in half. I never could get used to seeing these black soul gems, that when dropped were only 2-4x the size of a diamond (weighing 0.1), so I started editing. This makes it easier to carry a few more gems while still maintianing the normal gameplay of skyrim (and you can carry twice as many soul gems now. Heh)\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nPlace in the Skyrim Data folder, launch skyrim, and activate the ESP\r\n\r\nUninstallation: \r\nDeactivate and Delete the ESP.\r\n\r\nLeave feedback, if this is plain s*** then let me know\r\n",
