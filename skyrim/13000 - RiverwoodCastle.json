  "descriptionHtml": "A new content area with a full main quest (WIP), and side quests to extend playtime for the Uber geared player.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s a work in progress, and all the quest lines have not been finished.  I just wanted to upload the new area.\r\n\r\nThere\\'s a castle town, a farm, a mining camp, and a khajiit village, and a new branch of the thief\\'s guild.  Vendors and trainers for pretty much everything, and two new followers, a khajiit mage named Heathcliff, and a Huntress named Jani who will marry you.  They\\'re a little over powered for the vanilla game, but just try out \\\"Megatron\\\" to see the kind of battles you\\'ll have in the end of the main quest when finished.\r\n\r\nAll of the voice-over work was done by me, and my mic sucks, so you can barely hear it.  This will be fixed in a later version.  The nav-mesh bug is in full effect, so don\\'t be surprised to see cows on rooftops, and guards standing in fountains.  :)",
