  "summary": "A tall and powerful companion, intended for low level characters.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod, so don&#39;t go expecting anything fancy.\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a Nord Warrior to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun who you can recruit as a follower, his name is Throgarn Strong-Arm. He will blindly accompany you for no reason upon asking him to, because again, this ain&#39;t anything fancy. If you are seeking a lore-friendly, capable and well equipped companion then look no further&#33; Throgarn comes equipped with a full set of steel armour, steel sword and steel shield. He is only level 15, so he is suited towards low level character and new play-throughs&#33; Also, he is pretty tall.\r<br />\r<br />Also, that quest I mentioned 2 years ago, yeah the one that I said would be coming &#34;soon&#34;. Yeah, I haven&#39;t gotten around to finishing that yet... sooo, expect it to be out sometime &#34;soon&#34;, again.  \r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />- To install this mod simply place the downloaded .esp file into your skyrim data folder, which will more than likely be this; \r<br />( C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;skyrim&#92;Data ).\r<br />\r<br /> - Once you have placed the file in your data folder, all you have to do is activate it with your preferred mod handling utility or the Skyrim Launcher.\r<br /> \r<br />Un-installation: \r<br />\r<br />simply deactivate the mod and remove it from your data folder.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy the mod&#33;",
