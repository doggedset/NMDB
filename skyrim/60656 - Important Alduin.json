  "descriptionHtml": "This removes Alduin from the beginning of the game at Helgen and places a normal dragon in his place. I thought plot-wise it wasn&#39;t great to reveal to main villain in the first five minutes of the game. \r<br />\r<br />Delphine talks about how she thinks the Thalmor summoned the dragons to attack Skyrim, but it obviously isn&#39;t true since Alduin is shown in the first five minutes of the game to be behind it all. This adds a little more mystery to the main villain and makes Alduin seem more of an adversary villain instead of a random angry monster villain.\r<br />\r<br />[b]This mod:\r<br />[/b]-Only removes Alduin from the Helgen scene and puts a normal dragon in his place\r<br />\r<br />[b]This mod does not:\r<br />[/b]-Remove Alduin from the game\r<br />-Replace Alduin&#39;s model\r<br />-Replace all the game&#39;s horses with weird My Little Pony models \r<br />\r<br />Load order goes ahead of any mods that affect Alduin, but this mod only affects the version of Alduin at the beginning of the game so it is compatible with stuff like World Eater Beater and other mods that affect Alduin.",
