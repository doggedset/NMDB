  "summary": "A set of boots that can be dis-enchanted for a waterwalking enchantment.",
  "descriptionHtml": "One of the most sought-after magical effects in TES III: Morrowind and TES IV: Oblivion was the ability of waterwalking. However, this ability was not included in the original version of TES V: Skyrim. But with the Dragonborn DLC, it has again made its appearance in Ahzidal&#39;s Boots of Waterwalking. But these boots - like a few other items in this DLC - cannot be dis-enchanted. This mod does not exactly allow the dis-enchanting of those boots, but rather, it adds a different pair of boots that can be dis-enchanted. Thus allowing this effect for the enchanting of other footwear.\r<br />\r<br />The boots, which I&#39;ve titled &#34;Boots of the Son&#34;, are hidden somewhere in Solstheim. I have provided a book titled &#34;Mythic Apparel&#34; in the Raven Rock temple, also. It&#39;s located on a shelf in the room to your left (West) as you go down the stairs from the entrance. Middle shelf, on the far right. The book gives some background lore on the boots and a riddle to solve in order to find them.\r<br />\r<br />I have also included an additional .rar, &#34;How-to-Find&#34;, that will give (hopefully) a good description of how to locate these boots. In case you&#39;re not feeling adventurous or are having troubles finding the boots.\r<br />\r<br />Note: This mod requires the Dragonborn DLC, as well as the update needed to play it. As obvious as this might seem, I felt it needed to be stated in the description.",
