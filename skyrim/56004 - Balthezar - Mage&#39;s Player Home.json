  "summary": "Adds a longhouse for mage players to Windhelm, visible from the bridge. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "This may affect anyone who plays as a companion&#33; With this installed you will not be able to join the companions, because I&#39;ve made changes to Dustman&#39;s Cairn -read the readme- it also has texture problems on the ice, and lighting problems on the interior of the longhouse, so far those are the only problems I&#39;ve found. You can immediatly fast travel too it, or if you want just fast travel to windhelm, jump off the bridge -XD- and land on the ice at the bottom. You&#39;ll have to cut your way threw a horde of Skeletons, Draugr&#39;s, 3 Draugr Scourge Lords, and a Dremora -if you fast travel a fight will break out instantly between you and the dremora, allowing you to skip past the army of undead-. \r<br />\r<br />--Only use if you just do side quests, and have completed the vanilla game & DLC&#39;s. See comments--\r<br />\r<br />--not responsible for any corrupted games or damages caused by the mod. I&#39;ve tested it on my own game only--",
