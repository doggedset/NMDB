  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Darker Dragonscale Armour[/b] (Version 1.0) by DragonReine\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nAs someone who was tired of the pale tan vanilla colouring of the dragonscale armour, but also not exactly keen on a matte black texture, I decided to retex the armour so that it suited my own tastes. \r\n\r\nThis retexture is:\r\n\r\n1) Darker, but not pure black: Mottled shades of dark red, purple, brown, dark green and gold have been used to give the armour a darker appearance without sacrificing colour variations that give the armour a more \\\"organic\\\" look.\r\n\r\n2) \\\"Grittier\\\": One rather minor gripe I had with the vanilla armour was that it looked too polished, which struck me as somewhat out of place. The retextured armour uses a slightly modified normal map with little nicks and pits that give the armour a weathered, battle-worn look.\r\n\r\n3) Higher resolution with sharper definition: All textures have their maps doubled in size, so more detail can be seen.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n[b][u]Version History[/u][/b]\r\n1.0 - Male armour, gauntlets, boots and helmet made available for download. Female armour release delayed due to lack of \\\"polish\\\". Uploaded 7th of January, 2012.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n[b][u]Installation[/u][/b]\r\n [b](RECOMMENDED METHOD)[/b] Use Nexus Mod Manager to automatically install.\r\n\r\n... or manually unzip 7zip file into the main Skyrim directory.\r\n\r\nDepending on your installation (physical disc, or digital Steam installation), the default directory would either be \r\n\r\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Bethesda\\\\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim \r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\r\n\r\nYou\\'ll know you\\'re in the right folder when you see the \\\"TESV.exe\\\" file and the \\\"Data\\\" folder.\r\n\r\nTo install, simply unzip the 7-Zip file straight into the main Skyrim folder, i.e. the \\\"The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim\\\" or \\\"skyrim\\\"\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n[b][u]Uninstallation[/u][/b]\r\nTo uninstall, disable/remove the mod (for Nexus Mod Manager installation) or simply delete the \\\"dragonscale\\\" folder from \\\"....Data\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\" (for manual installation)",
