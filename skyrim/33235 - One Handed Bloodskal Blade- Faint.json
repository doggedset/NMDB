  "modName": "One Handed Bloodskal Blade- Faint",
  "summary": "This mod adds a one handed version of the Bloodskal Blade.\r\nNOTE: The enchantment has been removed, but the blade can be enchanted.\r\nAlso, this is my first mod. So be gentle, and extra cautious!\r\nCalled Faint because I faint when I see Blood. *Ba dum Tissss*",
  "descriptionHtml": "NEW Cleaner version added. It\\'s standalone and has less bugs. It also leaves the original 2-hander alone. Can also craft it now.\r\n\r\nDragonborn required.\r\nInstallation: Add the mesh inside the meshes/weapons/dlc02/bloodsword folder\r\nInstall the esp inside the Data folder. Activate\r\nDone!\r\n\r\n-Craft it under the MISC Category. Must have Advanced Steel Smithing Perk.\r\n-Temper it with a Silver Ingot.\r\n-Can also add through console, type help Faint\r\n-Can enchant with any weapon enchantment\r\n\r\n\r\nI really liked the Bloodskal Blade for its Gothic appearance, but I felt it was very limited as a bulky two-hander. This mod adds a duplicate of the blade, with some slight modifications to the original Bloodskal Blade files (Nifskope and Creation Kit).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the enchantment had to be removed because it was a script, which was way outside my bounds. Hence, if anyone wants to re-make my mod, feel free to use my files.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, I suggest you use Imbued Weapons - Bloodskal Effect with any Melee Weapon by ChizFoShiz. Also, Bloodskal Gothic Retexture by Zazil works really well with this Blade, so use his mod too!\r\n\r\nDetailed list of changes:\r\nWeight changed to 15.\r\nReach/Stagger the same.\r\nValue changed to 666.\r\nDamage changed to 25.\r\nCritical is set to 10.\r\nAffects One-handed skill tree.\r\nSounds changed to one handed swords.\r\nSpeed: 1.000\r\nStagger: 1.1000\r\nReach: 1.300",
