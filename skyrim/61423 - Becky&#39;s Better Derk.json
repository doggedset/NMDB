  "descriptionHtml": "Derkeethus is one of the best followers/spouses in the game. Yet he still needed some work... at least to fit with my themed game. I had uploaded this file before, long before the Creation Kit was out. I&#39;m still not happy with this version, I couldn&#39;t get it to import his head, he was supposed to be a different color (black with gold under his eyes). Oh well, at least he stands out some more now.\r<br />\r<br />Changes:\r<br />He now has feathered &#39;hair&#39; as well as his horns.\r<br />He now wears hunter03 outfit.\r<br />He&#39;s a CombatBarbarian, meaning he favors 2 handed swords and bows.\r<br />His confidence level has been boosted.\r<br />Starts off with a Steel Greatsword.\r<br />As far as I know, he&#39;s been fixed by Bethesda (no longer wanders back to Darkwater Crossing if you marry him,) and if he&#39;s not, let me know I&#39;ll get rid of that in his AI. I&#39;ve never had the problem since I use AFT and My Home Is Your Home.\r<br />\r<br />What I use to make him look like this:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51097/?]Digitigrade Beasts and armors[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/7712/?]JazzJR&#39;s Argonian Retexture[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17339/?]Bigger Argonian Tails[/url]\r<br />These files above aren&#39;t REQUIRED but they improve the look. The only thing you need to make this work is Skyrim.",
