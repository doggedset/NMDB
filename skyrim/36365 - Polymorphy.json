NO DLC REQUIRED. Custom mods supported.\r<br />\r<br />v2 video by gamespot (most bugs in video have been fixed):\r<br />don&#39;t forget to watch other hilarious videos :)\r<br />If you make video send me link :3\r<br />[youtube]mcB8euTGz3g[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />How to use:\r<br />When loading your game you will receive the spells.\r<br />To set a form you need to cast the &#34;set form&#34; spell on a target.\r<br />To morph equip a morph spell and use shout key.\r<br />To revert back just press shout key again.\r<br />If you sneak before morphing, the morph retains it&#39;s natural allegiance (You can murder innocent villagers as a frost giant or just walk among bandits as a bandit).\r<br />\r<br />limitations:\r<br />-You cannot activate objects and some menu interfaces are disabled.\r<br />-To attack, approach an hostile target and you will attack automatically.\r<br />\r<br />known issues:\r<br />-you need to sheath your weapons or spells before morphing so that the camera works correctly.\r<br />-If you try to morph into a leveled actor the morph can get a little bit random.\r<br />-Sometimes you can&#39;t move because your morph plays an idle (giant scratching his back with club :3 )\r<br />\r<br />changelog:\r<br />29.7.2013 V5:\r<br />-Morphing and reverting is now a lot faster.\r<br />\r<br />v4:\r<br />-fixed a bug where npcs or creatures would start attacking morph for no reason.\r<br />\r<br />v3:\r<br />-fixed many morphs.\r<br />-Morphs are now closer to originals (attacks,equipment).\r<br />-if you sneak before morphing the morph retains it&#39;s natural allegiance (You can murder innocent villagers as a frost giant or just walk among bandits as a bandit).\r<br />-little bug fixes\r<br />\r<br />v2:\r<br />-when using v1, when you reverted from a morph you could not activate a lot of stuff. \r<br />If you encounter this issue, update to v2 and morph to fix.",
