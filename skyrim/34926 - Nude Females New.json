Extract it into your Skyrim data folder (this should be your Steam folder\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\steamapps\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\common\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\skyrim\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Data\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) or use the Nexus Mod Manager to install it. This will install the mod with the default Clean textures with pubic hair.\r\n\r\nIf you have done this correctly the mod should work ingame without any other hassle.\r\n\r\nIF YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED THE MESH-ONLY VERSION\r\n\r\nThe mesh only version does not contain any textures. If you have installed this, you will get the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"barbie doll\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" look. This mesh-only version allows you to choose which human/beast textures you want to use (including those textures made by other modders but utilising my mesh) without downloading ones you do not want. Install the mesh-only version, then install any textures you want to use as below.\r\n\r\nOPTIONAL TEXTURES\r\n\r\nTo install the optional textures, first make sure you have installed the main file as above. Then, extract your chosen textures into the same folder as above (Steam folder\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\steamapps\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\common\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\skyrim\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Data\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) or use the Nexus Mod Manager to install the optional files. This will overwrite the default mod textures with whichever optional textures you have chosen.\r\n\r\nREMOVING TEXTURES\r\n\r\nIf you want to remove any of the new textures just delete the relevant files, or unselect the mod in the Nexus Mod Manager. If textures are removed the game will revert to the original \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"barbie doll\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" textures if you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t delete the mesh as well.\r\n\r\nUNINSTALLING\r\n\r\nTo uninstall, just remove the installed files.
