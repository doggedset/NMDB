  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#efefef][size=3]\r<br />Arngeir is actually the first Dragonborn but he didn&#39;t tell us.Â \r<br />Paarthurnax is his father and he hates Alduin because he is not strong as he is.\r<br />\r<br />So he shouts to call you. You climb all the steps up so he can train you to kill the Alduin.\r<br />\r<br />It is pretty clear that Arngeir wants to be the strongest Dragonborn. But he doesn&#39;t know something.\r<br />The chicken at Riverwood is the actual Dragonborn.\r<br />\r<br />How did we get here? Let me explain you. I&#39;m out of imagination, it is really late.\r<br />\r<br />You want to learn what this mod does? Alright, I&#39;ll explain that one then. Will tell the story when the Imprefvicticious Odahviing comes.\r<br />\r<br />This mod enhances Arngeir&#39;s fathers textures and adds glowing lines on him. While installing, you get to choose between 5 different colors. Red, Blue, Pink, Deathwingish Orange and Yellow.\r<br />\r<br />If you didn&#39;t like the colors, you can just choose &#39;&#39;Enhanced Textures&#39;&#39; and have a better Paarthurnax.[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/mU05vpx.gif[/img][/center]\r<br />[center][size=3]Why do you think only Arngeir can talk to you? Start thinking son&#33;\r<br />You think you know everything?\r<br />\r<br />THE CHICKEN KNOWS EVERYTHING&#33;[/size][/center]",
