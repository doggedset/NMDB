  "summary": "I was a little fed up when I decided to join up with the Dawnguard at how useless their armor is if you\\'re at any decent level at all. So, I fixed them.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Basically my main goal in this was to rebalance the Dawnguard armor pieces. The heavy armor set is a disgrace, and the light armor isn\\'t much better. Now, the two sets are slightly above (1 or 2 points of base armor) Steel Plate and Scaled, respectively. I also changed the Rune Shield to not be so pathetic, and added a heavy variant. I don\\'t know how to add the heavy variant to, say, a crafting menu, so you could swap the two out, but I\\'ll look around.\r\n\r\nEventually, I want to expand this mod to the vampire armor, and *maybe* the weapons, though weapons seem to get modded a lot more than armor, so I might just leave them well enough alone. \r\n\r\nAlso, if you\\'re using the heavy set, for God\\'s sake, use this: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23935/",
