  "descriptionHtml": "I felt that the vanilla textures were a bit unrealistic, and had somewhat of a greenish tint to them that would not be found naturally on rusted metal. This texture set is an edited version of the originals, with a tint change, image sharpening, and a few added details. Enjoy!",
