  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE 1.2\r\nNew Dragonblood Mine added!\r\nAdded 4 more mannequins to sanctuary.\r\nAdded a stairway down the back balcony.\r\nChanged the dragon eyes on the front entrance. \r\nYOU WILL NEED TO RE-DISCOVER THE ENTRANCES!! I fixed them so they needed to be discovered like everything else.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 1.1\r\nFixed a couple issues with the lava and lighting. Download The Dragonblood Throne Updated file. Version 1.1\r\n\r\n\r\nNew video review from Blacks Mod Reviews! Thank you for your support!\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgzt96W2PSA&feature=c4-overview&list=UUJu88mOqFhobduyLDEVFdiw\r\nSorry for no high tech link or embed, im a big time forum noob haha :)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dragonblood Throne is a new player home in Skyrim!\r\n\r\nLocated atop the mountain just west of Whiterun, is a fortress fit for a Dragonborn. The entrance is located on the western side of the mountain, just look for the giant dragon head carved out of stone. \r\n\r\nInside lie two distinct areas; the throne room itself and the sanctuary.\r\nThe throne boasts Dwemer machinery powered by lava, while surrounded by dragon skeletons.\r\nThe sanctuary holds crafting stations for every profession, and multiple display cases and mannequins should keep the collectors happy. Two merchants can be found inside also. \r\n\r\nOutside on the mountain are multiple balcony's to afford the player spectacular views of the area. New mine added to exterior with update 1.2.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\nDawnguard, Dragonborn and Skyrim patch 1.9 are needed.\r\nOther than that this is a standalone plugin and should not affect any other in anyway. The exception would be another mod that changes the mountain that the fortress is built on.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nDownload The Dragonblood Throne.esp with NMM and your good to go.\r\nFor manual installation unzip the file and place it into your skyrim data folder. The path usually is (C:/programfiles/steam/steamapps/commom/skyrim/data)\r\n\r\nTo Uninstall:\r\nDelete TheDragonbloodThrone.esp from the skyrim data folder.\r\nWarning!!! if you uninstall it while you have items still on mannequins, display racks etc. they will be gone.\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\nExterior navmeshes around the mountain and balcony's are a mess, may affect followers ability to follow. I don't use followers so I wont bother fixing it.\r\nFor some reason the mannequins like to move, I have not seen it yet with this place but if it happens, just leave the cell and then enter it again.\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.2\r\n-fixed map icons being initially discovered\r\n\r\nUpdate 1.1\r\n-fixed lava damage in forge area\r\n-fixed lighting issues in sancutary (removed blue lights)\r\n\r\nThanks for everyone who makes mod videos and tutorials (big help btw)\r\nBig thanks to Bethesda for making Skyrim and the Elderscrolls series!!!!",
