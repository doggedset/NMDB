  "summary": "I saw someone comment that there aren&#39;t many CME saves out there for people who aren&#39;t very good at making faces, so I tried making one.",
  "descriptionHtml": "   Basically, I have 7base, Univision, SG texture, SG Hair pack (HelloSanta) , Eyes of Beauty... Actually, I may have more. Anyway, you only really need the hair, eyes and skin for her to look alright. And of course Enhanced Character Edit. To install, just put it in C:&#92;Users&#92;[your name]&#92;Documents&#92;My Games&#92;skyrim&#92;CME_save . To load it, use the slot load slider in the body tab. Currently she&#39;s named Hana (a lovely Jewish name that is also Japanese; I like using odd names) but I don&#39;t know if the load saves that as well. Personally, I expect no downloads at all. Enjoy.",
