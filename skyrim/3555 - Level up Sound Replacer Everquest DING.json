  "descriptionHtml": "Will probably be buried by other mods shortly but roaming the internet I discovered this sound file and was overcome with nostalgia =D\r\n\r\nSimply replaces the usual level up loop with the DING! from Everquest\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rozziland.com/eq/levelup.wav <- The sound and my source\r\n\r\nInstallation - Simple drag the content of the ZIP to your Skyrim install directory\r\nUninstallation - Delete the files you placed into your Skyrim install directory, either the entire \\\"Sound\\\" folder OR if you have other mods the ui_levelup.wav\r\n\r\nTested in game so it all good, and not too loud, the above link is rather loud, in game is seems to lower this volume =D",
