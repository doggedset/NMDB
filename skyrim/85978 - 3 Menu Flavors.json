  "descriptionHtml": "Hello.\r<br />\r<br />Here are 3 edited menu textures I really like, combined with the cool waterfall logo everybody is so crazy about. I too think it looks cool. \r<br />\r<br />INSTALL:\r<br />Choose one of the textures, and drop it into your skyrim/data/textures/interface/objects folder.\r<br />--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- \r<br />I also included my remix of my favorite menu song I edited years ago. Optional, if you want to use it, drop the music folder in your data \r<br />folder. (song starts up slow, then fast, then slow asf, then it becomes extremely cool, reflects this game perfectly)\r<br />I also included my edited menu meshes, where I combined the original skyrim menu smoke, with the snow particles. I wanted to have \r<br />snow AND smoke at the same time, so there you go, i did it. If you want \r<br />to use it, drop the meshes folder into your data folder.\r<br />\r<br />psst...nr 3 is the best if you ask me...personal preference though........still. Use that one :). WHY ? (it has the vanilla clean \r<br />feel, with added pictures &#34;from your adventures&#34;, the Skyrim name is \r<br />displayed at the bottom, and the logo is in the middle, again, vanilla \r<br />feel....only modded vanilla feel.)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00FF00]Bugs,[/color] Bunnies and the like,,maybe even Warner Bros...\r<br />---Maybe some ENB can cause problems with the image quality, audio quality etc, ...or the weather outside, ...or Donald Trump, or Korea and the Mexicans \r<br />dancing around the border wall may blur the picture, i dunno, i dont use ENB effects, never had, never will. There are some rumours that some people use\r<br /> 3 or even 5 enbs at the same time....just sayin....and they need to use 3d glasses and an Oculus Rift combined to be able to see whats going \r<br />on...just sayin. Add to that some SweetFX and you got yourself a [url=https://www.google.hu/search?safe=off&client=firefox-b-ab&q=quadruple&spell=1&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjbtpe-gdLVAhWDvBQKHaCFD3oQvwUIIygA][b][i]quadruple[/i][/b][/url]-A game.\r<br />\r<br />All rights reserved to the respective authors, and thanks to,\r<br />Bethesda - for Skyrim and menu smoke\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1066442]lozzer22[/url] - for the menu snow\r<br />google/piterest/deviantart - for the logos and pics\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/214871]rheadude[/url] - for the muntain picture\r<br />...all this was possible.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Dragons were never gone.
