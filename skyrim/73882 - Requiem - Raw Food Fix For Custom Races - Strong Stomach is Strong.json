  "summary": "In Requiem mod, custom beast races are affected by raw food just as bad as non-beast races, while vanilla beast races were OK with raw food, this fix removes this issue&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b]TL;DR[/b]\r<br />Just like vanilla beast races, after installation of this fix, custom beast races in Requiem won&#39;t receive negative effects of raw food any longer (assuming you use a proper Requiem custom race patch).\r<br />\r<br />[b]Longer, but read anyway:[/b]\r<br />When you add your custom beast race to Requiem and even use a proper race patch, you still cannot eat raw food without losing stamina. That happens due to the way Requiem is coded, but thanksfully the issue wasn&#39;t too difficult to fix.\r<br />Now the req_strongstomach keyword, which is recommended to use in custom beast race patches but never helped with the issue, is finally working with my fix&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The description of raw food is now changed to reflect the change this fix implements - from now on, the descritpion doesn&#39;t only mention Orcs, Argonians, Khajiit and Woodelves as in vanilla Requiem, but &#34;anyone whose race is known for strong stomach&#34; as well&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I tested the fix with both Lykaios (new custom race) and the vanilla Nord race. The three tested foods: potato, venison and bestial stew are now having proper effect on the respective races.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Requirements:[/b]\r<br />Link to custom race patches for Requiem (required for obvious reasons):\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58145/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58145/?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Link to Requiem (required for even more obvious reasons):\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281/?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation:[/b]\r<br />This is a simple .esp file, put it into your &#34;data&#34; folder.\r<br />Put this plugin [b]after [/b]Requiem in your loading order&#33;",
