  "summary": "A complete and total removal of the unbalanced wards from the NPC\\'s in Skyrim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "What this mod essentially does is completely remove all ward spells from the NPC\\'s the game. That\\'s right - all of them. (As of 1.2, player wards are still functional. NPC wards are completely removed)\r\n\r\n This is a choice I decided to make after playing the game for over 500 hours with stock Wards and afterward trying several Ward fixers myself. I was never happy with any of them. I found that the default wards in Skyrim turned NPC mages into complete tanks. Even the most lowly little necromancer would be rendered almost completely invulnerable while his ward was up. In my view, mages in Skyrim should be powerful but delicate. Mages already have the Flesh armor spells in the Alteration school to boost their armor rating so I feel that making them resistant (or even completely immune) to spells is just absurd.\r\n\r\nPLAYER WARDS are still functional. Please learn them from spell books.\r\n\r\n Notes:\r\n - Due to the fact that mages are now vulnerable to spells (their wards are really the only thing protecting them) you may find them much weaker at higher levels. I recommend using one of the many spell-damage enhancer mods for Skyrim so that they are more of a threat.",
