  "modName": "Longsword - Longer Dawnbreaker",
  "summary": "Turns Dawnbreaker into a real longsword, worthy of Dovahkiin! (And compatible with any of your favorite Dawnbreaker retextures!)",
  "descriptionHtml": "Ever felt that Dawnbreaker was a little...short? That it was more suited for little Arya Stark or Bilbo Baggins than the mighty, noble Champion of Meridia? \r\n\r\nThis mod seeks to correct that by increasing the length of Dawnbreaker so that it becomes a proper longsword, worthy of being wielded by the Last Dragonborn. \r\n\r\nBecause I didn\\'t do anything too weird to the model and didn\\'t touch the textures, it should be compatible with any Dawnbreaker retextures you may have. \r\n\r\nEnjoy! Comment and endorse :) \r\n\r\nNOTES\r\nI haven\\'t seen how the longer mesh looks when Dawnbreaker is embedded in its pedestal inside of Meridia\\'s temple. Also, I know that the blood mesh is wonky, and if I learn how to fix that (or if someone tells me how to do so :D) I will correct that.\r\n\r\nThank you!",
