  "summary": "Armor Replacer designed to mimic Katia Managan&#39;s armor (from prequeladventure.com).  CBBE version requires separate optional file for blue pants.  Latest (CHSBHC) version does not.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;ve learned a lot since I originally made this mod last year.  I just uploaded an update to this mod that improves it substantially over the earlier mod.  First, this mod is for the CHSBHC body.  It supports breast &#34;jiggle&#34; therefore.  Also, the blue pants are now included - no need for a separate mod for that, (which caused all female khajiits to wear blue pants all the time).\r<br />\r<br />Also, the back now conforms to the &#34;canon&#34; version as seen in Prequel Adventure webcomic.\r<br />\r<br />Since this update is for CHSBHC, that mod is a prerequisite.  Not really sure what would happen if you didn&#39;t have it installed first.\r<br />\r<br />Required:\r<br />Cherry Hotaling&#39;s CHSBHC body mod - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/4888\r<br />\r<br />Suggested:\r<br />MrLenski&#39;s CoverKhajiits mod (for improved face) - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5941\r<br />Tktk&#39;s Pretty Khajiit (for big eyes) - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17040\r<br />Crashmaster Jmm & Derok&#39;s Female Khajiit Tail Fix (moves tail up out of CHSBHC&#39;s larger butt) - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/46491\r<br />My optional Katia Nude texture mod (here) - (mostly just makes female khajiits more yellow and gives them a pale chest area as in Katia&#39;s design)\r<br />\r<br />HOW TO USE:\r<br />\r<br />This is an armor replacer.  Specifically it replaces Linwe&#39;s armor.  I chose that to replace primarily because it&#39;s fairly rare, so you won&#39;t end up seeing lots of people walking around in Katia&#39;s armor.  You can either get it from Linwe by quest: (A light armor similar to the Thieves Guild Armor or Guild Master&#39;s Armor Set, obtained by looting or pickpocketing Linwe at Uttering Hills Cave) OR you can cheat via this at the console:\r<br />player.additem 00108544 1\r<br />\r<br />WHAT TO EXPECT:\r<br />If you then don the Linwe armor, you&#39;ll get Katia&#39;s armor.  \r<br />\r<br />WHAT NOT TO EXPECT:\r<br />Perfection.  I&#39;m getting some clipping when at higher weight sizes.  Pretty minor IMHO.\r<br />\r<br />THANKS TO:\r<br />Cherry Hotaling for CHSBHC.  Still the sexiest mod in my opinion and the first with breast jiggle.\r<br />MrLenski, for outlandishly detailed textures&#33;\r<br />Tktk, for Pretty Khajiit mod and nice, big eyes that inspired the idea that a somewhat Katia-like player character COULD be done.\r<br />Crashmaster Jmm & Derok - for tail mover, really needed for CHSBHC Khajiits&#33;\r<br />KAZERAD - for making prequeladventure.com and such a lovable character as Katia, enough to get me off my butt and try and make this thing&#33;\r<br />\r<br />HOW TO INSTALL:\r<br />I tested it with Nexus Mod Manager and it appears to work as expected, but I&#39;m personally a fan of doing these things manually sometimes.  Just extract and copy the data folder into your main game folder.\r<br />\r<br />STILL TO COME:\r<br />A couple thing&#39;s I&#39;d LIKE to do. Whether or not I actually will is another question.  First, the blue bodysuit is so form-fitting that its...well... it&#39;s paint essentially.  I&#39;ll need to learn 3ds max better to be able to adjust that and get the suit out of her ass.  In fact, I like it this way but I&#39;m weird like that.  I&#39;d also like to fix the clipping issues.\r<br />\r<br />ADULT ONLY?\r<br />I removed the Katia texture mod file so that I can un-adult-only this mod.\r<br />\r<br />BLUE BODY SUIT OPTIONAL MOD\r<br />My older attempt at this required an optional Blue Body Suit mod to look right.  This one (CHSBHC) doesn&#39;t.  But since I&#39;m leaving the CBBE version up, I&#39;ll leave that up to.  Sort of obsolete in my opinion though.\r<br />\r<br />1 - Install CHSBHC mod. (required for breast animation)\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/4888\r<br />2 - Install CoverKhajiits. (optional for much nicer Khajiit faces)\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5941\r<br />3 - Install Pretty Khajiit.  (optional for big eyes like Katia) \r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17040\r<br />4 - Install Tail Fix mod (optional but your kitty may squeal if you don&#39;t get that tail out of her butt&#33;).\r<br />\r<br />Obtain Linwe armor either in-game or via console command shown above.  Wear armor.  See Katia armor.  Profit.",
