The feedback has been mostly positive, and as always much appreciated. Sorry that I haven&#39;t updated any of my mods in quite some time. I hope that in the near future my schedule will start to allow for a little more time for my hobbies. I am also hoping that I will be getting a much better PC, which will not only inspire me to get back into Skyrim. But hopefully also allow me to do more as far as my modding is concerned. Thanks again, you guys are the best&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />      [size=5]This is a body preset I made for Bodyslide2 and OutfitStudio. The preset is obviously CBBE so it is compatible with all of the CBBE armor and clothing mods available. I included the CBBE hand and feet meshes. I also included the CBBE first person nif files. I didn&#39;t include any of the textures though, you guys usually just end up changing them any way. However you should be able to use any skin textures you like. As long as they are compatible with the CBBE body of course. As well as any mod that alters the hand and feet meshes. Given they are made with CBBE compatibility. I hope you guys enjoy it.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]Recommendation[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]If you are not using these textures, you really should be. This is by far my favorite, and in my opinion. If you want to get the most out of this body, this is the texture set you should be using.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51602/?]Fair Skin Complexion[/url][size=5] By:HHaleyy[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00]Special Thanks:[/color]\r<br />[size=5]I would like to thank my friend Simclarke for the amazing images.
