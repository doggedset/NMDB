  "descriptionHtml": "Saved Breton I made after you escape the dragon and to the first town in the beginning. She followed Ralof. \r\nCan modify her by using \\\" ~ \\\" key and typing .showracemenu\r\n*note* showracemenu will erase all makeup and i believe drop her to Lv1 \r\n\r\nI had added some things as this is the save I was using myself, so she has some gear, a few stats in archery, one and two handed to 40 each and sneak to 100. Also has increased baggage space, over a mil and about 1000 lockpicks. feel free to drop this stuff if you dislike it, I was only using simple console commands(http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Console_Commands_%28Skyrim%29) though the skills i did beating the crap out of poor Ralof(he makes a great sparring partner!)\r\n\r\nTo play, put file in my games > skyrim > saves\r\n\r\n\r\nTo achieve the full look I used the following mods(forgive me im kinda new to all this ^^:)\r\n\r\nNo More Blocky Faces by Xenius\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=30#content (blocky faces)\r\n\r\nProper Clean Female Body by Imrinfected\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=43#content\r\n\r\nLess Ugly Elven Faces by Arlekin (also breton)\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=29#content\r\n\r\nImproved Female Skin Textures by Volek\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=58#content\r\n\r\ncredits to those guys for making it possible to look good XD <3",
