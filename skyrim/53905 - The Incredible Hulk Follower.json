  "summary": "Adds Incredible Hulk as a follower outside Riverwood with a spare set of armor.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a unique follower to Skyrim, based on the Marvel character, Bruce Banner, The Incredible Hulk, The Monster, The Green Giant&#33; \r<br />\r<br />This is for Male Only. \r<br />\r<br />You&#39;ll find him outside Riverwood. He will level with the player and is a warrior but should just use his fists and has his own perks. \r<br />\r<br />Furthermore, it adds an second set of armor. \r<br />\r<br />*************************************************** \r<br />The Armour: \r<br />Based around the Iron armour retextured with the Silver, and blue scheme of Hulk. It&#39;s unenchanted, and can only be crafted under the Iron section of the Sky Forge, and tempered as usual at the workbench. Stat-wise it&#39;s a little stronger than Iron Armour. \r<br />Note the set is standalone, and not a replacer of the Iron armour. Although it&#39;s based on the iconic Hulk pants of Marvel, i&#39;ve attempted to make it look more armor based, more in keeping with Skyrim. It&#39;s about as lore-friendly as you can get. \r<br />\r<br />************************************************** \r<br />Compatibility & Troubleshooting \r<br />\r<br />The armour should not conflict with anything else. \r<br />**************************************************\r<br />Installation: \r<br />Simply extract the archive into the Skyrim folder, so the .esp, textures folder, and meshes folder all land into your skyrim/data directory. \r<br />Typically: \r<br />C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim \r<br />\r<br />C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim",
