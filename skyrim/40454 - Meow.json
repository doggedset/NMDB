He is good with both bow and sword and he can heal himself (however he is a essential character, so he can\\'t really die) I\\'m working on other follower mods, including one that would bring back a follower from TES IV Oblivion. (I\\'m not telling who yet) + I will keep working om M\\'eow and maybe even give him some friends :) \r\n\r\nHave fun :) ",
