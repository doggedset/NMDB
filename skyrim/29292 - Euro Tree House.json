Well now that is possible. I use many player house mods since I started playing Skyrim, but a downside to them was that i never had enough mannequins or display cases and racks to admire my loot, so I made my own mod. If you like it, endorse it and maybe recommend it to a friend.\r\n\r\nThis is not perfect, you may still find some graphical bugs here and there, there are no scripts involved, except for the Vanilla ones and the Mannequins kind of move sometimes. Also the lighting might also fail in some corners of the main cell. Keep in mind that this is my first mod and that I will try to correct any mistakes you guys find by exploring the surroundings. This is not a mod for everyone, since I made it more to resemble a Museum / Hall of Valor rather than just a simple house. Besides, this isn\\'t even your house, or a player house, but you are allowed to reside in it until the former owner \\\"returns\\\".\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1120.photobucket.com/albums/l495/seularts/Footprints-Separator_zpsa84dc624.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1120.photobucket.com/albums/l495/seularts/Ainstall_zps9111cb78.png[/img]\r\nJust paste the content of the archive in you Skyrim folder, or just use the Mod Manager for an easy and fast install.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1120.photobucket.com/albums/l495/seularts/Ahow_zps38466c6e.png[/img]\r\nIt\\'s easy, just go left/west of Whiterun until you see a Big Tree and you also have a map marker to find it easier.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1120.photobucket.com/albums/l495/seularts/Footprints-Separator_zpsa84dc624.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1120.photobucket.com/albums/l495/seularts/abug_zpsec1fb814.png[/img]\r\nI couldn\\'t find any incompatibility between my mod any other mods so far, but I\\'m still testing. If you guys find something wrong be sure to leave a comment so I can investigate.\r\n[center][img]http://i1120.photobucket.com/albums/l495/seularts/abugr_zps3a8c6fb2.png[/img][/center]\r\nIf by any chance you have a less stronger PC, I recommend using the \\\"pcb\\\" command (without the quotes [\\\"]) inside a cell, in other words a cave/house/etc, so you can free some of that cache the game is storing up. Of course this might result in a reset of the mannequins that will unequip the items you have stored on them so you will have to retrieve and add the items again so they can equip it back on. I know it sucks, but it\\'s the safest way there is so far.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Known issues generated by the Creation Kit (CK):[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]A.[/b] Crazy Mannequins move around » use recommended Vanilla mod fix.\r\n\r\n[b]B.[/b] Weapon Racks may sometime disable the possibility of retrieving the stored weapon » use \\\"tcl\\\" command (without the quotes [\\\"]) in order to find the best angle to pick your weapon up.\r\n\r\n[b]C.[/b] Bookshelves won\\'t store all your books, or just show you that there are 0 (zero) available book spaces left » I didn\\'t find any resolution to this problem. This is based on luck I guess, CK  screwed up big time here.\r\n\r\n[b]D.[/b] Sometimes Followers won\\'t get inside the Tree House cell » I have no idea why, but there should be no problems regarding the mesh of the cell or anything preventing the follower to get in, on the other hand the follower will be waiting for you outside.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1120.photobucket.com/albums/l495/seularts/Footprints-Separator_zpsa84dc624.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1120.photobucket.com/albums/l495/seularts/Aalso_zps3c740b7d.png[/img]\r\n\r\n» [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10652]Vanilla Mannequin Script Fix[/url] :: keeps mannequins in place and allows them to equip weapons as well ::\r\n\r\n» [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27644]Immersive Weapons[/url] & [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19733]Immersive Armors[/url] + [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21163]Immersive Armors for NPCs[/url]\r\n\r\n» [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5727]Isilmeriel LOTR Weapons Collection[/url] + [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29730/]Isilmeriel LOTR Weapons Retextures[/url]\r\n\r\n» [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1754]Weapon Retexture Project[/url] :: enhances the Vanilla weapon sets ::\r\n\r\n» [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27959]ATTK Skyrim Power Loader[/url]\r\n\r\n» [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2531]AntiFREEZE performance patch 9 ENBSeries[/url]\r\n\r\n» [url=http://code.google.com/p/better-oblivion-sorting-software/]BOSS Plugin[/url] :: for a smoother gameplay experience ::\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1120.photobucket.com/albums/l495/seularts/Amisc_zpsf7565e0a.png[/img]\r\n\r\n» [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15129]Lilliths Moon Collecion[/url] + [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/367]The Dragon Moons[/url]\r\n\r\n» [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/85]Enhanced Night Skyrim[/url] + [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25022]Shooting Stars[/url]\r\n\r\n» [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27371]Better Dialogue Controls[/url]\r\n\r\n» [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28583]Fantasy music overhaul[/url]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1120.photobucket.com/albums/l495/seularts/Footprints-Separator_zpsa84dc624.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1120.photobucket.com/albums/l495/seularts/Aextra_zpsdfafc3ca.png[/img]\r\nI am opened to suggestions regarding the improvement of this mod.
