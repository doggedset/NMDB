  "summary": " This mod brings a Giant nord hostler known as Malashem to Skyrim as he will sell to you a grey maned horse just outside of Winterhold. With additional updates there will be additional stables, and further hostler characters added. (All using unique voice-overs done by myself) Plus: I created a unique voice-type for SkulvarSableHilt.",
  "descriptionHtml": " Along with the giant nord hostler known as Malashem in Winterhold; there is also a hostler whom goes by the name of Walt who is located just past the farm in Rorikstead. Walt is a character that has been utilized in several scenarios and themes over the years, and is now immortalized here in Skyrim. The default hostler SkulvarSableHilt now has a unique voice-type as well. (All the voice-types for this mod are done by myself.) There will be more added as this mod develops. Feedback that will aid in this mod becoming the best it can is encouraged.  - Dionysus10",
