  "descriptionHtml": "Upon request from the Steam workshop I\\'ve uploaded this to the nexus, ive had this out for some time just never thought to upload it here, but in any case this lets players who are in favor of using light armor better utilize General Tulius\\'s Armor since its considered Heavy Armor in Skyrim. Simple fix, small, mod but if you download it i hope you enjoy it :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPermissions: if anyone for whatever reason need to use for anything feel free i have no objections except credit me as the original author, otherwise feel free to use my mod",
