  "descriptionHtml": "Hi,\r\nThank you for downloading and trying my Mod.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1\r\nFixed CTD issue some people were experiencing (File Header fixed)\r\nAdded Arrow Description\r\n\r\nDownload and install with Nexus Mod Manager or install .esp file in your Skyrim\\\\Data Folder\r\n\r\nTo obtain SoulMaster\\'s Doom Bow and Soul Arrows go to Arcadia\\'s Cauldron in Whiterun and there will be a new chest inside by the door.\r\nThe Doom Bow is very powerful although not as insanely so as the first mod! (SoulMaster\\'s Dread Bow)\r\nBoth the Bow and Soul Arrows are fully craftable (Daedric for the Bow, Misc for the Arrows)\r\nI hope you have fun with them?!\r\nPlease feel free to leave any comments you may have\r\n\r\nI have uploaded my Player House Mod here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27338\r\nThis includes a slightly less powerful version of the Bow and Arrows. Feel free to give it a try! :) \r\n\r\nOther Mods I have done:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27599\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27591\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26099\r\n\r\n[color=#00FFFF]Please take note: If you are using a pirated (ie non Steam enabled) version of the game, please do not leave comments about how this part of my mod or that is not working on your game! I am not prepared to waste my time trying to help you out with your illegal software! I\\'m unemployed, but still manage to pay for my games (they are what keep me sane) so if I can, you should be able to as well![/color]\r\n\r\nSoulMasterII\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1154.photobucket.com/albums/p535/mike_patrick1/sm0g9rv24znf_zps9d795d9a.gif[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF00]Please, DO NOT upload any part of my mods anywhere else![/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n",
