  "summary": "magic runes replacer",
  "descriptionHtml": "this tiny mod replaces all the magic runes. if you have some kind of mod that has runes i dont know about and you want me to make them then just ask. \r<br />or if you want a custom version let me know. what i wont do is make one attached to a kunai.. i dont like naruto sorry.\r<br />anyway i know other people have made really awsome looking runes already, yes yes i know and if you like them better then simply use them.\r<br />as for me i like mines for the theme im playing thats why i made them, and i wanted to make them from the moment i 1st saw rune magic which i believe was way back in the day a mod for oblivion.\r<br />not lore friendly is what people away say about my mods but i can always debate that, you see since morrowind atlest- magic has been enchanted into or cast upon more then just armor and weapons, but scrolls, doors, locks even chests. so tell me why is it so unlore friendly to believe that my character whom seeks out akavir knowledge wouldnt enchant a card/tag? that doesnt seem to crazy to believe if you ask me.\r<br />and akaviri are surely japanese influenced, so is it that the kanji is unlorefriendly? if not then why would this be unfriendly.. elder scrolls is filled with many cultures that mirror our own world.\r<br />on another note if youre wondering why is there a glow fire/ice/lightening/so on effect on it, is it a mistake? no at 1st i was going to remove it but i ended up liking how it looked, it looks to me like its heavily enchanted and keeping the magic bound yet lightly revealing its power. also i can make them smaller if people want however the smaller they are the more blury they will be, i cant make them sharp and tiny. maybe someone else can.\r<br />anyway hope you guys like and not to many show their malice. \r<br />also I highly recommend you get your self a mod that allows you to cast more then just one rune at a time.. because I don&#39;t know about you but I like to cast them all over the place.",
