  "descriptionHtml": "READ THIS BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD!!!!!\n<br />\n<br />I did not make this mod; I just found it online while looking for Witcher mods after binge-playing the whole trilogy. In fact, I don't even know who made it. Some of the armors look pretty good, and others have missing textures. I AM WELL AWARE OF THE ONES WITH MISSING TEXTURES. The armors in the pictures are not all of the armors this mod adds; I just picked a few random ones to demonstrate. When I initially downloaded this mod, it had SO MANY ESP FILES, so I simply merged them all into one esp file.",
