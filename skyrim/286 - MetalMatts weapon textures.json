  "summary": "I\\'m a new texture artist trying my hands out on Skyrim. I\\'ll be doing most if not all weapons in game.  I only have an iron dagger to start, but will add more progressively.",
  "descriptionHtml": "NOTE: In the initial release (v.0.01) only the iron dagger is complete. I will add more very soon in probably a day or two depending if I am busy or not.\r\n\r\nBasically this is just a pack of weapon textures. Double the standard resolution. All textures will be original, not just the default sharpened and upscaled. You may like them, or you may not.\r\n\r\nI\\'m a total noob with textures. Haven\\'t done anything with textures besides minecraft. Comments and ratings are highly appreciated. Constructive criticism would be a great help for me and this pack. My main goal is to gain experience with textures so I can make better ones in the future. \r\n\r\nInstallation: Extract the RAR file with WinRAR or 7zip. Then drag the \\\"textures\\\" file into your Data folder.",
