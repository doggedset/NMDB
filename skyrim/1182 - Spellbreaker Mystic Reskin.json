  "descriptionHtml": "[i][u][b]HD VERSION [/b][/u][/i]: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49175\r<br />\r<br />Re-skinned and Improved the resolution of the shield texture for the Spell Breaker. Added glow map and improved the environmental map.  Added a different color scheme to the shield itself for a more magic-esque look. \r<br />\r<br />Note: Glowmaps DO not work, as the custom mesh is missing from the files. Have to wait on that for now. The new mesh system that Bethesda has implemented actually attaches shader data to them. So until either the Niftools gets implementation in, or Bethesda puts out some really useful tools in the Creation Kit, no glow maps to work with. \r<br />\r<br />Update 1.3- WIP : Update will be coming soon with some enhanced meshes and an ESP file for some stat enhancements for the spell breaker.  Also if anyone has figured out what needs to be done to make sure textures aren&#39;t overridden by the new Hi-res pack, please message me&#33;\r<br />\r<br />-Update 1.2: Cleaned up the main texture. Added different blue scheme to the front of the shield to match the crystal. 1.2 download comes with a second version that is more golden in appearance. See the new screenshot for a comparison to the new default. \r<br />\r<br />- Update 1.1 : Made the backside of the shield more Hi-Res. Cleaned up mapping. Metal is more shiny/reflective. Has glow maps, normals and environment maps. Textures are in 1024x1024\r<br />  \r<br />- Update 1.0a  : Changed the purple color on the outer part of the shield to more of a Pale Blue. Closer to the original texture color. For those that aren&#39;t fond of Purple. \r<br />\r<br />-Installation : Extract to SteamSteamappsCommonSkyrim \r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation : Delete the folder in caps - SkyrimDataTexturesArmorSPELLBREAKER &lt;--delete it\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />- Comments and feedback are welcomeencouraged. Hope you like it&#33; ",
