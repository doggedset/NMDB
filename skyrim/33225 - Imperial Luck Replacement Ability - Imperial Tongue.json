  "summary": "An alternative racial ability that replaces \\\\\\\"Imperial Luck\\\\\\\" with a persuasion bonus.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I got tired of the silly and lore-ignoring \\\\\\\"Imperial Luck\\\\\\\" power. That and the Imperial race doesn\\\\\\'t have speech bonus for some reason, even though they do in both Morrowind and Oblivion.\r\n\r\nSo basically this just makes all Persuasion checks 20% easier for imperial characters, meaning you can persuade people with less speechcraft skill than other races would need for the same speech check, thereby creating the trademark diplomatic element to the Imperial race.\r\n\r\n\r\nPossible bugs and Incompatibilities:\r\n\r\n- This will probably be incompatible with any other alterations to the Imperial passive abilities, since this alters the Imperial Luck script directly.\r\n\r\n- I\\\\\\'m also not sure if this stacks with the persuasion perk. it\\\\\\'ll either stack for a full 50% bonus, or the \\\\\\\"Persuasion\\\\\\\" perk will override the Imperial ability for a 30% bonus.",
