  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple modification to the bard&#39;s shared song script, which prevents them from selecting any songs on their own that require singing. As a result, they will cycle through more immersive, pleasantly ambient drum, lute, and flute music instead, and no one will have to flee at top speed from inns any longer&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Songs can still be requested in case you run a Makulah mod, or just want to torture your roommate.\r<br />\r<br />SCRIPT FILE WAS MISSING IN .rar OF INITIAL RELEASE; PLEASE DOWNLOAD CURRENT VERSION. :)\r<br />A no flute songs option is also available for those who don&#39;t like the shrillness. \r<br />\r<br />Feedback/comments/requests welcome&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />::UPCOMING CHANGES/VERSIONS::\r<br />* Looking into request to lower volume of flute songs. \r<br />*Instrument-specific installs: don&#39;t want flute? There will be no flute. Only want drums? We&#39;ve got that, too.",
