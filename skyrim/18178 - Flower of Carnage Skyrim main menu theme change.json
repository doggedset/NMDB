  "descriptionHtml": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRIE-txyA3w.- Hear the song here.\r\n\r\nFirst mod. Simple. The song is \\' The Flower of Carnage \\' a japanese song made by Mieko Kaji. Also the song is featured in one of my most favorite movies ; Kill Bill Vol. 1 during the scene where Kiddo kills O\\'ren near the end of the film. Why am I making this mod? Cause I like the song for one and I am more then certain other people out there want different music to play when they launch the game. I choose this one cause it\\'s my personal start. I will take requests for music changes if you wish all ya have to do is ask in the comments.   - I do not own the song, DO NOT SUE -",
