  "descriptionHtml": "[s][b]First:[/b]\r<br />[u]This mod is for those who cares for wearing their equipment. Its still not race-friendly and this can still be done with console alone.[/u][/s]\r<br />\r<br />[Changes]\r<br />Beta: Uses only external temptress(UNP) race and succubus(UNP) race to switch bodies.\r<br />U1: Succubus Race removed. Replaced with CBBE Human Vanilla Races. Turning into vampire with the disease still require console for now.\r<br />U2: Added ADEC Human Vanilla Races.\r<br />U3: Remove Temptress Race. Added UNP Human Vanilla Races.\r<br />U3Update: Added UNPB Human Vanilla Races.\r<br />U4Update: Added CBBEv3m Human Vanilla Races.\r<br />U5Update: Added CHSBHC Human Vanilla Races.\r<br />U6Update: This mod is now revamped.\r<br />- Added SevenBase Human Vanilla Races.\r<br />- Added Elves CBBE and UNP Races.\r<br />- Added Built-in Vampire Compatibility for races of different bodies.\r<br />- Added customization of up to 100 types of bodies per race.\r<br />- Added customization of adding up different bodies for custom races.\r<br />- Uses .esm file now due to customization reasons.\r<br />Modder&#39;s update:  Made a readme for those who wants to add custom bodies for vanilla races.\r<br />\r<br />This very small mod is my way of wearing different bodies of equipment sets in game. It uses a spell that allows you to switch your body. In the spell: It checks whether you are a vampire and lets you change bodies according. &#34;Revert&#34; means to change your race back to the original. For now, not all options in the spell are working, only bodies added from the updates are working.\r<br />\r<br />Console codes for getting the spell(only way to get it):\r<br />\r<br />XX000D64 - Spell Name: Body Change\r<br />\r<br />Mod requirements:\r<br />None Now.\r<br />\r<br />Issue:\r<br />-[size=5]I STILL don&#39;t know why the non vamp races all have the same color when switched to those races.[/size] Human colored orcs is notable but not the orc vampire. Feel free to help it by commenting thanks.\r<br />- Body parts might appear missing sometimes when using XPMSE or XPMS, restart game/re-enable this mod if that happens.\r<br />- Beast races not done yet. Elves may have texture problems.\r<br />- Sadly i cant bring the animations of the BBP in yet. So do not expect much from the CHSBHC body now except able to wear the armor made from it D: .I probably need FNIS.\r<br />- Vampire compatibility not tested with other vampire mods yet .\r<br />\r<br />Downsides of this mod:\r<br />[s]Your Powers and active effects will be slightly messed up.[/s]\r<br />\r<br />Plans?:\r<br />I will no longer be adding more bodies in since i added customization.\r<br />[s]Bodies without physics will be done first.[/s]\r<br />Anyone knows links of textures with the correct race colors?\r<br />Comment if any problems.\r<br />Updates (looking from contents in comments) would be coming bit by bit.\r<br />[b]UPDATE: Any mod support needed? Comment.[/b]",
