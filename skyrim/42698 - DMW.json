I will ignore those who tell me that weapons are missing especially the ones that are not craftable.These have been tested by others and confirmedto be where i have stated. The non craftable weapons are in certain locations. If you cant read past the first few lines then thats not my fault. \r<br />As stated above some weapons are not craftable. these weapons have been placed in locations relevant to the text I have written for them. these weapons arnt really that hard to find and you will most likey come across them in your questing. they are found in quest orientated locations, so no random caves crawls to find them.\r<br />\r<br />Locations of the Non Craftable ones are listed at the bottom of the page.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />1.
