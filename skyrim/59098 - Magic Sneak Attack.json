  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=6][i][b]Magic Sneak Attack[/b][/i][/size][/center]\r<br />[youtube]Nv0_khWJV9w[/youtube][center][/center][center][/center][youtube]FlEiM1BMa9U[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]What is this?[/b][/size]\r<br />This mod grants you a 3x damage bonus for magic attacks done while undetected. You&#39;ll hear the sneak-attack sound and see the on-screen sneak-attack message, just like you would when sniping someone with a bow. Magic sneak attacks will also level the Sneak skill.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]Why should I download this mod?[/b][/size]\r<br />Other mods that add sneak attack bonuses for magic mess with the Sneak perk tree. This one doesn&#39;t. Also, some of those mods don&#39;t actually work. This one does.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Does this edit/add any perks?[/size][/b]\r<br />No. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]Is it compatible with ___?[/b][/size]\r<br />Yes. If fill-in-the-blank mod ALSO adds a sneak attack bonus for magic, however, your stealthy mage will probably be OP.\r<br />[size=4][b]\r<br />\r<br />I hit someone with a fireball while sneaking but it didn&#39;t do any bonus damage&#33; What the heck?&#33;[/b][/size]\r<br />Magic is loud. And colorful. THIS MEANS THE BANDIT YOU&#39;RE ATTACKING IS VERY LIKELY TO NOTICE YOU SLINKING AROUND UNDER THE STAIRS IF YOU TRY TO HIT HIM IN THE FACE WITH A FIREBALL. Morale of the story: if the on-screen eye is open and says &#39;detected&#39; before your spell hits, you&#39;ve been caught and there will be no magic sneak bonus for you. \r<br />\r<br />Hint: The Quiet Casting perk is your friend.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]My mod-added Restoration Death-Mage spell didn&#39;t get a sneak-attack bonus&#33; [/b][/size]\r<br />ONLY spells that are tagged as being fire, ice, or shock will give you a sneak-attack bonus. Mostly, this is stuff in the Destruction school. Why not have EVERY spell get a sneak attack bonus, you ask? Simple. Imagine you&#39;re an Illusion mage, and just by slinking around in the shadows your Calm spell is suddenly 3x more powerful and can tame a dragon. Pretty OP, I&#39;d say. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]\r<br />REQUIREMENTS:[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />-Skyrim (NOT a pirated copy)\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]\r<br />How to Install:[/b][/size]\r<br />**I recommend downloading manually and then loading the file into NMM. Because NMM downloading speeds are terrible right now.**\r<br />\r<br />1) Download manually or via NMM\r<br />2) Install w/ NMM OR drag-and-drop everything in the zip file into your Skyrim/Data folder\r<br />3) ???\r<br />4) Profit&#33;",
