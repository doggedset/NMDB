  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6]Banks of Skyrim[/size]\r<br />Have you ever wondered why there are no banks in Skyrim where you can safely store and protect your gold from all the thieves, pickpocket-happy people, Guards using the good ol&#39; arrow in the knee tactic to steal your gold, and beggars all across Skyrim?  Well, those times are over now&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Banks of Skyrim adds a bank (from scratch created buildings) at each Hold with more features being added as I learn to do more with the Creation Kit.\r<br />\r<br />Each building is in the style of the hold it&#39;s settled, so you won&#39;t see a Whiterun-themed building in Solitude for lore-friendliness. :)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Current features:[/b]\r<br />- Walk into one of the buildings and safely store your gold. \r<br />- Lore friendly design buildings so they don&#39;t look silly.\r<br />- A vault with a huge amount of Gold that&#39;s heavily guarded. (Exact numbers? Try figuring it out yourself ^^)\r<br />- Unique objects only found in this mod&#33; \r<br />- More as time goes by...\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b] PLEASE NOTE [/b]\r<br />If you are using any mod that alters anything around the holds, it will conflict with the design.\r<br />\r<br />For example, if you&#39;re using True Skyrim, you may see a tree sticking out, or other odd looking things.",
