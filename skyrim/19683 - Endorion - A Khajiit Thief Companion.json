He will do anything the usual followers do, but he has a little extra weapons, forged by himself, for, you guessed it - himself. Endorion is standing just next to the Talos Worshipper in Whiterun, dressed with Shrouded Armor. He wears some nice weapons including a special dagger, bow and some normal daedric arrows. If you wish to kill him, he will drop his weapons and the armor.\r\n\r\nHave fun!",
