  "descriptionHtml": "&#39;From the shards of tattered dreams i rose, unwilling. tossed upon tides of pain which flowed and ebbed, leaving me searingly awake, and more revoltingly alive&#33;&#39; -kain\r<br />\r<br />EDIT: Im not dead, i just got super busy stuff going on... work stuff.\r<br />Thanks, sorry and do what you want with these files :)\r<br />\r<br />============================================================\r<br />DESCRIPTION\r<br />============================================================\r<br />\r<br />If you don&#39;t know anything about Kain i recommend you buy all five legacy of Kain games right now.\r<br />Its been over seven years since i uploaded elder Kain for morrowind http://morrowind.nexusmods.com/mods/37578 and time has come yet again for Kain to grace his presence in a Tamriel. \r<br />Warning i used really high details for this mod so it might be slow on lower end pcs.\r<br />If he is naked when you meet him trade with him to activate the stuff he has on him, i have no idea why that is happening.\r<br />\r<br />You can find him hanging out at riften black briar manor, his armor is in a barrel in the same building.\r<br />To reunite Kain with the Soul reaver download this mod by Spazthemax\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14985\r<br />\r<br />This mod is a huge wip so i expect you to find bugs (cloak being one of them and i just noticed it looking at the screenshots). Im working on making Kains race more playable with a female variant. I plan on a few things including\r<br />- Blood omen 2 armor\r<br />- Pre fallen Raziel armor (not sure how i skin his cloak)\r<br />- The sanctuary of the clans or the pillars of Nosgoth pre Bloodomen \r<br />- Vorador race\r<br />- Maybe Raziel, im not sure anyone would actually play him.\r<br />Most of what i have planned i had ready for Oblivion so i just need to update it.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION\r<br />============================================================\r<br />Unzip into the Data folder Or drag all the contents into the Data folder tick the mod in the Skyrim launcher.\r<br />\r<br />============================================================\r<br />USAGE\r<br />============================================================\r<br />I do not grant permission for reuse or repurpose of assets in this mod or alterations to the .esp file at this time as it is still a beta.\r<br />\r<br />============================================================\r<br />CONTACT\r<br />============================================================\r<br />you can contact me here or the elder of scrolls forums as Cohagen.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />============================================================\r<br />Credits\r<br />============================================================\r<br />ME\r<br />Bethesda created the base assets for most everything I altered and used in this mod.\r<br />The base of the skin texture I altered was created by Chris57.\r<br />Hanaisse, AlphaWoIF and dudeinmask  for their help.\r<br />\r<br />I am not the creator of legacy of kain\r<br />Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver, bloodomen are registered trademarks and copyrighted Square Enix i beleive. \r<br />\r<br />============================================================\r<br />Q&A with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/7566080]IAmMonolith[/url] \r<br />============================================================\r<br />INVISIBLE ARMOUR AND PROBLEMS FINDING ARMOUR\r<br />\r<br />Ok, now that the caps got your attention....\r<br />If you can&#39;t find Kains armour. He has it in his inventory. He just enjoys his nakedness while he&#39;s not your follower. \r<br />I mean....he&#39;s traveled through time and been killed, brought back to life, ruled the world, seen his race get destroyed..... he sort of deserves to be naked on his days off...\r<br />\r<br />But yeah, when he&#39;s a companion, you&#39;ll see it in his inventory and he&#39;ll equip it.\r<br />\r<br />And if the armor is invisible and all you see is a floating bald head along with a massive bow. We&#39;ll then...Kain does have a series of vampiric powers...\r<br />You just have to up date the mod. Download the update in the files section.\r<br />\r<br />Installation is easy enough. If you dont use a mod manager then, install as usual and replace any existing files that the original mod made. \r<br />If you use NMM then just install it, activate it along with the main mod and allow it to use the newer files in place of the main one.\r<br />\r<br />Your bad ass vampire companion will follow you and will be visible and dressed appropriately &lt;3",
