  "summary": "With this mod, you are able to set a skillpoint on \\'Daedric Smithing\\' after you learned to craft the \\'Dragon Armor\\'. Now you can set a skillpoint on \\'Ebony Smithing\\' after you get the \\'Daedric Smithing\\' perk, too. Useful for light armor characters. Read the description to find out why.",
  "descriptionHtml": "With this mod, you are able to set a skillpoint on \\'Daedric Smithing\\' after you learned to craft the \\'Dragon Armor\\' and you can set a skillpoint on \\'Ebony Smithing\\' after you get the \\'Daedric Smithing\\' perk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nI\\'m playing Skyrim with a thief/assasin and I prefer light armor, therefore I skill my character in all light armor smithing perks. The problem is that the strongest weapons are the daedric ones, but you have to skill your character in all heavy armor smithing perks to get daedric smithing. For every player who prefers light armor it would be a waste of skillpoints to achieve daedric smithing just for the stronger weapons. I think it\\'s a handicap for thieves/assasins charaters, because of that I made this mod. With this mod, you are able to set a skillpoint on \\'Daedric Smithing\\' after you learned to craft the \\'Dragon Armor\\'. There\\'s no change for heavy armor prefering players.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nThe new Dragonborn DLC allows you to craft Stahlrim weapons and armors. You need the \\'Ebony Smithing\\' perk to craft Stahlrim. There are light and heavy version of the Stahlrim armor. There\\'s a achievemet you get by crafting Stahlrim objects. The problem is, that it would be again a waste of skillpoints just to achieve the \\'Ebony Smithing\\' perk for players, who play with light armor, just for the achievement and some light Stahlrim armor. This mod fix this problem in a lore friendly and immersive way. You are able to set a skillpoint on \\'Ebony Smithing\\' after you learned to craft the \\'Daedric Smithing\\'.\r\n\r\n!DRAGONBORN IS NOT REQUIRED!\r\n\r\nWithout Dragonborn you won\\'t be able to craft Stahlrim objects, but you still can set a skillpoint on \\'Ebony Smithing\\' if you find a reason to do this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nJust activate the .esp file\r\n\r\n\r\nConflicts/Incompatibilities:\r\nThis mod could conflict with mods which change the perk trees and perk effects, especially with mods which change the Smithing-Skill-Perktree.",
