  "descriptionHtml": "history:\r\nI browsed the nexus many times but there weren\\'t any poison mods other than reweight mods. I waited for someone to create this simple enough mod too long, so i thought \\\"why not?\\\"\r\n\r\ndetails:\r\nI changed the \\\"concentrated poison\\\" perk and increased the amount of doses per bottle to 10. According to lore;  let\\'s say the dragonborn learns not to spill the whole bottle, apply the poison evenly on the weapon, etc.\r\nthis is intended to be used with mods like deadly dragons and on expert difficulty so it might be overpowered.\r\n\r\ninstallation:\r\nput the esp in your data folder and activate it.\r\n\r\nother:\r\nthere is no reason for this to bug your game.\r\nit may conflict with other mods that change the same perk.\r\nI will be glad if someone includes this to his/her own mod (with credit of course).\r\nany and all feedback is appreciated.",
