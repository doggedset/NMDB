  "descriptionHtml": "[heading]Mage Clothes[/heading]\r\n[i]If you like it - endorse it. Feedback appreciated. English and german version available![/i]\r\n\r\n[u][b]Description:[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nIn Vanilla Skyrim, there were only a small number of robes available, most of them blocking the head part too. In addition to give unarmored mages another disadvantage, it greatly restricts the variabilty in your outfit.\r\nNearly all of them were only available as enchanted versions.\r\n\r\nThis mod is a lore and vanilla friendly addition to the standard clothes and tries to address this problem. Therefore all \\\"common\\\" robes and hoods including Thalmor are now available as a chest-slot only version with the hood removed and included additionally.\r\n\r\nOutside the walls of Markath you will find a tailor shop which will sell the new stuff.\r\n\r\nThis mod neither changes the vanilla clothes nor it tries to balance things with exception of let you buy and war those variants chest and head seperately and in any combination you like.\r\n\r\nLook at the details for further information\r\n\r\n[u]Details:[/u]\r\n- Currently 14 non-hooded robes, 13 hoods, 8 boots and 5 gloves based on vanilla clothes added\r\n- Currently 0 additional color variants added\r\n- A new tailor shop outside of Markath which sells the new stuff\r\n\r\n[u][b]FAQ:[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nRequirements: None\r\nMod conflicts: Those who add/edith exterior cell MarkathExterior01. \r\nLanguages available: English, German\r\nClean: Yes.
