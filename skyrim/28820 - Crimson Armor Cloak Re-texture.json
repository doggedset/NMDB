  "descriptionHtml": "Hi all, this is my personal re-texture of Patobek\\'s Crimson armor cloak.\r\n\r\nIt is now made of leather/hide patches stitched together. I felt the original texture was too glossy and did not suit my ranger character like i personally wanted. So made this for myself. Figured i would post it up for anyone else that might like it. \r\n\r\n------------\r\nUPDATE\r\n------------\r\nI have added some pics showing the cloak with different armors, to show that with this texture the cloak still looks great.\r\n\r\nFor anyone wondering about what settings i use, i have 255 mods, so ALL of them lol. but my ENB is Stakado Cinemascope ENB - Near to zero performance loss http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15425 and old one that uses 1.08enb (which is included with the mod) but still has that film quality i so love. \r\n\r\n------------------\r\nREQUIRED\r\n------------------\r\nYOU WILL NEED to download -Crimson Armor - (and endorse it if you like it)\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25832\r\nThis is simply a texture file nothing more, it is useless without the original mod\r\n\r\nSimply place the cloak.dds file into your Skyrim data/textures/armor/archer folder. \r\nreplacing the existing file. Make a back up of the original if you wish to test first!\r\n\r\nI posted a message on the Crimson Armor mod page (and tried to PM Patobek, but he doesn\\'t take PM\\'s) About him adding this to his own mod as an alternate texture, but all is silent, so will go ahead and post it. If there is a problem, for whatever reason, with me posting this texture, please let me know and i will remove it at once. \r\n\r\nENJOY\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\nCREDITS\r\n-----------------\r\nThanks to Patobek for the awesome armor, thanks to my wife for the texture work :D\r\n\r\nAnd Thank You Nexus Legion!\r\nPaganlore",
