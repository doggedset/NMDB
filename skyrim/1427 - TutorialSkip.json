  "descriptionHtml": "\r\n I made the save file for personal use and thought I would share it as well, I am not sure if something like this has already been uploaded or not. The reason for this is to skip the first part of the game with introduction and tutorial. The character is level 1 with no perk points or skill increase spent. If you do not want to be the race I have chose simply tap the ~ key on your keyboard bringing up the console and type showracemenu with no spaces just as I have type it here and it will let you recreate your character without any negative side effects. \r\n\r\n Long story short , it lets me start over without the introduction and tutorial =)\r\n\r\nMany thanks for any endorsements but they are never required.\r\nConejito",
