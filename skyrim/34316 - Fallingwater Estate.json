  "descriptionHtml": "Fallingwater Estate is a Grand Player Lodge & Property located near Orotheim Cave. \r\n\r\nNo DLCs required; Enjoy! \r\n\r\nThis is just a little mod I put together in between my Fort Projects. \r\n(Go Check out Fort Winstad and Fort Heljarchen if you haven\\\\\\'t yet!) \r\n\r\nNot only do you get the best and most incredible view of Skyrim and the River, you also get: \r\n\r\n-A very cozy and very Custom dwelling for you to call home; complete with... \r\n+Grand Entrance/Foyer, with Several means of Displaying your finest wares found throughout Skyrim. \r\n+3 Bedrooms \r\n+Dining Hall & Kitchen \r\n+Pub \r\n+Housecarl to Patrol and Monitor your new, highly sought after Property. \r\n+Dynamic Interior Lighting that adjusts to the time of day. \r\n\r\n-Rooftop Patio with Access to Indoors via Second Floor \r\n\r\n-Outdoor Smithing Shop with Storage Chest and Supplies \r\n\r\n-Lookout Perch \r\n\r\n-Waterfall (if you place it juuust right, you can jump off and survive) \r\n\r\n-Exterior Lighting to find your way around in the Dark \r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs: \r\n\r\n-Mannequins might walk around.
