  "descriptionHtml": "This mod attempts to make Sheogorath look more like his Oblivion counterpart by restoring his eyes from the default blind ones to the unique catlike eyes from Shivering Isles.\r\n\r\nNote about lore:\r\nAlthough it is fitting with the comment made in Shivering Isles for the blind eyes,\r\n\\\"Wondering why I let him/her go, don\\'t you? I can see it in your face... mostly in your eyes. I may take those from you when all of this is over.\\\"\r\nthe skyrim image of Sheogorath was created using the Wabbajack, therefore the original appearance could be restored through its effects.",
