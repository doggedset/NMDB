  "descriptionHtml": "V1.2:\r<br />Alright first off i would like to thank everyone for the wonderful feedback i have received thus far in both my pm box and comments section. Now that being said I have taken much of what has been recommended into account and am currently working to fix many of the issues addressed. One of the largest problems i am working to fix is the large fps loss in the main city. However, i have been able to give the mod a significant update and have even unlocked access to he royal suite. Please feel free to download the update and make me aware of any continuing problems. I have also included several new photos. To download replace the old file with the new one.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks again.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Have been working on this one for some time now. Started it after being rather disapointed by the lack of dwarven architecture in the game. However, it is in its final stages and is structurally complete. Ul Strummok is a large Dwarven city, untouched by time, and the greatest haven for the ancient race. Includes a town, shops, and large castle. My plan is to have the remainder of the mod finished by the end of the month.\r<br />\r<br />Quest Preview (May release):\r<br />Travel to Ul Strummok and find the greatest treasure and undiscovered secrets of a once powerful race. Rumors stir of a Dwemer city untouched by the ages, cursed, and impenetrable from all mortal means. However if you can help solve the mystery of the Eternal Mountain all its secrets and powers can be yours. (includes new weapons, player houses, functioning city, and new armor) \r<br />  \r<br />Does not Require DLC\r<br />if there are any problems or if you have any suggestions feel free to message me or post a comment.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks for your support and enjoy the city.
