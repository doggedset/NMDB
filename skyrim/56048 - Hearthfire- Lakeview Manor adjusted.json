  "modName": "Hearthfire- Lakeview Manor adjusted",
  "summary": "Edited the front flora and replaced the necromancer alter with something more hearthful. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Updates at the bottom\r<br />-------\r<br />\r<br />[b]What this does[/b]\r<br />This removes the tree to the right of the Lakeview Manor, and replaces it with some other plants, and a stump to make it look like it was cut down. It also adds a bit on the left side of the doorway. \r<br />\r<br />I replaced the necromancer alter with something a little more warming. There is a dock and a boat on the lake, and I edited the plants surrounding it slightly. \r<br />\r<br />There is a tree in front of the workbench I placed, because I don&#39;t honestly remember if one was there or not, and it felt pretty empty. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation[/b]\r<br />I tested it out and you can just install via the nmm or manually. I don&#39;t know how to make it really ready for the nmm like a lot of mods, so if anyone knows that would be greatly appreciated. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Requirements[/b]\r<br />Well, you could try running this without Hearthfire, but I don&#39;t think you would get very far.\r<br />If there is a mod that edits the same things as I did, then it wouldn&#39;t work together; probably. \r<br />\r<br />If there are any problems with the mod itself though, let me know&#33; This is my first time so there are bound to be some issues. Therefore,[i]please be sure to make a backup just in case[/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Updates:[/b]\r<br />[b]1.2[/b] - Added a cellar door so one can access their basement from the outside more quickly.\r<br />On the main file, the horn on the barrel behind the ladder is moved, because I was trying to move all the objects around the ladder, but after loading in they would revert back to their original place, save for that. \r<br />[b]1.2[/b] - The objects on the shelf behind the ladder are marked so they won&#39;t respawn. I thought about deleting the hook, might do it later. \r<br />[b]1.1[/b] - I took out the bat file and the items chest. One for more testing and things I want to add, as well as I want to put it as it&#39;s own file. I have plans for a house too...it is still in the old version if you want it though. \r<br />[b]1.1[/b] - moved tree near the crafting bench. ",
