  "descriptionHtml": "This is busty versions of the new armor that came with Dawnguard.  Heavy Falmer, and Ivory more specifically.  Based around the proportions of CBBE.  Basically to fill the void until Caliente or someone else can make a proper version of the Dawnguard armors.  Will probably fit any busty body type.  Since there is little skin showing it doesn\\'t really matter.  Designed mainly to match my GRRL body type.\r\n\r\nWill try to get Dawnguard armor, and the various Vampire clothes, robes and armors added in a day or two.\r\n\r\nAnyone can do what ever you want with these.  No content was added, I only changed the shape of the vanilla mesh.",
