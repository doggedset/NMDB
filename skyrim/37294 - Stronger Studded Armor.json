  "summary": "Edited studded armor so that it is equal to Elven in quality",
  "descriptionHtml": "A very simple tweak. It bothered me how studded armor was only marginally better than hide, and even with the metallic shoulder plate and other reinforcements it was worse than leather. This minor tweak changes the armor value of studded armor so that it is on par with Elven armor. While this gives you a substantially stronger body armor in the beginning of the game, you still cannot get a matching set bonus with it, so switching to Elven later is still a good idea.",
