  "descriptionHtml": "Just a small script change that should make it so that players that transform into wolves should transform back to their characters even if they are vampires. --- Needs willing testers --- will expand if popular\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is possible to become both a vampire and a werewolf. After becoming a werewolf use the command player.removespell f5ba0 to remove the Resist Disease effect caused by lycanthropy.\r\n\r\n\r\nplayer.addspell 000b8780 adds vampirism but you may have to do it a few times. also the first time you turn into a werewolf is hard coded and will set you back to your original race if you give yourself vampirism after the first time you turn then you will be fine.",
