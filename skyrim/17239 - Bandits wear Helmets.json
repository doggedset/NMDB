  "descriptionHtml": "I discovered when playing around with the Creation Kit that there\\'s a levelled list for bandit helmets, but it\\'s never used. The bandit outfit doesn\\'t contain the list, so the only NPCs that use the list are two random trappers who aren\\'t even bandits at all!\r\n\r\nWith this mod, I\\'ve added the list to the melee bandit outfits, so bandits can now properly spawn with a 50% chance of wearing a helmet.",
