Note that I don&#39;t have ANY mods installed, so I really don&#39;t know wich ones are compatible or not.\r<br />\r<br />Mods that shouldn&#39;t cause problems\r<br />----------------------------------\r<br />-Adding or changing UI\r<br />-Adding or changing locations\r<br />-Adding or changing textures\r<br />-Adding dialogues\r<br />-Adding quests\r<br />-Adding spells\r<br />-Adding all kinds of stuff\r<br />\r<br />Mods that might cause problems\r<br />------------------------------\r<br />-Changing quests (for example companion specific)\r<br />-Changing actors (specially the lvl ones)\r<br />-Changing spells\r<br />-Changing meshes\r<br />-Changing names of objects\r<br />-Changing statics, misc or any other object in general\r<br />\r<br />In sum, adding should not cause any compatibility issue, but changing might, so pay attention to changes. Not all types of changes are &#34;bad&#34;, but adding is better than changing, changing stuff causes massive compatibility and stability problems.\r<br />\r<br />Known problematic mods\r<br />----------------------\r<br />-UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul (causes CTD because it changes vanilla companion stuff)\r<br />-Dawnguard Vampire Lord reverse Transforming Face fix - Vanilla (if you are a Vampire Lord you will CTD when using the EarthquakeShout)\r<br />\r<br />Load order\r<br />----------\r<br />Since this mod doesn&#39;t change anything vanilla I advise to load it first then other mods.\r<br />\r<br />~TITLE~\r<br />======\r<br />BlackLand - A new (is)land to explore&#33;\r<br />\r<br />~SMALL DESCRIPTION~\r<br />===================\r<br />V1.6\r<br />\r<br />-10 to 20+ hours of new gameplay\r<br />-New (is)land\r<br />-New village\r<br />-New dungeons\r<br />-New quests\r<br />-New NPC&#39;s\r<br />-New spells\r<br />-Mini games\r<br />-Survival modes\r<br />-Secrets/Easter eggs\r<br />\r<br />~LONG DESCRIPTION~\r<br />==================\r<br />Adds a new island called BlackLand with a new village, you will meet new NPC&#39;s that need your help to solve some of their problems. \r<br />\r<br />You will find new unique dungeons in your adventures presenting new challenges.\r<br />\r<br />New powerful unique spells and powers to use and discover. \r<br />\r<br />Mini games with replay value to entertain you when you aren&#39;t exploring (if needed, see spoilers below). \r<br />\r<br />Survival modes for the brave\r<br />----------------------------\r<br />-Destructible weapon: Your weapon will degrade with use\r<br />-Destructible armor (slow scrit): Your armor will degrade with use\r<br />-Destructible shield: Your shield will degrade with use\r<br />-Sleepy: Sleep depravation will cause bad effects\r<br />-Starving: Food depravation will cause bad effects\r<br />\r<br />Hidden secrets/easter eggs to enrich your exploration (if needed, see spoilers below).\r<br />\r<br />~INSTALLATION~\r<br />==============\r<br />Should be simple, use Nexus Mod Manager, or...\r<br />\r<br />-First unzip\r<br />-Open the folder and copy the contents to your Skyrim Data folder (BlackLand.bsa and BlackLand.esp)\r<br />-Normally: C:Program Files (x86)SteamsteamappscommonskyrimData\r<br />-Start the game, choose DATA FILES, check BlackLand\r<br />-Done&#33;\r<br />\r<br />If you enter an interior and you appear in &#34;space&#34; you might need to:\r<br />-Go to C:My DocumentsMy GamesSkyrim\r<br />-Search for file Skyrim.ini \r<br />-Open with notepad, under [General] add iLargeIntRefCount=999999\r<br />\r<br />If you don&#39;t have grass please check this link: http://goo.gl/aZdhRa\r<br />\r<br />If you have shout problems it seems installing the mod with NMM shrinks the size of your BlackLand.bsa, please check to see if it&#39;s +- 400 mb, if it&#39;s smaller than that ( &lt; 200 mb) you should uninstall the mod with NMM and install it manually.\r<br />\r<br />~TES5EDIT~\r<br />==========\r<br />When cleaning you may encounter a lot of items (825 last time I checked), this is what the creator of TES5Edit had to say about them:\r<br />\r<br />&#34;That&#39;s some special case handling for removing cells which were defined but are not actually used for anything. If you go to those forms manually you&#39;ll note that they&#39;re likely just cell records with nothing attached, or cell records with empty &#34;Temporary&#34; blocks on them.\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s harmless to let it remove those, though it&#39;ll probably get annoying since the CK will insist on resaving them - unlike the behavior in Oblivion.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />So, no point removing them.\r<br />\r<br />~PERFORMANCE~\r<br />=============\r<br />If you have performance issues and are using destructible survival modes, try to deactivate them, the slowest script is the destructible armor, start by it then deactivate the others if needed.\r<br />\r<br />~MOTIVATION~\r<br />============\r<br />I love games, I love playing them and I love &#34;making&#34; them, this mod is an opportunity to show my skills and at the same time &#34;work&#34; in the industry, and maybe, who knows, work for real in this area?\r<br />\r<br />Prior to this mod I only modded PES - Pro Evolution Soccer, I had no clue how to script or use CK, it has been a long road with lots of bumps, and I mean lots, but I&#39;ve enjoyed all hours (3500+ CK, 390+ Skyrim) that I&#39;ve spent editing this game (almost all of them anyways).\r<br />\r<br />I hope you can enjoy it too :)\r<br />\r<br />~THANKS~\r<br />========\r<br />Thanks to my wife for understanding me, I love you.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Keld, your beta testing is awesome&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to the guys at http://forums.bethsoft.com/forum/184-the-creation-kit/ they are amazing&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to all VAs (Voice Actors), your work makes this mod better.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to the guys at Steam chat group Skyrim Creation Kit, my first helpers.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for providing such a great game and tools, thanks to all that read this and thanks to the ones that enjoy the mod.\r<br />\r<br />~CREDITS~\r<br />=========\r<br />By Black aka Black RL aka BlackRL\r<br />\r<br />TESTER\r<br />------\r<br />Keld aka KeldRL aka Keld RL\r<br />\r<br />VOICE ACTING\r<br />------------\r<br />Voice Actor: Aranas\r<br />NPC(s): Mannimarco, Golem\r<br />Site: www.tesalliance.org\r<br />\r<br />Voice Actor: Black RL\r<br />NPC(s): Vajezatha\r<br />Site: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38635\r<br />\r<br />Voice Actor: bmw4acting\r<br />NPC(s): Leah, Maria\r<br />Site: www.forums.nexusmods.com\r<br />\r<br />Voice Actor: DylanBrettMa\r<br />NPC(s): Lazarus\r<br />Site: www.forums.nexusmods.com\r<br />\r<br />Voice Actor: Edouard\r<br />NPC(s): Jose, Mukrah, Skeleton King, King Kyros, Player (EarthQuake Shout)\r<br />Site: www.tesalliance.org\r<br />\r<br />Voice Actor: jackattack91   \r<br />NPC(s): Jack, Patrobas, bandits\r<br />Site: www.forums.nexusmods.com\r<br />\r<br />Voice Actor: Jazzy Long   \r<br />NPC(s): Tarea\r<br />Site: www.steamcommunity.com\r<br />\r<br />Voice Actor: JudeRodney   \r<br />NPC(s): Aplestormy\r<br />Site: www.tesalliance.org\r<br />\r<br />Voice Actor: Kan\r<br />NPC(s): Valkiria, Andreia, Sarah, Bandit, Vampire, Laish, Ur, Player (EarthQuake Shout)\r<br />Site: www.steamcommunity.com\r<br />\r<br />Voice Actor: Kittygineer Belle\r<br />NPC(s): Albina, Raca, Leonor\r<br />Site: www.steamcommunity.com\r<br />\r<br />Voice Actor: madonecfn\r<br />NPC(s): Sadoc, Kro, Obal, Daniel\r<br />Site: www.steamcommunity.com\r<br />\r<br />Voice Actor: Nextmastermind\r<br />NPC(s): Judas\r<br />Site: www.tesalliance.org\r<br />\r<br />Voice Actor: Styrophone  \r<br />NPC(s): Racer\r<br />Site: www.tesalliance.org\r<br />\r<br />Voice Actor: thera_ca\r<br />NPC(s): Abda\r<br />Site: www.steamcommunity.com\r<br />\r<br />Voice Actor: XenocideSoldier \r<br />NPC(s): Black, Keld\r<br />Site: www.tesalliance.org\r<br />\r<br />Voice Actor: xybrisva\r<br />NPC(s): Julius\r<br />Site: www.tesalliance.org\r<br />\r<br />Voice Actor: Y A R&#33;\r<br />NPC(s): Nadab, Solid, Candido\r<br />Site: www.steamcommunity.com\r<br />\r<br />IMAGES\r<br />------\r<br />Dragon priest by blenderisedmind\r<br />\r<br />MODS\r<br />----\r<br />Oblivion Gates in Skyrim - Modders Resource by Hanaisse\r<br />\r<br />SITES\r<br />-----\r<br />http://www.bethsoft.com\r<br />http://www.elderscrolls.com/skyrim\r<br />http://www.creationkit.com\r<br />http://www.uesp.net\r<br />http://elderscrolls.wikia.com\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com\r<br />http://en.wikipedia.org\r<br />http://steamcommunity.com/workshop\r<br />http://www.tesalliance.org\r<br />http://www.moddb.com\r<br />\r<br />~SPOILERS~\r<br />==========\r<br />Golem Armor (power)\r<br />-------------------\r<br />-Complete The Old Stone Giants and Brothers To The End quests\r<br />-Go to the village garden\r<br />-Sit in front of the Golem for 180 seconds when not in combat\r<br />\r<br />Sun and Eclipse (spells)\r<br />------------------------\r<br />-Go to the highest place in the map (mountain near the golems)\r<br />-It can&#39;t be rainning\r<br />-Hour must be &gt;7am and &lt;5pm\r<br />-Go to the top, you will see a new NPC\r<br />-Look at the sun long enough so he talks to you\r<br />\r<br />Inferno staff (MISSABLE&#33;)\r<br />-------------------------\r<br />-Location: Oblivion\r<br />-In the top of the mountain, before the stairs, there&#39;s a small &#34;arena&#34;
