  "descriptionHtml": "MrGrimm73\\'s Breezehome Enchanting Table\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nThis is a super simple mod that adds a WORKING miniature enchanting table to the GUEST \r\nbedroom of Breeze Home in Whiterun. NO, this does not give you breeze home...you still  \r\nhave to purchase it like the rest of us. But, the table will be there upon purchase...I  \r\nthink lol\r\n\r\nI have mine totally furnished [breezehome], so if you do not, then there should be like \r\na crate and some hay to the left...EITHER way, the miniature enchanting table should be \r\non the dresser to the right as soon as you walk in the guest bedroom.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nINSTALL:\r\n\r\nUnzip the file. Put the \\\"Data\\\" folder in your root Skyrim directory (Where TESV.exe  \r\nresides). If asked to merge the Data folder with Data folder say yes. This is  \r\nreally basic stuff. In Fact if you want, just drag the .esp to where it belongs. \r\n\r\nIf you can\\'t figure out how to install this file or follow the directions on how to, you  \r\nshould not be here anyways lol :P\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\n\r\nDelete the file...duh...\r\n\r\n\r\nlol\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRandom:\r\n\r\nIf you looked at all the screen shots and asked yourself, \\\"What is that super awesome  \r\noutfit?!?!?!?!?!\\\", Here is the link to it:\r\n\r\nFIRST you must install the base file here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18008\r\n\r\nTHEN the re-tex version here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23626\r\n\r\nsince the outfit made it into a screen shot or two, I figured I’d plug the outfit since I  \r\nreally really like it.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nISSUE:\r\nONE small weird thing, since it is lower and smaller than usual enchanting tables, when  \r\nyour character leans over it there is a gap between their hands and the table. IF I feel  \r\nlike fixing it I will, but don’t hold your breath...then again, it kind of bothers me...idk...\r\nmaybe I will fix it... If YOU would like to fix it and re-upload it, feel free to do so. All I ask is you give credit where it is due. I made this mod for myself and only uploaded it because I am positive there\\'s at least 1 other skyrim playing human being in the world that wants an enchanting table in their Whiterun house.\r\n\r\n\r\n...unless there\\'s not...then ... uh... tomatoes.",
