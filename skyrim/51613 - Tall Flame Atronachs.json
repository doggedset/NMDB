  "summary": "Simply makes flame atronachs a bit taller, somewhat taller than an altmer though shorter than a frost atronach, it&#39;s still a small enough change that it probably won&#39;t cause navmeshing issues or anything.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This simply makes flame atronachs taller by editing their height in the race settings, taller than an altmer but shorter than a frost atronach. The mod file size is very small only 1.58 KB as it&#39;s an extremely simple mod that only changes that one thing. I made this in part because I think I remembered flame atronachs being taller in Morrowind before the Devs decided to shrink them a bit in the next games (if I remember right), and I think it makes flame atronachs look much more powerful this way, regardless whatever the case I wanted flame atronachs to be a little bit bigger than they are in vanilla, and perhaps some other people feel the same so I made this mod.\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s still a small enough change that it almost certainly won&#39;t cause navmesh or collision problems.",
