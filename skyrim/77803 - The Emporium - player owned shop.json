  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b][size=4]The Emporium - BETA[/size][/b][/center]\r<br />[center][/center][center][/center]\r<br />This mod is heavily inspired by a similar mod for Oblivion that allowed the player to own a shop. I started making in for my own use, but lost interest over time. I&#39;m finally publishing it here in case someone else finds it useful, while I plan to work some more on it in the near future.\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s by no means a finished product - currently, this allows you to purchase a fully decorated and staffed shop in Riften, sell items, view stock ledgers and view items sold. To facilitate merchant/crafting RP, you can also order random raw crafting materials and there is a back room with all the crafting stations. There&#39;s also a hidden trapdoor that contains your goods vault. \r<br />[center][b][size=4]\r<br />Requirements[/size][/b][/center]\r<br />[center]\r<br />SKSE, All Expansions[/center][center][b][size=4]\r<br />FAQ[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b]What is this?[/b]\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a player-owned shop in Riften, accessible from The Ragged Flaggon.\r<br />\r<br />[b]How do I get the shop?[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Speak to Vekel, he will sell you the deed for 5000 gold.\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=2]Why does the shop decor not match The Ragged Flaggon?[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Originally the shop was in Solitude, but I moved it once I started playing a shady character who wanted more of a black market operation. I might redecorate in the future.\r<br />\r<br />[b]How do I run the shop?[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Talk to your business manager, he&#39;ll give you a short guidebook. At the back, put items you want to sell in the sell chest. At your desk, find the &#39;Open/Close Shop&#39; ledger to start/stop selling. Once every 24 hours, some items will be sold (based on your Speech skill) and gold deposited in the profits chest. \r<br />[b][size=2]\r<br />[/size][/b][b][size=2]How do I check my stocks?\r<br />[/size][/b]\r<br />There&#39;s a ledger summarising total stock value at current Speechcraft skill and another one with total goods sold. \r<br />\r<br />[b]How do I order crafting materials?[/b]\r<br />\r<br />For 1000 gold you can order random crafting materials using the ledger near your desk. These will be deposited in the crafting room.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]Known Issues[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Value of enchanted items is not properly calculated by getGoldValue, so enchanted items sell for less than their worth. \r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]Credits[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />Various modder resources on Nexus (if I missed someone, let me know):\r<br />\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Modder&#39;s resource pack: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16525/?\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Open Books resource: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14134/?\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Paintings and frames: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17423/?\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients wall art: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30602/?\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Elianora&#39;s extra resources: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53192/?\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;witcher resources: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68755/?\r<br />[/center]",
