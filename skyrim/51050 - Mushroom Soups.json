I organized the mushrooms by color - lame, I know - and made some recipes for edible soups with additional magic effects, based on the ingredients used. Here are the recipes:\r<br />\r<br />[i]- Bitter Mushroom Soup: Resist Magic (Imp Stool x 2 + Bleeding Crown + Salt Pile)\r<br />- Chunky Mushroom Soup: Regen Stamina (Scaly Pholiota + Mora Tapinella + Namira&#39;s Rot + Salt Pile)\r<br />- Creamy Mushroom Soup: Resist Shock (White Cap + Swamp Fungal Pod x2 + Salt Pile)\r<br />- Red Mushroom Soup: Resist Fire (Fly Amanita +  Blisterwort + Salt Pile)\r<br />- Sloppy Mushroom Soup: Restore Magicka (Glowing Mushroom x2 + Giant Lichen + Salt Pile)[/i]\r<br />\r<br />The new consumables are compatible out-of-the-box with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60270/?]RND - Universal Compatibility Patch[/url]. [i][b]I will not make a dedicated patch for it or any other needs mods.[/b][/i] If you want to make one, feel free to do so.
