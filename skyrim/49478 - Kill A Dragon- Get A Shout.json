  "modName": "Kill A Dragon- Get A Shout",
  "summary": "This mod gives you a chance to learn and unlock a new shout that you don&#39;t already know any time you kill a dragon.",
  "descriptionHtml": "If you&#39;re like me, you loathe starting a new Skyrim save file because that means you have none of the shouts unlocked anymore. It&#39;s not worth spending hours running through caves and the storyline trying to unlock them all on every new character you play. Using the console command to just add all the shouts and souls necessary is not as fun and can easily overthrow the balance of the game, if you care about such things. With that in mind, I decided to try to create a mod that would solve this problem in a natural and organic way that flows with gameplay.\r<br />\r<br />What the mod does:\r<br />\r<br />With this mod there is, for the time being, a 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100% chance (depending on which .esp you choose) to unlock a new word of a shout whenever you kill a dragon. This includes words for shouts that you do not know yet. For example:Even if you have not learned any part of the Flame Breath shout, you still have a chance to unlock the first word of it.\r<br />\r<br />You will randomly learn the next word of one of these 15 shouts:\r<br />Animal Allegiance\r<br />Aura Whisper\r<br />Become Ethereal\r<br />Disarm\r<br />Dismay\r<br />Elemental Fury\r<br />Fire Breath\r<br />Frost Breath\r<br />Ice Form\r<br />Kynes Peace\r<br />Marked For Death\r<br />Slow Time\r<br />Storm Call\r<br />Throw Voice\r<br />Whirlwind Sprint\r<br />\r<br />Certain shouts like dragonrend and unrelenting force were left out because they are tied in with quests and I did not want to screw anything up by giving those out before you are meant to get them. \r<br />\r<br />Shouts from DLC are not available because this is my first mod and I wanted to minimize possible issues. It seems compatible with the DLC though.\r<br />\r<br />Future Plans:\r<br />In later versions I hope to add a way in game to change the likelihood of learning a new shout, rather than needing to switch between .esp files, so that everyone can choose to use this mod however they want.\r<br />\r<br />I also plan to make versions that allow you to learn shouts that are from DLC.\r<br />\r<br />Notes:\r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod ever, meaning I am very new to this. I do not know if this is compatible with other mods at all. I only added a single script to what appears to be the main dragon creature, so I assume that there should be little if any trouble at all. I do not know if this will allow all dragons to give out shouts, but in my testing it seemed to work out this way.\r<br />If there are any problems at all, please let me know as soon as possible.\r<br />\r<br />If anyone has any suggestions about the mod, leave a comment.",
