  "summary": "In Skyrim you somewhat need a weapon that can do some range damage. Especially when it comes to Dragons. The Bound Bow was one of the most useful spells out there for this, but the requirements are kind of high for those that don\\'t focus on mainly magicka and conjuration it becomes difficult to use the bow. This mod changes that",

The Bound Bow was one of the most useful spells out there for this, but the requirements are kind of high for those that don\\'t focus on mainly magicka and conjuration it becomes difficult to use the bow. This mod changes that\r\n\r\nI have reduced the required magicka of the spell to 25 points. It still has all the same stats, and will benefit from the mystic binding perk as well. I have also set the skill requirement to Novice, so you should not require anything to be able to use the skill but it will help level your Conjuration. \r\n\r\nHow to get Create Bow:\r\nI\\'ve named the Spell Tome Create Bow to differentiate it from the original Bound Bow spell. Go to the Forge and look under the \\\"MISC\\\" category, you should see the tome Called \\\"Spell Tome: Create Bow\\\". It requires one leather strip to craft. \r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nCopy and paste the CreateBow.esp file into your Skyrim/Data folder.\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\nDelete the CreateBow.esp from your Skyrim/Data folder. \r\n\r\nOther mods:\r\nEbony Blade Fixed - Enchantable and Upgradable\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17773/",
