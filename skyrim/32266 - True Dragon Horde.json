  "descriptionHtml": "PLEASE WATCH THE VIDEO!\r\n\r\nI made this mod after the Skeleton Dragon Companion Mod, it works pretty much in the same way, simply fast travel and you get your very own Dragon Horde!\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n\r\nSimply Download The Dragon Horde File Folder And Copy And Paste Their Esp File To The Skyrim Data File Folder Under Your C: Drive In Your Steam Folder And You Are Good To Go!\r\n\r\nComputer Install = C:/Steam/Steam Apps/Skyrim/Common/Data\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThere are 5 separate Dragons to choose from, you can have one of each or all five it is up to you! They all have voices corresponding to where they come from as well. Also I made them separate files so you can mod them and make your own horde, so your welcome! Also they will speak in battle, very cool.\r\n\r\nSpecial Notes:\r\nYou need multiples of the ESP files to have multiple Dragons, this mod works on copy and paste, also I did it this way because Skyrim has a limit on how many companions you can have in game, so the copy and paste is a work around. So in short 5 ESP Files = 5 Dragons, like you see in the photo above!\r\n\r\nDragons:\r\nCrimsonhellkite The Bane: is based of the Boss Dragon Design\r\nHelm of the Black Mist: Demon Style Dragon\r\nMoldean of the Forest: Forest Style Dragon\r\nDread Bitten of the Frost: Frost or Snow Style Dragon\r\nRayne of the Wind: Female Wind Style Dragon\r\n\r\nIssues: None, I have 10 of these dragons right now in my game with a dozen extra mods installed, so if it works for me it must work for you!\r\n\r\nThanks and have fun with it!\r\n",
