  "summary": "This is a mod that aims to make greybeard robes playable (will make available to you at a later time WITHOUT console commands) and giant clubs drop from giants and be usable by the player. I&#39;ll probably add more items later&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "ok, time to release my first mod&#33;\r<br />it is also available on steam workshop for those of who don&#39;t use the nexus for whatever reason.\r<br />so, this mod allows for greybeard robes to be looted off of dead greybeards&#39; bodies (you must set them to be nonessential in console first&#33;)\r<br />and giant clubs to drop from giants.\r<br />I have searched the nexus and both of these have already been done, if not better than this.\r<br />However, combining the two edits into one mod was my idea, and I didn&#39;t go through anybody&#39;s code to do ANY of it.\r<br />\r<br />compatibility: works with almost every mod out there that doesn&#39;t edit the greybeard robes or the giant clubs. this means it works with unofficial patches, flora overhauls, better vampires, and nude greybeard mods (that will just make this a bit pointless&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />dlc: none REQUIRED, but I recommend buying them if you don&#39;t have them already.\r<br />\r<br />skyrim version: I believe everybody should be on 1.9.32.08. if not, please update and then run the game with this installedÂ  before posting bug reports. I can&#39;t help you if you don&#39;t use the latest version.\r<br />\r<br />languages: well, this SHOULD work with whatever language, so long as my renaming of an item to &#34;fork&#34; and another to &#34;knife&#34; doesn&#39;t bother you too much (optional file only). I&#39;ll make translations if you MUST have this mod.\r<br />\r<br />if you don&#39;t know how to make a greybeard unessential and then kill him, here&#39;s an easy way\r<br />1.) type in the console: help wulfgar 4\r<br />2.) find the id for the npc it has and type in console: player.placeatme &lt;wulfgar&gt;\r<br />don&#39;t ACTUALLY type in &lt;wulfgar&gt;, but rather look for the id that&#39;s in there and type that in, instead.\r<br />then, type this in console: setessential &lt;wulfgar&gt; 0\r<br />again, that&#39;s where wulfgar&#39;s id was, not wulfgar himself.\r<br />then, click the wulfgar you spawned and type: kill\r<br />if you did it correctly, wulfgar should be dead and you can loot his body. the robes will be in there, too.\r<br />if you want the head bandage (i made that playable, too&#33;) then just do this to the other 3 greybeards and see which one(s) have them.\r<br />\r<br />new&#33; clutter thingie optional mod:\r<br />I ended up adding a new feature to this&#33; as an optional file, you get the main mod with forks and knives that normally can&#39;t be used as usable forks and knives&#33; so please only install one of the mods from the list.",
