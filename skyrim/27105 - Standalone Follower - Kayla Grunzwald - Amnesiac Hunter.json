  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6]\r\nATTN: This file, and my other standalone follower mods have been discontinued in favor of a page that hosts all of them as one mod, along with updates/new followers/etc.\r\n\r\nThat mod page can be found here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38042//?\r\n[/size]\r\n\r\n[Heading][B]Name: Kayla Grunzwald\r\n\r\nRace: Nord Female\r\n\r\nEye Color: Blue\r\n\r\nLocation: The Drunken Huntsman[/Heading]\r\n\r\n\r\n[COLOR=Red]Download Instructions:[/COLOR]\r\nThrough Nexus Mod Manager (Recommended)\r\n1.

That being said, if they seem broken/OP early on, or on low difficulties, that\\'s why.\r\n\r\nAs always, my follower\\'s are completely standalone, unless stated otherwise. I put a lot of work into their backgrounds, so I hope you take the time to read them :3\r\n\r\nI\\'ve recently made the switch to Amazing Follower Tweaks (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15524) upon updating my game, and I haven\\'t looked back. I highly recommend trying it out alongside my followers. Remember to place the followers below AFT on the load order.\r\n\r\nPlease, leave comments, and endorse if you enjoy playing with my mods!\r\n\r\nIf there are any bugs or glitches, let me know and I\\'ll gladly fix them ASAP to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\n[COLOR=Red]Changelog:[/COLOR]\r\nVersion 1: Initial Release\r\n\r\nVersion 2: Armor Change\r\n\r\nVersion 3: Realized the method I used had perks stacking up way too high, so, fixed that/Changed Morality to Allow Any Crime.\r\n\r\n[Color=Red]Background:[/Color]\r\n\r\nSometimes, the hardest part of moving forward, is understanding what\\'s behind you.\r\n\r\n\\\"Everything before a couple of years ago is a blur. I don\\'t remember my parents, my friends, my home... The last memory I have of elsewhere was a deafening screech, I was terrified, but I\\'m not sure of what. After that, well... I was here.\\\"\r\n\r\nKayla currently works in the Drunken Huntsman as a cook and fellow hunter and friend of Elrindir and Anoriath. After the \\\"incident\\\", she was found by the brothers during a hunting expedition, and taken in. There, she learned the ways of the hunter in order to pay back her debts to the brothers, who quickly befriended the amnesiac. During her first expedition with the brother\\'s, she fells a large bear with a single arrow. The skin of that bear furnished the leather of her armor.\r\n\r\nExtremely polite and always cheerful, one wouldn\\'t believe that she is haunted by nightmares most nights. They\\'re always the same; A village on fire, the screams of a woman and children, a deafening screech, and then black...\r\n\r\nAs a hunter, Kayla has heard the cries of many animals. However, none match the roar in her dreams. Upon meeting the Dragonborn, she decides to travel with him in search of the source of her nightmare.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Color=Red]Description:[/Color]\r\n\r\nKayla is a joyful hunter of Whiterun. Despite her lack of formal training in melee weaponry, her background of hunting, and her Nord heritage lends her strength in close quarters. However, she still prefers a quick arrow to her target\\'s neck.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Color=Red]Perk List:[/COLOR]\r\n\r\nArchery: Overdraw (2), Critical Shot (3), Eagle Eye, Power Shot, Ranger, Quick Shot\r\n\r\nSneak: Stealth (3), Muffled Movement, Light Foot, Silent Roll, Deadly Aim, Silence.\r\n\r\nLight Armor: Custom Fit, Unhindered\r\n\r\nOne Handed: Armsman (1), Fighting Stance, Hack and Slash (1), Critical Charge\r\n\r\n\r\n[COLOR=Red](Hopefully) To Come:[/COLOR]\r\n\r\nFully Scripted Follower Quests\r\n\r\nFully Voiced Followers\r\n\r\n\r\n[Color=Red]Resources:[/Color]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666]CBBE NevNud Body Meshes and Textures[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9915]MissAniThrope and chakaru11\\'s C Eyes (eyeblue) Texture[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12951]Enhanced Character Edit Headmesh[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14569]Univision Face Textures[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]Apachii Skyhair Female Hair #4 Meshes and Textures[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27073]Ran\\'s FFT Archer Armor[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6554]Navetsea\\'s CBBE Textures[/url]\r\n[/B]",
