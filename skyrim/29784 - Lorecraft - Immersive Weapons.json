It uses and needs both Immersive weapons and Lorecraft.\r\n\r\nWhat this plug in actually does is; \r\n\r\n*Distributes 180+ weapons added by the Immersive Weapons mod to several (20+) book of crafting recipes\r\n\r\n*Removes the recipes of the weapons that are contained in a book from the crafting table list\r\n\r\n*These books can be bought from vendors, looted from enemies and traded from the Arcane Smith at the Skyforge in exchange for Dragonsouls (rare and special books only)\r\n\r\n*These books are used to add corresponding recipes to your crafting table list. They can also be turned on and off at will. Which will help you keep your crafting table clutter free.\r\n\r\n[i]Refer to Lorecraft mod main page for more detailed info.[/i]\r\n\r\nAll the credits for this should go to ArcaneSmith author of Lorecraft and hothtrooper44 & Ironman5000 for the great compilation of Immersive Weapons as well as all the modders, modelers and coders who have contributed to it\\'s content.\r\n\r\nThis plug-in is also in beta state, and as such some weapons added by the Immersive weapons mod may still not have books or the books grouping and/or drop rates may not be ideal.\r\nComments, ideas for book names, texts or groupings and bug reports are appreciated.\r\n\r\n[color=green][b]Version Notes[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[i]v1.2b[/i]\r\nAdded support for Immersive weapons v1.3\r\n\r\nAdded new books for the new weapons coming with Immersive Weapons 1.3\r\n\r\nAdded description to all books which will give you an idea what\\'s inside the book before taking or reading\r\n\r\n[i]v1.1b[/i]\r\nThis is for the [i]Immersive Weapons v1.2[/i] but it will work with newer versions too. Only problems will be:\r\n*Newly added weapons won\\'t have books and will directly appear in crafting menus\r\n*Any old crafting recipes updated may be negated by the plug-in\r\n\r\n[color=red][b]PREREQUISITES[/b][/color]\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9959]LORECRAFT by Arcane smith[/url]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27644]IMMERSIVE WEAPONS by hothtrooper44[/url]\r\n\r\n[b]INSTALLATION[/b]\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n[i]Automatic Install[/i]\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nAutomatic installation by either Nexus Mod Manager \r\nor Mod Organizer (recommended) is almost mandatory these days.\r\nDOWNLOAD EITHER OF THEM ON NEXUS NOW*\r\n\r\n\r\n- Download Lorecraft from Nexus\r\n- Download Immersive Weapons From Nexus\r\n- Activate LorecraftESM.esm (if not already activated)\r\n- Make sure Lorecraft - Immersive Weapons.esp comes after Immersive Weapons.esp in the load order.\r\n\r\n\r\n***Don\\'t rename any files*** \r\n*** Let the Database finish updating before playing ***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n============================================================================================\r\n     [b]TESTING HALL AND TEST CONTAINER[/b] (for Lorecraft itself)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLorecraft\\'s Testing Hall can be accessed by entering coc loreTest on the console. \r\nIt\\'s useful for modders testing their books or choosing template books, or for users\r\nthat want to cheat, test the mod\\'s features or do some troubleshooting. \r\n\r\nIt features a test container that accesses Lorecraft books, bookshelves for managing \r\ntesting and crafting stations.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Test Container Options:[/b]\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n[b]DATABASE[/b]\r\n\r\nCopies books from the DATABSE into the container\r\nThe DATABASE is a list of books that haven\\'t been acquired yet, in other words, \r\nthat will still drop from enemies or sold by merchants or rewarded in any other way.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]LIBRARY[/b]\r\n\r\nCopies books from the LIBRARY into the container\r\nThe LIBRARY lists all books you have acquired, including non-Lorecraft books.

Inform the plugin\\'s author about it.\r\n\t- If it\\'s happening to random books across many plugins, contact ME about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nBook pages show a rainbow colored \\\"img:\\\" image.\r\n\t\r\n\t- Missing image. Inform the author of the plugin which books are missing images.\r\n\r\n\r\nItem doesn\\'t show at forge when I read the book\r\n\r\n\t- Make sure it\\'s not crafted at the tanning rack, if it\\'s leather/fur/cloth.\r\n\t- Make sure you also have the smithing perk requirements for that item.\r\n\t- If you\\'re sure it\\'s broken. Inform the plugin\\'s author which books are not working.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\\'m getting repeated books\r\n\t\r\n\t- Make sure you have books set to not repeat. Enter on console: set loreBookRepeat to 0\r\n\t- Remember that merchants may stock a book before you have acquired it, then after you acquire it \r\n\t  somewhere else the merchant will still have it for sale. Still, merchants shouldn\\'t get new copies \r\n\t  of it on restock.\r\n\t- If you\\'re on a killing spree with high drop chance set, you may get repeated books from loot. \r\n\t  They only stop dropping after you loot them.\r\n\t- If you have cheated your books from the testing hall, they are not removed from the database, \r\n\t  so you do get them again during normal gameplay.\r\n\t- Remember that when you reinstall a plugin it adds all books again to the Database.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
