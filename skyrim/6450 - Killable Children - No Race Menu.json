  "descriptionHtml": "1000 unique downloads and 10 endorsements! Thank you to everyone who has downloaded, and an extra thank you to those who have endorsed <3\r\n\r\nThis is exactly like Killable Children [http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=774] created by Xylozi - the exception being that they will no longer show up in the race selection menu as playable. I found it irritating so I fixed it. \r\n\r\nBest used on a clean game. I noticed that using this mid-game can cause children to be as tall as adults, until you hit them, at which point they shrink back to the size of a child. -Update to this- If the child is doing something, ex. little girl in Riverwood at the smithing stations *DO NOT* attempt to interact with her until she\\'s done - I notice that this can cause the child in question to grow to adult size and get stuck this way.\r\n\r\nThis mod is \\'as is\\' and as such you take your own risks using it. So no crying if your save file gets corrupted.\r\n\r\n18.01.2012 - Uploaded \\'Quest Protect\\' patch.",
