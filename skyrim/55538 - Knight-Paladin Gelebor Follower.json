He has served as a sentinel and Knight-Paladin at the Chantry of Auri-El for thousands of years&#34;.[/quote]\r<br />\r<br />Also available on [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=280164975]Steam[/url].\r<br />This mod, which requires the official Dawnguard DLC, allows you to recruit Gelebor the Knight-Paladin, once and only once you finish the quest &#34;Touch the Sky&#34;. He is fully voiced with vanilla assets.\r<br />\r<br />Gelebor uses his own follower system; which means you can recruit another follower alongside him without compatibility issue. Talking about compatibility, this mod is only incompatible with other mods that modify the Snow Elf race. This mod [b]is[/b] compatible with cosmetic mods that modify Gelebor himself.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/17MNdXU.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Once you tell him to wait, he will stay there forever until you come and find him. If you make him wait in a temple, in town, in your home or in a store, Gelebor will choose to sandbox in this location. If you tell him to wait somewhere else, then he will not move until you come back.\r<br />When fired, Gelebor will come back to the Auri-El temple.\r<br />\r<br />Gelebor comes with his own feature that other vanilla followers don&#39;t have.\r<br />Once you are out of combat, Gelebor will be able to help you by using his healing spells. See the video for more details.\r<br />[center][youtube]RDQnuFPOuvM[/youtube][/center]",
