Plenty of notice will be given before hand though.[/color] \r\n\r\n[img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/35892-3-1368210727.png[/img]\r\n[center]Introducing the [b]\\'Opulent Outfits Store\\'[/b].\r\nThis mod adds a store in Winterhold containing almost all of my retextures to date. All the 25 Female Mage School Robes are available UNENCHANTED, as well as the 10 additional female boots & hoods, also unenchanted. Also available are all 6 Opulent Maid Sets (all female only), including the 2 Dark editions. I deliberately didn\\'t include the Archmage\\'s outfit and the 2 Merchant sets. As this mod is still in BETA, that may change.\r\n\r\nYou DO NOT need any of my other mods installed for this to work. It is completely standalone-able. Male Mage version will be available from friday evening (GMT) on the \\'OO-MoW\\' mod page. If you want the integrated Mage Robes, head there also (links are listed below). Please also refer to my \\'Maids and Merchants\\' mod page for full details on the outfits, and for more clothing pics. I [i]will[/i] add some outfit shots here soon, I\\'ve been really busy. I hope you enjoy this mod. More to come soon.[/center]\r\n\r\n[img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/35892-4-1368210727.png[/img]\r\n[b]PLEASE NOTE:[/b]\r\n- This mod is still in BETA.  \r\n- If you havn\\'t fixed your mannequins, they may go walkies (like they do with me :)\r\n- One user has reported that his shop mannequins were naked...I have no idea why this has happened. I am working on it.\r\n- The Mannequins may have the dark face bug. I\\'m working on that too. \r\n- The lighting might also be a bit crap. Please leave comments and suggestions.\r\n- I DESPERATELY need assistance with fixing the [i]custom-TextureSet-on-a-world-object[/i] glitch. If anyone can shed some light on this, I would be eternally grateful. Please PM me.\r\n- I DESPERATELY need advice on mannequins, if there is a mannequin expert out there, could you plz PM me? \r\n- Please report ANY issues & conflicts. I REALLY want this mod to be good one.\r\n\r\n[img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/35892-1-1370617893.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/35892-5-1368210728.png[/img]\r\n[img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/33121-1-1368213076.png[/img]\r\n[center][color=#FF1493][b]Check out my other retextures: Maid\\'s & Merchants.
