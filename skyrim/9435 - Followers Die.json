  "summary": "Removes the \\\"Protected\\\" flag from followers so they can die more easily",
  "descriptionHtml": "----------------\r\nDescription\r\n----------------\r\nI never really liked the way that the PC was the only one who could kill followers. Your followers would take a beating, drop to their knees when they have had enough and get left alone. The only way they die is if you land the killing blow or if an enemy accidentally hit them while trying to kill you. I always felt like it was a bit of an immersion breaker. \r\n\r\nIf you like it endorse it. If you don\\'t, then don\\'t use it. Feedback is always welcome.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\nHow I Did It\r\n----------------\r\nI just used the CK to remove the \\\"Protected\\\" flag from follower NPCs. I didn\\'t touch essential characters so\\'s not to affect quests.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\nNote\r\n----------------\r\nRecently I have found that some followers, Lydia specifically, still seems to be protected even with the flag removed. I\\'m still working on correcting this. Let me know if you find any more problems or if you think you can fix this.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\nInstallation\r\n----------------\r\nDrop the esp into the data folder and activate with your favourite mod manager.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\nFuture\r\n----------------\r\nWho knows what it holds? If I missed any followers or you have suggestions let me know.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\nPermissions\r\n----------------\r\nIts a minor settings change really so no need to really give me credit but if you took your inspiration from my file I would be grateful for the credit.",
