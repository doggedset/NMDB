  "summary": "A large dwemer holding repurposed as a dragonborn dwelling.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Khazranthur is a rather large player home. Originally a lost dwemer site, it has been cleared out, redecorated and repurposed for the discerning dragonborn.\r\n\r\nThe grounds are divided into the following wings:\r\n- grand entry hall (entry foyer, natatorium)\r\n- residence hall (crafting hall, dining hall, master bedroom)\r\n- research wing (enchanting/alchemy room, library)\r\n- scenic grotto\r\n\r\nAmenities include:\r\n- large number of display racks for weapons, shields and helms\r\n- display rack for dragonpriest masks\r\n- display rack for claws\r\n- 7 house staff members, including 3 followers and 3 trainers\r\n- 34 custom mannequins with a variety of poses\r\n- large number of itemized storage containers\r\n- and more!\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n- Pinup Poser for the mannequins. (They will work without it, but will not allow change of pose)\r\n\r\nRevisions:\r\n1.2: fix for mannequin bug, added 6 mannequins to natatorium\r\n      If you had the mannequin bug, just updating the mod may not fix mannequins already   affected. I had to take the following steps to fix it in my own game:\r\n\r\n1) Remove all stored items from house (probably a good idea for anyone updating just to be safe).\r\n2) Move you character (and any followers or spouses) away from Khazranthur and save your game.\r\n3) Remove the mod.\r\n4) Load you new save and re-save without the mod enabled.\r\n5) Install updated version of Khazranthur.\r\n6) Enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n1.1: fix for items being marked as stolen when attempting to use custom item mounts.\r\n\r\nAdditional Credits:\r\n- AmethystDeceiver for the custom weapon/armor/etc scripts, as well as the script for the mannequins.\r\n\r\n",
