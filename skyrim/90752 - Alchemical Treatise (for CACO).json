  "modName": "Alchemical Treatise (for CACO)",
  "summary": "This mod adds a series of alchemy books written by the founder of the mages guild, Vanus Galerion, whose passion helped make magic accessible to the masses. These books were placed at lore-friendly locations around Skyrim and teach the effects of each ingredient included in them.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b]\n<br />\n<br />The books now teach the ingredient effects! No more flipping through to find what each ingredient does, just read them once and the effects will be shown the next time you go into the alchemy menu.\n<br />[/b]\n<br />The Story[/center]\n<br />   ﻿Ages ago, when Vanus Galerian was still a student on the Isle of Arteum, he found the notes of Asliel Direnni which had been passed down through the generations. After leaving to found the Mage's Guild, he worked with two master alchemists to finish and publish these notes. The set contains 9 books, organized by type of ingredient, and a reference book of the most powerful ingredients for each effect. One of the alchemists, Gildor Inglorian, hated that Galerian refused to include the ingredients from men, mer, and beastfolk, so he created his own volume that included these. These books are pretty rare (mages aren't known for being careful with their research materials), but at least one copy of each can be found in Skyrim, and the more common books can be found in multiple places and occasionally in an alchemy shop. Other alchemists are looking for these books too, so some in the wild might have clues for where to search.\n<br />[center]\n<br />Details[/center]   [center][/center]   ﻿This mod adds a set of 11 books to the game that teach the effects of the different ingredients in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69306/]CACO[/url]. Each book focuses on ingredients from a different type of source (plants, animals, etc) except for the reference book that contains lists of the most potent ingredients for each potion effect. There are also versions that contain ingredients from some other mods that I use- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/76203/]BOT[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/23771]SkyBirds[/url], and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33201]H[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33201]unterborn[/url], and I'm planning to make a version with Immersive Creatures.The books are:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Of the Dirt (Bugs)\n<br />[*]Of Flora I- Flowers, Fruits, and Nuts\n<br />[*]Of Flora II- Leaves, Roots, and Mushrooms\n<br />[*]Of the Waters\n<br />[*]Of the Skies\n<br />[*]Of the Beasts\n<br />[*]Of the Children of Auri-El and Y'ffre (giants, spriggans, etc)\n<br />[*]Of the Unnatural and Otherworldly\n<br />[*]Of Minerals and Gems (pearls, salts, oils)\n<br />[*]Reference: Potent Ingredients\n<br />[*]Of Black Alchemy\n<br />[/list]\n<br />   ﻿The first three are common books- they are available through alchemy shops and have multiple definite locations. The next three are less common, but are still occasionally found at shops and and in a couple of locations. The next four are rare- they are found in only one location each, but, if you're lucky, you might find a copy at the Arcaneum. There is only one copy of the last one. Some alchemists that are in the wild (ie not shopowners) have clues to help you find the more rare books.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Credits-\n<br />ruritania from dafont.com\n<br />lots of brushes from Leichman and Lileya at Deviantart.com\n<br />Leather base from Tony Thomas at https://medialoot.com/item/distressed-leather-textures/\n<br />Better Book Meshes - https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37113?tab=description",
