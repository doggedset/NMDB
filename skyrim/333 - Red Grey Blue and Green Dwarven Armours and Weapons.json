  "descriptionHtml": "Four sets of modified Dwarven textures that will replace every Dwarven items (armours and weapons) for both male and female characters.\r\n\r\nNEW FILE available separately (check it out if you like Dwarven Armours):\r\n\r\nSteel Dwarven Armour and Weapons\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=373\r\n\r\nWeapons and shield are included and it has a different look (the no shiny option is included by default). \r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\n\r\nI really like the design of Dwarven armours and weapons but I\\'m not too keen on the golden hue they display so I\\'ve decided to extract the textures and do a quick retex job. \r\n\r\nThis will replace existing textures but you can revert to the original by simply deleting the files.\r\n\r\nThere are two sets of textures one that is grey and less saturated than the original so it doesn\\'t have that golden hue anymore and another one that is more reddish with a slightly different tone. \r\n\r\nYou can pick either one or combine them if you want reddish Dwarven weapons with the grey Dwarven armour then all you have to do is copy the armor folder from the Grey file and the weapon folder from the red file. \r\n\r\nThe way they look in game may differ depending on the resolution and settings you\\'re using. Some mods like custom shaders and stuff will make a difference too. \r\n\r\nThis is not a high definition retex. All I did was extract the textures from the BSA archive and apply some minor modifications to the DDS files to get a slighty different look in game. \r\n\r\nUpdated with two new sets, blue and green.\r\n\r\nOptional file\r\n============\r\n\r\nA non shiny option that can be used with any texture set (including vanilla) simply extract in data folder. If you don\\'t want this to apply to weapons only copy the armor folder from the mod folder. \r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n\r\nExtract this archive to any folder and then copy the files to the Data folder.\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\n\r\nDelete the textures from the data folder.\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n===============\r\n\r\nIt should be compatible with most mods that don\\'t modify textures for Dwarven gear.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for another great game and thanks to the TESNexus for being so awesome.\r\n\r\n===============\r\n\r\nFeel free to upload pictures of your characters wearing Dwarven gear if you like the mod. \r\n\r\nHave a nice game! ;)",
