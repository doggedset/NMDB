  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3]This mod simply fixes the missing hairlines beneath helmets and hats when using Kai's HDT Vanilla [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88114]Male[/url]/[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88135]Female[/url] Hairstyles. There's not much more to say!\n<br />\n<br />Each hair uses its vanilla hairline- that's the slot underneath helmets, hats, and the hair slot itself. The [b]hairlines[/b] do not have HDT physics, but the [b]hair itself[/b] does- you'll have your beautiful, free-flowing locks when your head is bare, and you'll have some warm softness beneath your helmet or hat when it's time to trick-catch an arrow with your face or keep the rain and snow off.\n<br />\n<br />There are two files: A male version and a female version. The original mods by Kaidra are [b]not required[/b] and actively conflict with the fixes used here- uninstall the original before using this mod.\n<br />\n<br />Install/Uninstall the mod using Mod Organizer or the Nexus Mod Manager, as per usual.\n<br />\n<br />If you're feeling lucky, punk, move the files around manually. (Please don't, that's a messy way to do things.)\n<br />\n<br />This mod has been created and uploaded with the permission of [b]Kaidra[/b], who deserves the credit or endorsements or votes or donations or appreciative character screenshots or whathaveyou you'd like to give. Finally having HDT vanilla hair conversions after all these years is awesome, many thanks to him for putting these mods up!\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff0000]AS A PSA: [/color][/b][color=#e06666]In both this fixed version and the original mod, [color=#ffffff][b][u]HairFemaleNordHDT18[/u][/b][/color] appears partially translucent in the [color=#ffffff][b]Alternate Start : Live Another Life[/b][/color] starting cell. This effect does [color=#ffffff][i]not[/i] [i]remain[/i][/color] after selecting a start and/or moving away from this specific area- so don't let the initial bugginess turn you off this hairstyle. [color=#ffffff]It works fine.[/color][/color]\n<br />[/size]",
