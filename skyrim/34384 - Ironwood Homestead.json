  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]\r<br />[center][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65163/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/QtD7v94.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />After tons of testing, this is ready to be released&#33; I personally do not like huge houses too much, but after several people requested a house big enough for all their followers, I decided to give it a shot. I tried my best to keep away from the preconception of big houses being a huge empty hall with just 200 mannequins, 300 weapon plaques, and a bed - rather, I went for a lived-in, cozy environment, despite the size of the place. The project turned out to be really fun, and I&#39;m excited to share it. \r<br />\r<br />Located to the west of Greenspring Hollow and across the river from a dragon mound, Ironwood Homestead is a very roomy house with a pleasant view of Whiterun&#39;s plains, fully navmeshed and with plenty of amenities. There are bards, jesters, and entertainers, who will occasionally engage in some amusing dialogue; cheerful background music; merchants of all sorts (spells, blacksmith, apothecary, food, and general trader), blacksmith tools, enchanting and alchemy stations, bookcases, all shrines to the Divines, some crops and livestock, a grand total of 32 beds, a big armory, a small sauna, a map marker, a porch with a nice view of the nearby forest, and a ridiculous amount of idle markers to keep your followers busy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />French translation by keitaka available [url=http://www.confrerie-des-traducteurs.fr/skyrim/mods/bordeciel/habitations/demeure_dironwood]here[/url]. Thank you&#33;\r<br />\r<br />A small word of warning, though; the weapon racks are being annoying. You can place weapons in them, but it becomes impossible to remove them later, at least in my game. So, choose wisely what to put in them&#33; The rest of the weapon plaques, shield racks, mannequins and display cases are working just fine, fortunately.\r<br />\r<br />[b]FINDING THE KEY[/b]\r<br />\r<br />The house has a quest of sorts attached to it, with a brand-spankin&#39;-new, bandit-infested little mine for you to clear and be a hero&#33; My skills in this field are not that big, so hopefully it will not give you much trouble. The first time you arrive to Ironwood Homestead, you&#39;ll see some bandits attacking, so make sure to check their pockets after you show them who&#39;s boss. That should get you started. If you get stuck, let me know, and I&#39;ll help you out.\r<br />\r<br />In case of trouble, I put a copy in a strongbox hidden in the mine. Look near the cooking spit&#33; And, if you cannot find it still, you can spawn the key. Just type &#39;help ironwood&#39; on the console and the key ID will appear. \r<br />\r<br />[b]MOVING IN[/b]\r<br />In order to have your spouse or your followers move into the house, you&#39;ll need two mods; &#34;Spouses Can Live Everywhere&#34; and &#34;My Home is your Home&#34;. No mod has yet been made to move adopted children to custom houses, unfortunately.\r<br />\r<br />I hope you have as much fun using Ironwood Homestead to house your follower army as I did putting it together&#33; If you spot any problems (besides the issue with the silly weapon racks), please let me know.\r<br />\r<br />And now, a disclaimer - if you come around complaining this is exactly like Dragonsreach, I will cut you. Believe it or not, this was a lot of work&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]CHANGELOG:[/b]\r<br />\r<br />4/15/2014:\r<br />Uploaded a new file that I tried to make compatible with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29249/?]Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions[/url]. It has not been tested thoroughly because I only have Hearthfire for the food and do not plan on adopting children, but if I could get more people to help me test this out, I&#39;d be very thankful. Download v03b and overwrite the .esp file with the new one. Back up your saves just in case&#33;\r<br />\r<br />8/13/2013:\r<br />Uploaded NPCs&#39; FaceGenData to fix the issue where some people are getting the grey face bug, despite the fact that the NPCs&#39; textures and meshes are included in the bsa. If you are having this problem, download the optional file and extract the contents to your &#39;SteamSteamAppsCommonSkyrimData&#39; folder, overwriting if needed. Feel free to delete the old bsa afterwards to save some hard-drive space.\r<br />\r<br />4/26/13: \r<br />- For people having trouble with the bandits not having the key, I put a copy in a strongbox hidden in the mine. Look near the cooking spit&#33;\r<br />- Allied the Personnel faction to itself, so  hopefully that will stop the rare issue where everybody would be fighting each other on arrival. \r<br />- I *think* I found a way to make bards play at random. Let me know if it works&#33;\r<br />\r<br />4/15/13: \r<br />Added French translation by clads7, which you can find as an optional version. Thank you so much&#33;\r<br />\r<br />4/13/13:\r<br />- Placed an additional small smithing room in the basement with a grindstone, a workbench, a shield plaque, and some storage. \r<br />- Corrected some lasting ownership issues with alchemist&#39;s plates.\r<br />- Managed to get one of the weapon racks working properly, the one right by the stairs next to a bookcase. Still no luck with the others.\r<br />- Changed equipment of guards to make them more neutral. Now there are two guards inside the house and three outside. \r<br />- Assembled a small combat training area/archery range by the blacksmith with some cooled wine for those hot tiresome days.\r<br />- Turned all outdoors personnel essential. \r<br />- Added walls and watchtowers to the outside for additional protection. \r<br />- Built a small room behind the trophy area with a couple of beds for household personnel. \r<br />- Finally found and removed the floating copy of the house near Bleakwind Basin - thank you, The Nightingale128 on Steam Workshop&#33;\r<br />\r<br />4/9/13:\r<br />- Placed two groundskeepers in the garden to look after your crops and livestock.\r<br />- Removed the silly food platters that kept glitching around and placed good ole silver bowls with fruit instead.\r<br />- Fixed ownership of enchanting items so now they should be free to take. \r<br />- Added a nifty throne of sorts. I didn&#39;t want to use one of the premade thrones because they fix the camera on the player and it would be impossible to sit back and enjoy the view, so I put one together. Let me know what you think&#33; It is also set to belong to the player only, so hopefully you will not arrive and find someone else sitting on your rightful seat.\r<br />- Added a priest who will sell religious amulets and some books.\r<br />- Gave all merchants except the cook and the priest 1500 extra gold for trading. \r<br />- Originally wanted to put an extra mannequin and two weapon plaques to the bedroom, but for some reason they refused to work, so instead I put two display cases and an empty chest. I&#39;ll try to figure out the issue, but hopefully the new additions will be good enough for now&#33;\r<br />\r<br />4/4/13:\r<br />Initial release.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I originally made this mod for the Steam Workshop. Link [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136750790]here[/url]. To install, place the files in your &#39;SteamSteamAppsCommonSkyrimData&#39; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
