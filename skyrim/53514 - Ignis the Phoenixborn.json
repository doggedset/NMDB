After that Ignis found a note dropped by the Thalmor captain with the orders and their symbol, and then he swore revenge on the Thalmor and went to Skyrim to get it.\r<br />\r<br />Name: Ignis\r<br />Race: Breton\r<br />Gender: Male\r<br />Age: 25\r<br />Class: Mage\r<br />Level 80 (you can change it with console commands if you want)\r<br />Spells: Fireball, Incinerate, Fire Storm, Flame cloak, Fire Breath Shout\r<br />Location: Bannered mare in Whiterun\r<br />Marriageable: Yes\r<br />",
