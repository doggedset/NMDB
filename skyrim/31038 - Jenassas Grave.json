  "summary": "A mod for Gix and his fans.",
  "descriptionHtml": "In one of Gix\\'s Skyrim LP episodes, Jenassa had been killed and he wanted to make a mod adding a gravestone at her death place for his game. Upon watching the episode I immediately got to work and cooked up this mod in 15 minutes. It saves Gix from having to make it himself, but at the same time it\\'s also for his fellow fans if they want to feel like they are a part of Gix\\'s (his character) world or if Jenassa had died in their game. Enjoy!",
