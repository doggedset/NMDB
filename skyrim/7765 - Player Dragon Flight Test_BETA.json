  "summary": "A test with player dragon flight. Experimental. No moving after takeoff, but takeoff, hovering and landing is possible. Very glitchy. Use at your own risk.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I thought I would have a go at making player \\'dragons\\' able to fly using the commands. This is only an experiment, however, upon release of the creation kit I hope to be able to do some more. I happened to stumble across a combination of commands that worked. \r\n\r\n*ATTENTION* Using these commands in incorrect places (on the side of a cliff) may cause your game to crash. The commands are very temperamental.  Currently, all you can do is takeoff and hover. Landing is kinda glitched up as you seem to be forced to a certain position.\r\n\r\nThis is only a test using command console for fun.\r\nThe commands may make your game glitchy, so make sure to back up saves and use at your own risk.\r\nPlease do not claim this idea as your own.\r\n",
