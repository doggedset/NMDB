  "descriptionHtml": "This Mod adds the man of a mystery, and Mr. Gulliver\\'s room to Whiterun. \r\nThe place of the room should look at SS1. \r\n\r\nThis is using Gulliver\\'s Travels as the motif. \r\nHowever, the all were created with the joke. \r\nOnly those who understand a joke need to use.\r\n\r\nThere is a big door in the room. \r\nNothing is prepared for this point. \r\nThere is also no key. \r\nIt is easy to cause a fall accident in the neighborhood from which a follower flies and moves to the headdress of a bear. \r\nI was not able to correct this well.\r\nIncidentally, since it seems that Mr. Gulliver was saving money in somewhere in rooms, please search.",
