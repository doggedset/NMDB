  "descriptionHtml": "\r<br />What is this:\r<br />This mod basically adds a framework and abilities to emulate a Paladin class. It uses a new pool called Piety to manage how many Paladin abilities can be used within a 24hr time frame (game time). It also attempts to track the players actions and penalize the Piety pool appropriately. In most other Paladin class definitions, magic is a no-no, but in this definition its use will not strip the Paladin of paladin defining abilities. Instead it uses a lore friendly system to temporarily handicap the Paladin and make magic use problematic (except restoration spells).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Basic Abilities:\r<br />\r<br />Adherent of the divines ( Lvl 1 )\r<br />-    Whispers and Auras become available.\r<br />-     Rumination of the Divines: Daily prayer that resets Piety, cures diseases and grants all shrine blessings.\r<br />-    Plea for Redemption: Spell that attempts to remove some Piety penalties by sacrificing a filled black soul gem (freeing the soul).\r<br />-    Mortal magic use will disrupt attunement for the Paladin for 10 minutes.\r<br />\r<br />Acolyte of the Divines ( Lvl 10 )\r<br />-    Commands become available.\r<br />-    Radiance of the Divine: Paladin deals x2 weapon dmg vs Undead and Daedric enemies (hidden perk)\r<br />-    Mortal magic use will disrupt attunement for the Paladin for 6 minutes.\r<br />\r<br />Champion of the Divines ( Lvl 20 )\r<br />-     Granted the greater power &#34;Divine Transference&#34; that allows the Paladin to transfer enchantments.\r<br />-    Words become available.\r<br />-    Mortal magic use will disrupt attunement for the Paladin for 3 minutes.\r<br />\r<br />Hand of the Gods ( Lvl 30)\r<br />-    Mortal magic use will no longer disrupt the attunement for the Paladin.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />=======================================================================================================================\r<br />\r<br />Deity Specific Abilities:\r<br />\r<br />Disciple of Akatosh, Time\r<br />-    whisper: stamina, magika and health regen for 5 minutes\r<br />-    word: pbaoe debuff for magika, health and stamina regen\r<br />-    command: single target debuff for speed multi&#39;s. melee, bow and movement\r<br />    \r<br />Disciple of Arkay, Life and Death\r<br />-    whisper: Poison and disease resistance self buff\r<br />-    word: pb aoe health absorb with 3 second stun\r<br />-    command: single target health absorb with stagger\r<br />-    aura: frost cloak effect for 60s\r<br />    \r<br />Disciple of Dibella, Beauty\r<br />-    whisper: invisibility for 60s\r<br />-    word: Pbaoe Pacify for 30 seconds\r<br />-    command: Single target charm humanoid of users level or less for 60 seconds\r<br />    \r<br />Disciple of Julianos, Magic\r<br />-    whisper: 20% magic resistance for 5 minutes\r<br />-    word: pb aoe 20pt mana absorb for\r<br />-    command: Dispels targets active magic effects\r<br />    \r<br />Disciple of Kynareth, Air\r<br />-    whisper: Water breathing for 3 minutes\r<br />-    word: pb aoe push (unrelenting force)\r<br />-    command: Suffocate single target for 60 seconds\r<br />-    aura: Lightning cloak effect for 60 seconds\r<br />\r<br />Disciple of Mara, Love\r<br />-    whisper: Increase health, magika and stamina for 5 minutes\r<br />-    word: Pbaoe buff for friendly npcs. increases health magika and stamina for 5 minutes.\r<br />-    command: Increase confidence for 60s and restore 50pt of health, magicka and stamina.\r<br />    \r<br />Disciple of Stendarr, Mercy\r<br />-    whisper: armor and fire/shock/frost resistance self buff\r<br />-    word: pbaoe armor and resistance buff\r<br />-    command: Large heal to target health, magicka and stamina\r<br />-    aura: flame cloak effect for 60s\r<br />    \r<br />Disciple of Talos, Mankind\r<br />-    whisper: Increase melee haste by 30%.\r<br />-    word: pbaoe stun\r<br />-    command: single target stun\r<br />    \r<br />Disciple of Zenithar, Commerce\r<br />-    whisper: Increased movement speed for 3 minutes.\r<br />-    word: pb aoe frenzy of casters level or less (word of greed)\r<br />-    command: Opens a trade window with target npc\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />=======================================================================================================================\r<br />    \r<br />Piety:\r<br />Piety is the &#34;pool&#34; used to power the divine abilities of a Paladin. This pool doe not regenerate and can only be refilled by using a daily power called &#34;Rumination of the Divines&#34;. Base Piety is calculated at 10 per level and is adjusted by bonuses and penalties defined by the Paladin&#39;s actions.\r<br />    \r<br />Using Magic:\r<br />The Paladin is able to use magic normally without offending the Gods just by its use. But due to the required mindset of magic use by requiring the caster to focus as if they where the center of all creation, it disrupts the attunement/humility required by the Paladin to access the divine. Only the school of restoration has the proper mindset to allow the paladin to rapidly switch between mortal magic and divine magic. When casting spells from Conjuration, Destruction, Alteration or Illusion the Paladin&#39;s attunement will be broken for a period of time defined by their level.\r<br />    \r<br />Offences to the Gods:\r<br />When the Paladin commits an act that offends the Gods, he/she will have their Piety total reduced until they make amends. The spell &#34;plea for Redemption&#34; is used to offer a Black Soul Gem (by freeing the trapped soul) to the Gods as an attempt to demonstrate humility and devotion. There is only a 25% chance per attempt the Gods will grant mercy and restore some the penalized Piety. There are many actions that will cause a penalty and it is tallied when casting their daily Rumination of the Divine, such as trapping a soul in a soul gem, destroying a soul by using it to enchant or charge a magic weapon, murder, theft and of course doing favors for dark entities or organizations.\r<br />\r<br />Acquiring,Selecting and Using Paladin abilities:\r<br />The Paladin&#39;s abilities are all voice abilities like shouts. The abilities will automatically be added as you progress when you cast your daily Rumination of the Divines ability. When you run out of Piety, the ability will be disabled by not allowing you to equip it any longer until you get more piety. So don&#39;t be shocked when you click to equip it and it refuses to equip. Currently the ability costs are static, auras cost 1 piety, whispers 5, commands 10 and words 20. You will not have sufficient Piety to spam Paladin abilities so you need to be a little selective in their use.\r<br />\r<br />Divine Transference:\r<br />This ability will allow the Paladin to transfer an enchantment from one item to another item for the same slot that the Paladin has equipped. For weapons the receiving weapon needs to be equipped in the right hand or two handed. The process to use this ability is for the Paladin to drop the item with the desired enchantment on the ground in front of him. He then equips the item he wants to receive the enchantment in the appropriate equipment slot. Then the Paladin uses the ability then moves the cross hair across the item on the ground. A notification in the top left will let you know how the process worked out. The renaming of the weapon is a little buggy, so afterwards you need to drop the weapon on the ground then pick it back up and the correct name will be visible. The weapon will have zero charges at this point so it is recommended to use a passive recharge mod. This power is only usable once per day.\r<br />\r<br />Recommendations:\r<br />    Acquire an armor mod with appropriate paladin armors/weapons.\r<br />    Install a mod allowing mounted combat.\r<br />    Locate a mod that adds an enchanter NPC, because enchanting yourself will be crippling =)\r<br />    Adding a dodge mod will be beneficial\r<br />    Passive recharge for weapon charges.\r<br />\r<br />Note:\r<br />I have mostly tested this by playing it =)  So if you notice anything wrong, feel free to yell at me.....\r<br />\r<br />=======================================================================================================================\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />    SKSE : http://skse.silverlock.org/download/\r<br />    \r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />    Everything is basically from scratch, so there should be no compatibility issues.\r<br />    \r<br />Credits:\r<br />    Thanks to SKSE for such a fine addition of functions, events, etc...\r<br />    \r<br />Installation:\r<br />    Please use Nexus Mod Manager.
