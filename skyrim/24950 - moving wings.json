  "descriptionHtml": "This is  sets of animated moving wings for your character. They are craftable at a tanning rack after you collect the ingredients. They are quiver wings meaning the game thinks they are arrows and to use a bow you need to switch quivers, use bow and arrows, then re-equip quiver-wings. This is a reupload of a previous mod by me. Check the video to see the wing types. For males and females, all races.\r<br />The wings are found in weapons ammo in inventory after you craft them.\r<br />\r<br />THESE WINGS ARE FOR VANILLA SKELETON WITH NO ARROW OR QUIVER MODS &#33;\r<br />\r<br />DO NOT upload anywhere else and permission is needed from me to use assets, thanks",
