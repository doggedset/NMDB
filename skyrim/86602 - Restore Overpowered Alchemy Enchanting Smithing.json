  "descriptionHtml": "INTRODUCTION\r<br />============\r<br />This mod is meant to restore the overpowered Alchemy, Enchanting and Smithing effects from base Skyrim, when other mods have changed how they work.\r<br />\r<br />WHAT DOES IT DO?\r<br />================\r<br />It replaces the three entries of Fortify Alchemy, Fortify Enchanting and Fortify Smithing with the ones from the Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch (USLEEP), which means that they will again increase the magnitude of effects (rather than increasing skill levels, as the one in Complete Crafting Overhaul does).\r<br />\r<br />Note that it also changes the base cost level back to base Skyrim values.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION\r<br />============\r<br />Make sure that the Restore Overpowered Alchemy Enchant Smithing.esp is loaded AFTER any other mods.\r<br />\r<br />DEPENDENCIES\r<br />============\r<br />Other than the main Skyrim master, it has none. It is neither dependent on USLEEP nor on any other mod.\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS\r<br />=======\r<br />The Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch from which I took the text values of the entries.\r<br />The authors of TES5Edit, with which the mod was created.",
