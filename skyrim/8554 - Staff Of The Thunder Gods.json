  "descriptionHtml": "Slightly buggy if you wield it in your right hand you cast it as a spell....don\\'t know how to fix it...don\\'t particularly want to.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow on to the discription;\r\n\r\nThe power to command Lightning is easier for all with The Staff Of The Thunder Gods, The enchantment on the staff allows all of you puny mortals the power of the Lightning Storm regardless of your experience with the magics.\r\nThe Staff has an infinite charge for those with hilarious intents.\r\nYes its a cheat and no i wont make a non-cheat version... Games are meant to fave fun with not to take seriously... ok enough philosophy...have fun, or not...whatever\r\n\r\nIt\\'s a pretty simple mod and you can imagine what it looks like with no new textures or meshes so i\\'m not gonna upload pictures, but feel free to if you wish. It matters not to I.\r\n\r\nAlso it is in Breezehome In the master bedroom",
