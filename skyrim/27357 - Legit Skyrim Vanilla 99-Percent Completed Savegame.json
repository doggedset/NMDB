These quests are not completed because i feel that you should still be able to marry anyone you want and that you should have the choice to kill Paarthurnax or not. You can choose to complete these quests on your own.\r\n² The locations: Glenmoril Coven and Wolfskull Cave are not cleared because of a bug that could not be fixed.\r\n³ There\\'s a chance a guard will take some of the keys when caught stealing.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1a (vanilla game + Dawnguard dlc completed)\r\n\r\nHours played: 128 hours 2 minutes\r\nSide in the dlc: Volkihar Vampires path\r\n\r\nThe Vanilla + Dawnguard DLC Savegame A includes:\r\n-Completion of everything mentioned in version 1.0\r\n-Completion of all Dawnguard quests¹ \r\n-Completion of all non-repeatable Dawnguard misc. objectives\r\n-All books collected²\r\n-All spells learned²*\r\n-All Dawnguard locations found²\r\n-All Possible Dawnguard locations cleared³\r\n-All Dragon Shouts unlocked\r\n-All ingredient effects known\r\n-Collected all armor and weapons smithing can make\r\n-Collected all paragons and found their treasures\r\n-Collected most unique weapons and armor\r\n-All Vampire perks unlocked\r\n-All Werewolf perks unlocked**\r\n-Full potential of the bloodstone chalice unlocked\r\n-Turned all three target npc\\'s into vampires\r\n-Defeated The Reaper in Soul Cairn\r\n\r\n¹ The quest: The Gift is not completed because you need a spouse for that and i don\\'t have one for the reason mentioned in version 1.0 . You can chose to complete this quest on your own once you have married someone.\r\n² Some spells, books and locations can only be learned, collected or found if you side with the Dawnguard Werewolves, and since i sided with the Volkihar Vampires i couldn\\'t obtain them.\r\n³ The location: Arkngthamz is cleared but does not show as cleared due to a bug.\r\n* Spell count in general stats is messed up because when you drink blood as a vampire the game thinks you\\'ve learned a new spell.\r\n** I unlocked all Werewolf perks, however I can\\'t turn into a werewolf anymore without the use of the console commands. This is because Aela already turned me into one to get the werewolf perks and then i changed back to vampire so she won\\'t offer me to become a werewolf anymore. If you still desire to be a werewolf you can cure yourself of Vampyrism and use the console command: player.addspell 00092c48 to become one. \r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1b (vanilla game + Dawnguard dlc completed)\r\n\r\nHours played: 121 hours 27 minutes \r\nSide in the dlc: Dawnguard Werewolves path\r\n\r\nThe Vanilla + Dawnguard DLC Savegame B includes:\r\n-Everything mentioned in version 1.1a , except the Vampire specific tasks  \r\n-Fully upgraded the Dawnguard crossbow and bolts\r\n-Found all Dawnguard relics\r\n\r\n* The locations: Arkngthamz and Ruunvald excavation are cleared but do not show as cleared due to a bug.\r\n** One spell could not be obtained because you need to side with the vampires for that.\r\n*** I did not cure Serana\\'s Vampyrism so you can still cure her if you want to.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2a and b (vanilla game + Dawnguard and Hearthfire dlc completed)\r\n\r\nHours played: 131 hours 50 minutes (A) / 123 hours 7 minutes (B)\r\n\r\nThe Vanilla + Dawnguard and Hearthfire dlc savegame includes:\r\n-Everything mentioned in version 1.0 and 1.1a or 1.1b\r\n-All houses built\r\n-All houses fully furnished\r\n-All children\\'s clothing and toys collected\r\n-All ingredient effects known\r\n* I did not adopt any children so you can still adopt whoever you want.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 1.3a (Vanilla game + Dawnguard + Hearthfire + Dragonborn completed)\r\n\r\nHours played: 156 hours 59 minutes\r\nPreviously sided with: Volkihar vampires in the Dawnguard dlc\r\n\r\nThe Vanilla + Dawnguard + Hearthfire and Dragonborn savegame includes:\r\n-Everything mentioned in previous versions (1.0, 1.1a and 1.2a)\r\n-Completion of all Dragonborn quests¹                                                            \r\n-Completion of all non-repeatable Dragonborn misc. objectives²              \r\n-All Dragonborn locations found                                  \r\n-All possible Dragonborn locations cleared                           \r\n-All dragon shouts unlocked                      \r\n-All possible active effects unlocked                                  \r\n-All spells learned                              \r\n-All enchantments known                         \r\n-All alchemy ingredient effects known  \r\n-All Deathbrand treasure found                                                                                   \r\n-Collected all books and spell tomes     \r\n-Collected all black books                        \r\n-Collected all keys                              \r\n-Collected all all armor and weapons smithing can make                   \r\n-Collected all unique weapons and armor³          \r\n-Collected all dragon priest masks\r\n-Severin Manor owned                    \r\n-Defeated karstaag \r\n-Uncovered the secrets of Kagrumez                                    \r\n-Unlocked the bow of the stag prince its full potential               \r\n\r\n¹ By doing the quest: \\\"Retaking thirsk\\\" instead of the quest \\\"The chief of Thirsk hall\\\" i\\'ve lost the ability to have rieklings as a follower. However it might still be possible with UFO:http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037 or console commands.\r\n² There are some misc. objectives left in the journal, but these are repeatable.\r\n³ I\\'m missing 4 unique rings due to the fact that you can only get them if you\\'re a werewolf.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 1.3b (Vanilla game + Dawnguard + Hearthfire + Dragonborn completed)\r\n\r\nHours played: 136 hours 39 minutes\r\nPreviously sided with: Dawnguard Werewolves in the Dawnguard dlc\r\n\r\nThe Vanilla + Dawnguard + Hearthfire and Dragonborn savegame includes:\r\n-Everything mentioned in previous versions (1.0, 1.1b, 1.2b)\r\n-Everything mentioned in version 1.3a\r\n-Collected all 4 unique Werewolf rings\r\n\r\n* I sided with the Rieklings in this save so you can have Rieklings as a follower now.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve moved everything from my Markarth house to the Raven rock house in version 1.3a and 1.3b, so you can find everything you need there. I\\'ve added pictures how to find everything in this house in the images section of this mod.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to change race or appearance of my character use the console command: showracemenu or visit the face sculptor in Riften if you have Dawnguard installed. If you want to remove/add perks/perk points use the console commands or read waking dreams if you have Dragonborn installed.",
