Unfortunately, this knowledge would cost her life! Fortunately for you however her discoveries are recorded in her journal so you can pick up where she left off. Your adventure begins in Castle Volkihar, in the kitchen. There you will find the Archaeologist\\\\\\'s corpse, ready to be butchered and served to the Volkihar Court. Loot her journal from the body, and it will be your guide to finding and claiming Black Tongue Tower. The journal is pretty short, but if you want you can skip ahead to the page that lists names of four dead men in four dungeons. Find their remains in those dungeons and grab the keys. Then head off to Black Tongue Tower complete your adventure and claim your new sinister home! [color=red] NOTE: There are no quest markers associated with the keys so you\\'ll have to find them the old fashioned way. This is by design!
