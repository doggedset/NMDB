I always play a stealthy character and there just aren\\'t any really good stealthy followers IMO.\r\n\r\nI don\\'t know why it took so long to think of doing this and I don\\'t think anyone else has either. Anyway, presenting... drumroll please... Uthgerd the Raging Beauty Ranger.\r\n\r\n=================================================================\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\nFully compatible with Follower Tweaks - Several Flavors by Expired which can be found here: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3111 Just make sure the Uthgerd esp loads after Follower Tweaks.\r\n\r\nUthgerd is essential.\r\n\r\nShe is a Ranger - deadly with a bow and competent with blade and shield.\r\nMost importantly, Uthgerd is stealthy as a cobra and if you add some sneak enhanced items she will be even more so. Her skills have been altered to use light armor to further facilitate stealth.\r\n\r\nFinally, before you ask, the armor she is wearing in the pic is SilverX10 by Thor925 which can be found here: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5404\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nExtract and add the Data folder to your skyrim directory.\r\n\r\n================================================================\r\n\r\nRecommended files:\r\n\r\nIf you want the full look of the pic you will want to use the following:\r\n\r\nBetter Females by Bella\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\n\r\nBright Eyes v1-3 by Skree000\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2464\r\n\r\n===============================================================\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to:\r\nThor925 my modding mentor\r\nforetrenty for his Skyrim NPC Editor 0.52\r\nExpired for his Follower Tweaks mod",
