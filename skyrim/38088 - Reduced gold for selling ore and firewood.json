  "modName": "Reduced gold for selling ore and firewood",
  "summary": "Reduces the amount of gold that mine owners pay you for ore and that mill owners / farmers pay you for firewood.",
  "descriptionHtml": "You enter an owned mine, dig up a piece of ore worth 25 gold and the mine owner pays you...25 gold?!  How do the mine owners make a profit if they pay their workers the full value of the ore?\r\n\r\nThis mod reduces the amount of gold that mine owners will pay you by 40%.  The price paid for firewood however is dropped to a mere 1 gold due to the fact that firewood is basically infinite.\r\n\r\nWith vanilla barter settings, selling directly to mine owners will still be more profitable than selling it to a merchant, even up to a speechcraft skill of 100 (not including perks).\r\n\r\nThis mod is aimed at those who prefer tougher in-game economies / a little more realism.  Of course, you can still take all of a mine\\'s ore and wander off without handing it in.  Some honesty is required on the part of the player. :P\r\n\r\n    Vanilla Price -----> New Price \r\n\r\nFirewood       5 ---> 1\r\nIron               7 ---> 4\r\nCorundum    20 ---> 12\r\nOrichalcum  20 ---> 12\r\nSilver           25 ---> 15\r\nQuicksilver   25 ---> 15\r\nMalachite     30 ---> 18\r\nMoonstone   30 ---> 18\r\nGold            50 ---> 30\r\nEbony          60 ---> 36\r\n\r\n\r\nNMM Install = Click the \\'Download With Manager\\' button\r\nManual Install = Download the zip file, extract and place ReducedJobGold.esp in your Skyrim Data folder.\r\n\r\nThis mod modifies the values of the \\'Job\\' globals.  If you have other mods that alter these values, you will have to put this .esp after it in your load order for the changes to work.",
