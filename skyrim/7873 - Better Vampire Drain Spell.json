  "summary": "Made Vampire Drain Spell less pointless and unbalanced.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Lets face it. The vampire drain spell that you get is pretty week and pointless. Even if you dual cast it, it still does little damage and benefits you little in trying to get back HP. Not only that but once again shows how unfavorable unbalanced vamparism is in skyrim. \r\n\r\nSince i am working on my vampire mod i figured i would get a head start in making my changes.\r\n\r\nPOWER INCREASE:\r\n\r\nNow each level of vampirism you progress the damage doubles and is as fallows:\r\n\r\nNOTE: the magika cost has increased as well but with perks it helps; and is still balanced. \r\n\r\nLevel 1:\r\n2 damage\r\n\r\nLevel 2:\r\n4\r\n\r\nLevel 3:\r\n8\r\n\r\nLevel 4:\r\n16\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\nJust unzip it with 7z and drop the ESP into your data folder and select it from the game menu.\r\n\r\nPLEASE COMMENT:\r\nSince my mode is still in alpha pieces, it would be really helpful to get some feed back on it, i.e. to strong, not balanced, ect.
