  "descriptionHtml": "I always thought the deadric armour and weapons never lived up to their expectations, so I just gave them a bit of a damage and armour boost and I decreased the weights. This mod does not change the enchantments because I thought they were fine. I pnly changed 5\r<br />The base damage and armour. With staffs I couldn&#39;t do much so I just increased the speed they cast the spells.Â \r<br />\r<br />If anyone has any suggestions or ideas please leave let me know\r<br />",
