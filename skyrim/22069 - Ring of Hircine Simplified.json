  "modId": 22069.0,
  "modName": "Ring of Hircine Simplified",
  "summary": "Changes the Ring of Hircine to automatically cast beast form when the ring is equipped, rather than requiring you to use the spell. This lets you favorite the ring and use it whenever you want. Ring is unequipped when you transform, so the effect wears off.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is the first mod I\\'ve uploaded for Skyrim, and its pretty simple. I simply changed the \\\"ring of hircine\\\" power to an ability so it casts beast form on you as soon as the ring is equipped. I love it, and i figured I\\'d share it for all the werewolf fans. It still only works if you are a werewolf through the Companions quest. I haven\\'t seen anyone else do this, but if its already a mod, let me know.\r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\nIncompatible with anything that modifies the ring of hircine spell, or possibly the ring. Compatible with werewolf overhauls, Dawnguard, etc.  Or at least it should be.\r\n\r\nBugs: \r\nI haven\\'t noticed any, and its a pretty simple plugin so I can\\'t imagine much could go wrong. Let me know, though.\r\n\r\nLegal:\r\nWho cares?",
