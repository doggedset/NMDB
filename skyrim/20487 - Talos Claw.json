  "descriptionHtml": "Ok so first off I have been moding for myself for many years now, but this is the first mod I have uploded. I just felt it was time to start sharing! :) But enough about me.\r\n\r\nI wanted to make a large Holy Sword, and that\\'s what this is. Right now it is one handed, but in time I think I may add a two handed version.\r\n\r\nIts in Sky Haven Temple next to Dragonsbane \r\n\r\nAnyway I hope you guys like it!\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks to:\r\n\r\nBethesda: For making an amazing game, and making it so easy to mod it!\r\n\r\nThe Nexus: For giving all us moders a place to share our mods, and our ideas!\r\n\r\nKalten1979: For making an awesome mod, and letting me use part of it! Thanks man!",
