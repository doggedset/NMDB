It\\'s essentially a large, Nordic ruin-esque room to try out and review new mods, from weapons to spells to npcs. Hope you enjoy it!\r\nAs this is my first mod, please excuse any choppy animations in the walls, etc. I hope to release an update soon to remedy that. \r\nHOW TO USE IT: In a normal game, type \\\"coc TestingArena\\\" into the console and you will be teleported there. I recommend making a save before, as anything might happen, ya never know... :D",
