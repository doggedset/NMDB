You also need to have [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/]every DLC in the game[/url] and additional utility mods such as [url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE [/url]and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863/?]SkyUI[/url]. In addition to utility mods, its recommended that you play [i]Dominion[/i] on a Windows 7, 8.1, or 10 gaming desktop or laptop with an NVIDIA graphics card or similar. Intel graphic cards and low-end non-gaming pcs and laptops could constantly crash [i]Dominion[/i] and ruin gaming performance.

Other mods have a possibility of conflicting with [i]Dominion[/i] and can thus ruin your experience.\r<br />\r<br />After creating and naming your character, go to the Statue of Mara and activate it. Choose the &#34;Start Dominion&#34; option and go to the bed. When in the bed, you will then be transported to the Summerset Isles where the Dominion Main Storyline begins.\r<br />\r<br />IMPORTANT NOTE: Do NOT use console to set stages, open doors, or disabled objects&#33;&#33;&#33; This mod has been rigorously tested and nothing should be broken, so by doing this you void any hope for support, and will most likely break stuff, if not the whole standalone expansion pack itself.[/font]\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][font=Georgia][center]How to Uninstall [i]Dominion?[/i][/center][/font][/size][font=Tahoma]The uninstalling of [i]Dominion[/i] mid-game is NOT supported at all. [i]Dominion[/i] is simply too big of a mod. Treat [i]Dominion[/i] like a DLC or standalone title, and DO NOT remove it during a playthrough. Only remove [i]Dominion[/i] if you have beat the DLC-mod and are tired of it, or if you just wish to start a new game without [i]Dominion[/i] or its modified Life Another Life Mod. If you do want to play [i]The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim[/i] without uninstalling Dominion, simply start a new game and go to the statue and select &#34;Start Skyrim&#34; instead of &#34;Start Dominion&#34;.[/font]",
