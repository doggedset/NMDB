  "descriptionHtml": "Ever gone through a dungeon with infinite paralysis poisons? Did you yawn too?\r\nEver use an endless loop of fortify professions? Yeah, it sounds fun, but I found that it gets old fast.\r\n\r\nAt first I decided to just ignore the potions whenever I found them.\r\nThen one day, I see a black potions across the room. What\\'s that?! Oh.. paralysis.\r\nThen I see a locked chest and find the right position for my lock to open it. Great.. just another fortify enchanting elixir.\r\nOn top of that, it spoiled the fun of alchemy, too. There would be spell effects for an ingredient that I am eager to discover, but of course it is just one of those..\r\n\r\nWould they please go away?  Yes\r\n\r\nThis mod removes paralysis, fortify smithing, and fortify enchanting effects from potions and ingredients.\r\n\r\nYou might also like:\r\n\r\nImproved Armor Formula\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15860\r\nImproved Ammo Weight\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14389",
