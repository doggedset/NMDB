  "summary": "This will allow you to move the files in your Skyrim install.  If you move the bsa files, textures folder, ect to other hard drives it will help with stuttering.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I wasn\\'t having as much stutter as other people have but it would if I turned around fast.  I know that the hard drive is a bottle neck but you can\\'t re-direct where the files are stored in the skyrim.ini since it won\\'t work.  I did some searching and found a program that makes it easy to create symbolic links to your files and folders.\r\n\r\nSymbolic links are like desktop shortcuts but are recognized as the files/folders you are linking to.\r\n\r\nLink Shell Extension is a Windows Explorer extension that puts an option in your right-click menu to create these links.  There is more then just symbolic links included but the others are not needed.\r\n\r\nWhat I did was split the bsa files across my 3 hard drives separating the meshes and textures.  I then took some of the folders in the textures folder and moved them to the drive with the meshes bsa file.\r\n\r\nYou can find more info about Link Shell Extension at http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/hardlinkshellext.html along with specific instructions on it\\'s usage and a download.",
