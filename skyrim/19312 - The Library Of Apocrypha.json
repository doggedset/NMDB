  "descriptionHtml": "----------------------------------------------------------\r<br />The Library Of Apocrypha\r<br />----------------------------------------------------------\r<br /> \r<br />Visit Hermaeus Mora&#39;s sphere of Oblivion, known as Apocrypha.  Here, the ghosts of scholars haunt a giant library of arcane knowledge, forever trying to understand the secrets of the universe.\r<br />\r<br />Get there by reading a mysterious black book found in the College of Winterhold&#39;s Arcaneum.  To get back, you&#39;ll have to find the other magical book--not such an easy task when every single book in the library has the same black binding&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />----------------------------------------------------------\r<br />Notes\r<br />----------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />This mod could be considered a cheat due to how easy it becomes to read many, many skill books.  Also, the books are free for the taking.  It is up to the player to show restraint in these aspects.\r<br />\r<br />Turning on the quest marker might help you find your way out if you&#39;re really lost, but in the maze of rooms in the library, it could also lead you astray.\r<br />\r<br />Due to the large number of books that this mod will load, performance may suffer on lower end machines.\r<br />\r<br />All books look identical on the bookshelves, but if you take one, it will look normal in your inventory.\r<br />\r<br />And yes, the glowing red letters spell out real words. :-)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />----------------------------------------------------------\r<br />Credits\r<br />----------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />This mod was created by Deandra at the UESP (username Merilia at TESNexus since the name Deandra was taken). No permission is required for you to use the items I created in your own modding work, but please give credit as appropriate.  If you want to reuse the robes that some of the ghosts are wearing, ask me for a higher resolution version that also includes 1st person models (I shrank it down a lot because this mod was starting to take up a lot of space).",
