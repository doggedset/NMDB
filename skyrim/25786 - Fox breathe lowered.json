  "summary": "Better fox breathe pitch and volume. Original was identical to wolves.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a small mod to improve the fox breathe volume and pitch to NOT match the same sound used also for wolves as the vanilla game does.\r\nNow you can distinguish wolves or foxes by their different breath!\r\n\r\n[B]It\\'s not a new sample[/B], I\\'ve just edited the sound properties with Creation Kit.\r\nThis mod is 100% compatible with any other mod around I know of (also those that modify animals, but usually never change their default sounds).\r\n\r\nThat\\'s it.",
