  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#313131].[/color][size=3]\n<br />[/size][center][size=3]\n<br />[color=DeepSkyBlue][b]Gourd Ingredient[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This mod replaces Skyrim's Gourd with an ingredient version.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />A simple hidden perk will silently exchange the food version of the Gourd\n<br />for the new ingredient version when it is picked up by the player.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />I have given the Gourd ingredient two effects which seemed to be already justified by the game (based on\n<br />what it did as a food, and what an in-game recipe suggests it should do as in ingredient), and I've given it two\n<br />other effects that seemed appropriate to me. If you want the full effect list spoiler, click the readme tab above.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Although the mod [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19204]Gourds as Ingredients[/url] has been around for some time, that mod has some\n<br />very undesirable side-effects because it directly edits every cell in the game that has a Gourd in it.\n<br />This version doesn't edit any vanilla Skyrim assets, not even the original Gourd. So it should be totally\n<br />compatible with anything, and it should work very easily without any overhead or anything like that.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />To uninstall, just remove the file.\n<br />\n<br />~ Enjoy ~\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[/center]\n<br />[color=#313131].[/color]",
