  "descriptionHtml": "The Dark Brotherhood finally did something good for once. The Evil Voices of 1D have forever been locked in the dungeons of Dawnstar Santcuary. As the Listener of the dark brotherhood, you have the right to inflict as much pain as possible. Also, they aged a bit because they are in the torture chamber. \r<br />\r<br />I made this as a fuck around mod, and please don&#39;t think that I want to lock One Direction in my basement, but if you hate them as much as I do, feel free to have fun with this mod.\r<br />\r<br />This only changes the looks of the torture victims, not the voice. This is to ensure functionality. ",
