  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is quite simple, for it is my first mod. This mod adds an NPC called Connor The Destroyer, and he is my substitute for the Ebony Warrior. If you don&#39;t own any DLC or you aren&#39;t level 80 yet, this mod is perfect for you. Connor can be located right outside of The Abandoned Shack that starts off the Dark Brotherhood quest. He will instantly start to fight you once in close proximity; and won&#39;t stop until one side perishes. \r<br />\r<br />Born in the flames of Oblivion, Connor was found near Dawnstar as a baby. He was raised by 2 Nords and had a normal childhood. Connor was then taken away by his rightful Daedra parents and began training in the ways of a Dremora at age 11. Something happened during his time with Nords though: he was changed into a Nord. The Daedra didn&#39;t care, and continued on with his training. At age 35, Connor was the most powerful Nord in the planes of Oblivion, and was given his first tasks in Tamriel: Destroy the DragonBorn. Connor was then instantly sent to multiple places to find the Dragonborn, but couldn&#39;t fid him. But one day after walking in the swamps of Morthal, he had found the Dragonborn&#33;\r<br />\r<br />More intricate and cooler mods are on the way, so stay tuned&#33;",
