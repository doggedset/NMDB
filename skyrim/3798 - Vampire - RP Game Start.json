  "descriptionHtml": "STORY>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\nShe awoke thirsty.  So thirsty.  Opening her eyes slowly, the ambient flickering light nearly struck her like a blow.  She flinched, one hand cupping her aching head and the other seeking outward and finding corroded and sticky metal.  Lifting her hand to block the light, her eyes opened once more and she could see that her hand was covered in something dark that smelled of corruption.  Blood maybe?  A cage, she thought to herself, as she slowly acclimated to the light.  I\\'m in a cage?  Blinking a few times, her eyes sought something familiar, anything that would help her remember how she\\'d ended up in this misbegotten place.  A rustling sound came from near the shadowed entry of what appeared to be a cave.  She called out once, twice... no response was given.  She shivered reflexively and wrapped her arms around herself, ignoring the sticky smears and the layers of dirt ground into the fiber of her meager clothing. \r\n \r\nIt was bad enough she was \\\"captured\\\" by her own people the Imperials, upon arrival in Skyrim and that she nearly lost her head for no reason other than being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  It was certainly unbelieveable that what saved her was the timely arrival of a dragon (a dragon!) and the destruction of Helgen.  But to wake in this dank cave, filthy, stinking, cold and so very thirsty... Things may have gone from bad to worse but she wasn\\'t going to die like some trapped animal.  Rummaging around the floor of the cage she found a few bits of metal that had come loose from the cage.  With a sharp eye toward the lock, she\\'d attempt her escape.  And maybe find something to drink.\r\n\r\nDETAILS>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\n\r\nLevel 1, No cheats. You start with only a couple lockpicks and the rags on your back. Locked in a cage and infected with Sanguinare Vampiris. You are in the vampire faction, but have not turned. you have three days before becoming a stage 1 vampire. You are in Broken Fang Cave and that is the only location on your map. You know you are supposed to go to Riverwood but have no idea how to get there. Make your way free and find your cure, or make it your home and become a creature of the night. Its all up to you.\r\n\r\nI had to do this as a save game, but when the CK comes out I will be working on a true vampire mod, with vampy quests and story line.\r\n\r\n>>>>>> Added a male version! <<<<<<<<<<\r\n\r\n>>>>>> V2 - Uploaded 2 New Files, Male and Female with magicka regen fixed <<<<<<<",
