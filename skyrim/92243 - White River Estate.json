  "descriptionHtml": "A huge estate on the road to Whiterun. Set high up on a cliff with beautiful views, tons of storage and room for plenty of followers and children.\n<br />\n<br />The player has their own bedroom, while children and followers will sleep and hang out in the manor house. With an extensive kitchen and alchemy area just below, and a cave deep under the ground, making use of the natural lava flows for a blacksmithing and crafting cave. The mod also features a huge bathhouse and sauna, with water being heated by the lava flows under the mountain. Of course, the mod also includes a secret library and museum for all of the Dragonborn's treasures and displays.\n<br />\n<br />And, what's a Fera's mod without custom textures! Goats, horses, chickens, cows and more are unique and have custom textures.",
