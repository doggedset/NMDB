  "descriptionHtml": "Project: Whiterun Starter Home\r\nAuthor: Princess Stomper\r\nVersion: 1.0\r\nRelease Date: 09/11/2013\r\nCategory: Houses\r\nWebsite(s): Steam, Nexus\r\n\r\n==================\r\nRequirements:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nSkryim, Hearthfire DLC\r\n\r\n==================\r\nDescription:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nAdds a small shack called Plains View Cottage to the poorer district of Whiterun. No barrier to ownership - just walk on in. \r\n\r\n==================\r\nDetails:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nUpstairs: \r\n- Hallway (+ weapons storage)\r\n- Bathroom (bath, sink, toilet)\r\n\r\nDownstairs: \r\n- Kitchen-dining area (Hearthfire oven and food)\r\n- Lounge area (sofa-benches, bookcase, alchemy/enchanting)\r\n- Sleeping area (2x double beds)\r\n\r\nCredits for Resources used:\r\n\r\nFilled bookshelves (set up as containers): Lilith & InsanitySorrow\r\nFilled washbasins: Lilith & InsanitySorrow\r\n\r\nToilet: Runscorn\r\n\r\n==================\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n==================\r\n\r\n- The house is equipped with a \"child bed\" but there don't seem to be any instructions on how to make the house child-friendly. It should be fine if you're using a modder-made child companion that doesn't rely on scripts counting Breezhome etc as \"home\".\r\n\r\n- Alternatively, if you're braver than me, you could try Marry and Companion Free (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2176/?) to persuade the kid to follow you to the new building, but I wouldn't like to guess what that would do to their scripts.\r\n\r\n- The alchemy and enchanting labs are scaled down to fit, which will lead to 3rd person animation weirdness when you're using them. I don't mind that, and hopefully you won't either: it's just the visual distorting effects of magic, after all.\r\n\r\n- Most of the storage in the house is unconventional, so look closely - e.g. the \"potion\" is actually a container for potions.\r\n\r\n==================\r\nLicensing/Legal:\r\n==================\r\n\r\nCredit for my work would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nDo NOT include any part of this mod, including assets, in any project that is asking for or allows donations.",
