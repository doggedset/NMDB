  "descriptionHtml": "I loved the Basic Human Needs - Food Drink and Sleep by Andrewpk, but felt the bottles were too heavy.\r\nA full water bottle weights 10, while a full liquor bottle weights 0.5\r\n\r\nSo I changed only the bottles\\' weight, and repacked everything, so the original mod won\\'t be necessary.\r\n\r\nFull Bottle from 10 to 0.5\r\nAlmost Full Bottle from 6.6 to 0.4\r\nAlmost Empty Bottle from 3.3 to 0.2\r\nEmpty Bottle from 1 to 0.1\r\n\r\nAll credit goes to Andrewpk for his amazing mod!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
