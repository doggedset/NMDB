  "descriptionHtml": "This is my very first mod I have made, it is a Bosmer male follower and spouse.  I was really annoyed there are no bosmer marryable NPCs, and I wasn&#39;t very pleased with other mods I found, I wanted a &#34;classic&#34; looking bosmer. I wanted to share him with other players who search for this kind of NPC, and I really hope it works&#33; If it&#39;s something wrong please let me know&#33; I am a noob&#33; xD \r<br />Faeranduil has a preset  dunHunterFroki outfit,  and also in his inventory has an Ebony armor, a soul trap dwarven longsword, a fire daedric bow and hunting bow. Has a minimul level of 20 and a max of 50. He also levels with the player. He is Agressive, Foolhardy, morality-any crime and combat stile is HumanMissile. His voice is MaleEvenToned.\r<br />I used ApachiiHair, ApachiiHair for Males( link http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?) for his hair- I think is ElfHair 29(I think it needs both mods to work, but I&#39;m not sure).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s not much, mainly he was made for fun&#33;",
