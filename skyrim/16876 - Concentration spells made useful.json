  "descriptionHtml": "This is just a few changed spells to offer new powers and costs of the concentration spells - its a tiny mod that I thought I would upload because I didn\\'t see one already posted. \r\n\r\nI personally like the concentration spells but their power is made obsolete very quickly, this is my attempt to make them more usable (keep in mind it took about 2 hours and isn\\'t a master work or re texture) - I may be able to make other versions but for now its just the one.\r\n\r\nThere are 6 spells now, 2 of each type of concentration spell, one does 30dps and the other does 60 dps. They have a reasonable cost of magicka if you have problems with the cost you should look into enchanting, as you can reduce any destruction cost by 100% with the know how \r\n\r\nYou find the spell tomes just in Riverwood along the first wall you normally come to, the pictures show where better then I can explain - that\\'s the only copy in the game you wont find anyone else with the spell.",
