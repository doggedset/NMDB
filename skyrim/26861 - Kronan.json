  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][u]DISCONTINUED[/u]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />Back in early 2013 life took a giant shit on me, And to make it a little bit worse my hardrive was damaged so I lost a substantial update I was about to release. After that debacle I just lost the will to pick up the slack and start over again so I&#39;ve decided allow my mod to be used in others instead.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />What it does? you get your own ship called kronan with a custom made interior of Katariah architecture so its not a copy and paste job. This mod is Beta stage right now, I only wanted to show you what i have done so far. The ship is located near the port of Solitude\r<br />\r<br />I still need to create: done with cluttering and navmeshing, im still a noob when i comes to AI packages and optimization, this mod will likely be finished early next year.",
