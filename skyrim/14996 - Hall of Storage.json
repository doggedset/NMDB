  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a Hall of Storage to the Western Watchtower.\r\nIt has storage for all the items you may pick up on your travels.\r\n\r\nArmor (standard, enchanted and unique).\r\nWeapons (standard, enchanted and unique).\r\nClothing (standard, enchanted and unique).\r\nJewelry (standard, enchanted and unique)\r\nStaves (standard and unique).\r\nDragon and Masks.\r\nArrows.\r\nGems and Soul Gems.\r\nSpell Tomes, Scrolls, Books and Notes.\r\nFood and Drink.\r\nIngredients, Potions and Poisons.\r\nCrafting, Other and Special.\r\n\r\nAnd a bed.\r\n\r\nAll crafting stations are available, as well as 9 mannequins, 6 weapon racks and 5 weapon plaques.\r\n\r\nI made this for me because I hoard everything and trying to sift through hundreds of item in one chest became too hard, and trying to remember which chest contained what was again too hard.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion History:\r\n\r\n1.0 - Added most chests and a bed.\r\n1.1 - Added more chests (Jewelry, Dragon and Masks), mannequins and crafting stations.\r\n1.15 - Fixed the \\'jewlery\\' mistake.\r\n1.16 - Fixed the second \\'jewelery\\' mistake (why can\\'t I spell?). Fixed the alignment for the cooking pot.\r\n2.0 - Previous jewelry chests have been removed and replaced. Cooking pot has been replaced with a pot and spit over a fire. Added weapon racks and plaques to the mannequin corridor. This version also has added support for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9555]Western Watchtower Rebuilt[/url].\r\n\r\nFuture Versions:\r\n\r\nAdd bookshelves(!).\r\nA training room that allows you to \\'summon\\' skeletons/draugr/bandits (or some such) to battle with and train offensive and defensive skills with/on (hopefully not a spell/power, but we\\'ll see).\r\n\r\nIf you would prefer to use the Steam Workshop then here you go: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=21352]Hall of Storage[/url]",
