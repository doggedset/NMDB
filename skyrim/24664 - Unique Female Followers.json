  "descriptionHtml": "[color=yellow][b][center]Update Status[/center][/b][/color]\r\nElorwen has been taken down as the required mod for her is no longer available. I\\'m so sorry for this, but it was the only way I could share her with you folks. Thanks so much everyone for supporting this mod.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF00][b]Please read the Known Issues and FAQ before asking questions.[/b][/color]\r\n[b]Contents:[/b]\r\nKnown Issues\r\nFAQ\r\nVideos\r\nCredits\r\nAuthor\\'s Note\r\nSpecial Thanks\r\n\r\n[color=red][center]Known Issues:[/center][/color]\r\n[b][color=red]Rainbow or pitch black body, hands, or face[/color][/b] (thanks to 4GVN for this explanation taken from the comments section):\r\nI\\'m going to paraphrase, but it appears that users with older PCs may be experiencing crashes when entering The Bannered Mare or these texture bugs due to memory issues. The followers are using high res textures from the mods I listed below as is (so in most cases, uncompressed), so sometimes when they fail to load due to memory issues, they will appear as rainbow or pitch black.\r\n[b][u]Confirmed fixes include:[/b][/u]\r\nEnter an interior cell, sometimes entering and exiting more than once to make the texture load properly (this is for the random occasional glitch, not persistent rainbow/black issues).\r\nDownload the All-in-One Compressed Texture Pack that I have uploaded using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12801]Optimizer Textures by AdPipino[/url] (Miria face fix available separately under optional files as well)\r\nMake sure you are running the latest version of Skyrim 1.7.7.0.6\r\nMake sure you are running the latest UFO (Read his notes and fixes regarding the 1.7 Skyrim patch that bugs custom dialogue)\r\nSet your texture settings to high (this is not required if you download the Compressed Texture Pack)\r\n\r\n[color=red][b]Followers aren\\'t in the specified locations:[/b][/color]\r\nTry making sure the mod is running by opening console and typing Help Vyliana (or any of the follower names). If nothing comes up, the mod is not installed or activated. If the mod is installed (something does come up), make sure that Skyrim and UFO are both the latest versions. If they are, then try the Compressed Texture Pack.\r\n\r\n[color=red][b]Crashing when entering The Bannered Mare:[/b][/color]\r\nThe Bannered Mare might be too crowded for your system to load everything. Download the UFF Location Patch and it will move Vyliana to The Drunken Huntsman and Tresa to Jorrvaskr. They\\'re all still in Whiterun but hopefully splitting them will allow you to enter The Bannered Mare without issues.\r\n\r\nThanks to all the users that have been trying to help me resolve issues that others are having with the texture issue, and thanks to all that take the time to report their issues and their findings. Your continued participation is what makes it all worth it. Thank you so much.\r\n\r\nIf you want more than one character to follow you at a time, or if you want to remove the default gear on characters, I recommend downloading and installing [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037]UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul[/url]. It must be [u]above this mod[/u] to work properly.\r\n\r\n[center][color=#87CEEB]FAQ[/color][/center]\r\n[color=#87CEEB]What is this mod?[/color]\r\nThis mod adds 11 female companions to the game. They look just like the screenshots, no other mods required. They come with armor, but not the clothing in the title image (I have taken liberties with the title image, the info for the clothing is just below). The only follower that requires another mod is Elorwen due to the special permission I was granted to share her. Please see below.\r\n\r\n[color=#87CEEB]What clothing is worn in the title image?[/color]\r\nFrom left to right: Lady of Death (included in this mod), Osare Maid, Temptress Shirt/Shorts, Vicky Bra alt/Dragons Crown Sorceress thong, Khantu Shirt alt/Khantu Panties, Skimpy Assassin (not on Nexus), La Mer (not on Nexus), Diano UNPB, Caliburn, Salome Dress CBBE (google)\r\n\r\n[color=#87CEEB]Why is the armor so strong?[/color]\r\nI want these characters to be able to hold up in the late game, and for people who might be starting over, this can be used to give you an extra boost if you\\'re tired of having to build up during the early game. If you don\\'t want to use the armor, use UFO to remove the default gear and use any armor you like (this is my preferred solution to every user anyway as I encourage you to use what you like). This mod was designed with UFO in mind as I didn\\'t merge nine followers into one esp so that only one would follow you at a time.\r\n\r\n[color=#87CEEB]Can I enchant or upgrade the armor?[/color]\r\nAll of it is enchantable, and the piercings are enchantable as jewelry. You cannot temper the armor. Since it\\'s already much stronger than the default vanilla gear from which it is based, you can just consider it pre-upgraded for you. :)\r\n\r\n[color=#87CEEB]Where is the armor from?[/color]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18008]Ashara Princess of the Woods for UNP by SydneyB[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13004]Remodeled Armor CBBEv3M by MAK[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19772]Remodeled Armors - UNP version - Originally by Mak07 for CBBEv3M by asianboy345[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13761]Lady of Death by newermind43[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22023]TERA Armors for Skyrim - UNP by Silver0236 and asianboy345[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23334]Dark Lillith for UNPB-BBP by selobl - also Hentai/Zotman12 and Calyps[/url]\r\n\r\n[color=#87CEEB]Will you ever merge any other followers into the all-in-one?[/color]\r\nNo, the all-in-one pack contains all characters from my original vision of this mod (excluding Miria and Elorwen for reasons stated below). Any new characters will be separate downloads.\r\n\r\n[color=#87CEEB]Will you ever separate characters?[/color]\r\nNo, most users have asked that all characters be merged. Now that they are all merged, people are asking me to separate them into single character downloads. It was a lot of work to make the all-in-one, and I\\'m not about to undo it for any reason. If you want to delete characters yourself in the CK, I encourage you to modify it on your own.\r\n\r\n[color=#87CEEB]Why is the game lagging when I have everyone following me?[/color]\r\nThere are a lot of high res textures being used by each character, many of them different (unlike vanilla NPCs that all use the exact same textures). Unless you have a beast computer or turn down your ENB settings, you can try limiting your group size to maybe 4 or 5 followers, or download the Compressed Texture Pack under optional files. I tried bringing all 11 characters with the ENB settings you see in the screens and it slowed me down to 10 frames or less. Good news is that the followers can destroy everything for you if you bring that many.\r\n\r\n[color=#87CEEB]Where are the followers located?[/color]\r\nPlease check the screenshots, especially the faces with the text in the bottom right corner. Miria starts in The Sleeping Giant Inn but will come find you instead.\r\n\r\n[color=#87CEEB]How does Miria heal my party?[/color]\r\nThe healing part of this character is based on gilgoon\\'s SooJi companion; I basically duplicated what he did in the CK. I am not a scripter so there is little chance that this will change. She will act in the exact same manner as SooJi, meaning that she will follow you around and assist and heal you without being an actual follower. If you make her your follower, she will not be able to heal you. Make her your follower if you want her to wait somewhere or equip her. Dismissing her will make her follow you again without being a follower so that heal spells will work again. Due to the nature of her healing making her a pseudo-follower, I have decided to keep her separate from the merged pack.\r\n\r\n[color=#87CEEB]What perks do each follower have?[/color]\r\nThe list is way too long, and most people don\\'t even read this far down the description. Suffice to say that they should all make sense within the context of the character (the starting equipment is a good hint at how each character fights). Dreya has stealth/assassination and dual wield perks for her dual daggers; Irina has destruction/fire perks for her fire spells, and a couple 1H perks for her sword; Vyliana and Miria have many archery perks (Vyliana has more stealth and deadly shot related perks while Miria has some healing perks instead); Tresa has many 2H perks that include extra power attacks (Vyrana has some as well but they are different in that Tresa focuses more on damage and AoE with sweep while Vyrana focuses on crit and has Warmaster); Caitriona has some 1H perks and most Block/Shield Bash perks. The list goes on, but you can view for yourself in the CK, or just trust that these characters should be able to hold their own with you in almost any siutation.\r\n\r\n[color=#87CEEB]I like ___ follower. How can I get my character to look like her?[/color]\r\nPlease scroll down past the videos to the credits and find the character to see which mods were used for what part. I spent a lot of time making this credits section to hopefully help you guys identify exactly what was used, because each author of every mod that I used deserves it. I hope it helps everyone.\r\n\r\n[color=#87CEEB]Who is Lilith?[/color]\r\nLilith is a special request from Raulito and his [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21715]mod here[/url]. This was going to be the first of possibly a series of requests, but due to RL taking over my modding time, I\\'m not taking any more requests until further notice. She can be found in the Sleeping Giant Inn and is a Nightblade with one-hand sword, destruction, light armor, and sneak perks. She comes with her own armor and a silver sword and knows the flames spell. For information regarding her appearance, as always, check the credits section below. Raulito has also prepared a special backstory regarding Lilith\\'s origin. I have added it under the Readme button above (the button with the exclamation mark \\\"!\\\"). Please check it out!\r\n\r\n[center][color=gold][b]Thanks to MXR (MMOxReview) for reviewing my mod![/b][/color][/center]\r\n[center][youtube]NyFQieYerkM[/youtube][/center]\r\n[center]Thanks to hodilton and olivierhacking for the videos![/center]\r\n[youtube]B6hyQ_xMtDw[/youtube][youtube]BiCelNIPiI8[/youtube]\r\n\r\n[center][b][color=green]Credits[/color][/b][/center]\r\nCaitriona (Imperial)\r\nFace: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666]CBBE Face[/url] (Caliente)\r\nEyes: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722]The Eyes of Beauty[/url] (LogRaam)\r\nHair: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7403]Lovely Hairstyles[/url] (sn00p / zn00p)\r\nBrow: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666]Darker Neater Brows[/url] (Caliente)\r\nPaint: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21121]Face Warpaint Replacer[/url] (kenokun)\r\nScar: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4784]High Resolution Scars[/url] (Xenius)\r\nBody: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709]UNP[/url] (dimon99)\r\nSkin: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6554]CBBE skin texture V2 V3 plus Thepal and UNP compatible[/url] (navetsea)\r\nMuscle: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16731]UNP Fitness Body -

If I have missed anyone\\'s work, please PM me and I will either credit you, or remove your work from the file (if it is your wish). Also, if you see your work here and you do not remember giving me permission, please check your PMs first: I sent every author a PM asking for permission. If I misunderstood your permissions note, please give me the benefit of the doubt and contact me first. I spent weeks trying to contact every author after this mod was finished to make sure this mod is respectful to the works of other authors. Thanks to all of the original authors for the assets I used.\r\n\r\nThis mod wasn\\'t meant to make it so that users do not download any of the original files I have listed. In fact, this mod is more of a celebration of the amazing mods that authors have created over the many months Skyrim has been out. Without their work, this mod doesn\\'t exist. I hope this mod either convinces a user to try something new, or at least be made aware that many other mods exist to further enhance the looks of your characters.
