  "descriptionHtml": "BETTER TRAINING FOR OBLIVION: http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/43235\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple mod that still makes the game that much better.\r\nWhat Better Training does is make it so that you can train 10,000 times per level instead of 5--because if you have the gold, why not?  Morrowind\\'s training system was best (unlimited training), and this mod aims to achieve that--it practically has.  Since you will no doubt level up before you have the gold to train 10,00 times, it is in essence unlimited training.  \r\n\r\nYou can use this, but please give me credit and NOTIFY ME in a message.\r\n\r\nThis mod is also on Steam.  Just type in Better Training in the workshop search bar.",
