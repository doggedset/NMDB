This mod uses Elys (Community) Uncapper mod, with my own settings. (200 SKILL CAP)\r\nFor those who want a more long gameplay with a harder difficulty, I\\'ll reccommend this. Use this with [b]Deadly Dragons, Wars in Skyrim and Custom Difficulty mods, now there should be a balance.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]What it does:[/b] This mod adds twice as much perks to six warrior skill trees: Two-Handed, One-Handed, Archery, Heavy Armor, Block and Smithing.\r\n\r\nI want to list all of new new added perks but it is a tiring work so I\\'ll explain what kinds of perks that I added.\r\n\r\n[b]EXAMPLE:[/b] For example; in vanilla there are 5 ransk of damage increasing perks in Twohanded skill tree. Each one has a skill requirement, like 0, 20, 40, 60, 80\r\nNow I added more 5 perks to this damage increasing perks so you can improve your attack skill more: requires 100, 120, 140,160, 180 skill\r\n\r\n[b]Another example:[/b] Bullseye (15% chance of paralyzing for 10 seconds with bow) perk needs a 100 Archery skill points, now i added a new rank to Bullseye (30% chance of paralyzing for 20 seconds) that requires 200 archery skill points.\r\n\r\n[b]As for smithing:[/b] Now all smithing perks has one more rank, like 1st rank, as in vanilla, unlocks a new armor-weapon set to create and improve them twice as much at forges, now with second rank: you can improve those armor-weapons 4x as much! Especially, this is for those who want to use low-level armor-weapon set for liking his appearance. (Notice the 200 skill cap, this will affect your smithing also)\r\n\r\nYou\\'ll see all new perks with their descriptions in game, already.\r\n\r\n[b]Installation:[/b]\r\nJust extract all .esp files or what you want, to your Data folder. And copy SKSE folder to your Data folder.\r\n\r\n[b][color=red]FOR FRENCH VERSION ADDED, LOOK FOR DOWNLOADS SECTION, THANKS TO XENICLE:[/color][/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Note:[/b] Just let me know if you find bugs.",
