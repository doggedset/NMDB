  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ffff00][size=6]Riverwood Shack[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Version: 1.1 EVU\r<br />By: Mechwarrior94 (Jarno Moleveld)\r<br />Mod Type: Player Home\r<br />\r<br />This mod is meant as starter player home. The size of this small house is done on purpose there for.\r<br />Also the storage space and all that usually comes is very limited. Also this is done on purpose&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This mod does require some work for the player&#33; You are required to find the key yourself&#33; I will NOT give any hints, you should be able to find those by reading the journal within the game. \r<br />\r<br />Exterior changes to the vanilla game are some added structures within Riverwood and some other things that make it look a little better. Also you will find now a smelter so that you won&#39;t have to hop around as much as with the vanilla game. The interior however is a new cell and has not much space. You will find a double bed, 6 containers to store your stuff in. Also you will find 2 mannequin&#39;s and 1 weapon display and a weapon rack. You can cook inside, but everything else you need to do with the vanilla work stations. This also is done on purpose so that it is not over powered at all. This mod should be perfect if you desire a smaller house then the vanilla houses or most of the other mods give you.\r<br />\r<br />[b][i][u][color=#e69138]Please do not forget to endorse the file, it really helps out a lot&#33; :D[/color][/u][/i][/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4]Version 1.1 EVU:[/size][/color]\r<br />[size=1](Exterior Visual Update)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />This update aims to improve the exterior mostly with few interior updates.\r<br />Changes Exterior:\r<br />\r<br />- Cart is has food on it now\r<br />- Place where the tower was is changed a lot, the ground it was on is now more flat. The tower is moved more towards the bridge.\r<br />- Smelter is now between the house and the tower\r<br />- 2 Chickens and 2 nests added\r<br />- Exterior lighting changed a bit to suit the new exterior look better + better balanced\r<br />- House exterior itself changed slightly\r<br />- Exterior has slightly more clutter laying around now\r<br />- Large tree has been moved to the small island (sawmill island)\r<br />- Removed the vanilla stone walls\r<br />- Changed the land hight to suit the new exterior landscape better\r<br />- Exterior Nav Mesh fixed redone\r<br />\r<br />Hints towards real-life events: 1\r<br />(look around and you will find these, just like the vanilla game&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4]How to gain the key:[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />You should be able to follow the hints just like you would with the vanilla game.\r<br />Only difference is that you won&#39;t get a easy quest marker to find the key&#33;\r<br />You need to read the journal and follow the hints.\r<br />There are 2 keys for the same door that you can find within the game.\r<br />\r<br />Key 1: This okey is hard to find. Would be a ideal task for players who love to\r<br />search for things and take their time to do so&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Key 2: This key should be easy to find. Mostly for people who can&#39;t be bothered\r<br />to much to look for things.\r<br />\r<br />For easy travel, you may want to get the map marker first&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[i][color=#00ffff]NOTE: Please do NOT mention the location of either key in the chat or the comments&#33;\r<br />This will be removed&#33; If someone is too lazy to find even the second key,\r<br />it&#39;s their problem and not yours&#33; If you don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t play the game&#33;\r<br />Vanilla game is filled with puzzles&#33;[/color][/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4]Required:[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />- Skyrim (obviously)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4]Recommended:[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />- [size=2][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10652/?]Vanilla Mannequin Script Fix[/url][color=#ffd966] [/color](Should fix the wandering mannequin problem)[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4]Installation (Manual ONLY):[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />1. Unpack with 7zip\r<br />2. Copy the folder &#39;Data&#39; to your Skyrim main folder (or the contents to the Skyrim Data folder)\r<br />3. Make sure the mod is active in the load order\r<br />4. Run the game\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE INSTALLATION&#33;\r<br />Before you install the new version, please make sure you remove ALL content\r<br />that you placed inside the house and the chests. Then safe the game,\r<br />uninstall mod, safe your game without the mod installed and only then proceed\r<br />to install the game as normally. If you do not do this, you may end up loosing\r<br />your stuff or other weird problems may come up.\r<br />\r<br />[i][b][color=#ff0000]WARNING&#33;\r<br />You may want to check the location if it is the same as vanilla.\r<br />This location is also used by other player house mods&#33;\r<br />You may cause problems by installing multiple mods on the same location&#33;\r<br />It is between the blacksmith and the first stone bridge towards Whiterun.[/color][/b][/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4]Bugs:[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][color=#ff0000]Bug:[/color][/u][/b]\r<br />There seems to be a nav mesh issue if loaded with the Creation Kit.\r<br />This however should NOT cause problems with your gameplay at all.\r<br />[b][u][color=#00ff00]Solution:[/color][/u][/b]\r<br />Unknown, vanilla game issue\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][color=#ff0000]Bug:[/color][/u][/b]\r<br />There seems to be a issue with the mannequins, with repeated entre to the house\r<br />they get creepy and seem to have moved off their spot. I unfortunately do not\r<br />know what causes this or how to fix it. If I remember correctly, the vanilla\r<br />game has also this problem occasionally. It may be the cause of it.\r<br />[b][u][color=#00ff00]Solution:[/color][/u][/b]\r<br />It looks like this is a vanilla game bug and NOT related to this mod in any way.\r<br />you may want to try out this bug fix to solve the problem if you are getting\r<br />this same problem: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10652/?][color=#ffd966][size=2]Vanilla Mannequin Script Fix[/size][/color][/url]",
