  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Shockwolf\\'s Voluptuous Borgakh the Steel Heart.[/b]\r\n\r\nChief Larak was looking forward to his daughter Borgakh the Steel Heart coming of age, so that he could marry her off to another chief and receive a fair trade in her absence... hopefully for a better supply of ale.   However he now knows that dream is lost, as he watches as the Dovahkiin make his way out of Mor Khazgur with his daughter.   \r\n\r\nHe then mutters to himself:  \\\"Meh, I would never have been able to marry her off, anyway.  What Orc chief in their right mind would want to marry my Daughter?   She too damn ugly... like those humans.\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an improved Borgakh the Steel Heart companion.  She is one of Skyrim\\'s original Companion followers found in the Orc Stronghold of Mor Khazgur. With the help of Apachii\\'s SkyHair and Zalzama\\'s Amazing Smooth females face texture, I have given Borgakh a major makeover. I have also improved the some of the stats and behaviour of this character to my liking. It is necessary to have SkyHair and smooth females mod installed.  I have also used Acdales EyeCandy Body (ADEC) and Saviours Hide Armour in the screenshots (not included), which I also use and what gives Borgakh her Voluptuousness, but you can use whatever body you like with this.  Although I cannot guarantee that the head skin tone will match if you do not use the ADEC body.\r\n\r\nI have changed some of Borgakh\\'s vanilla behaviour characteristics.  Her fighting style I have changed from an Orc guard to an Assassin Missile style.  Her class skill weights are now focused on Two-Handed 3, Archery 2, Block 1, Light Armour 2 and Sneak 3.  Before she was focused on Heavy Armour and Sneak, which makes no sense to me.   She has also been made essential and I have increased her movement speed to help her keep up with the player.  \r\n\r\n[b]Installation:[/b]\r\n\r\n1. [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168]Download and install ApachiiSkyHair[/url]\r\n2. [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=140] Download and install Amazing Smooth Females Complete[/url].  If you plan on installing the ADEC body, then you will need to install this Smooth Females mod AFTER it, to help insure that the skin tones match.\r\n3. Then after downloading this mod as well, Unzip the file contents to steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\data\r\n4. Activate SW_ Borgakh.esm in the Nexus Mod Manager or the Skyrim Launcher.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Uninstall:[/b]\r\n\r\nSimply delete the SW_ Borgakh.esm from steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\data\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n[b]Recommended Mods:[/b] As used in the images of Borgakh and parts taken from to make this mod possible.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168]ApachiiSkyHair[/url] (NEEDED!)\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=140]Amazing Smooth Females Complete[/url] (NEEDED!)\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5390]Acdale EyeCandy Body[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7782]ADEC Armour and Clothing Complation[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]The Grey Face Bug[/b]\r\n\r\nProviding you have installed this mod correctly and used all of the recommended mods to accompany it, there should be no mismatch between this characters head and body colour.  I have also followed the necessary steps with the Creation Kit to eliminate the Grey Face Bug before releasing it to the public and I have tested it myself.  As you can see from the images provided the bug is not present for me when I am using them.   However on the off chance that the bug still affects you, there is a way you can attempt to fix it yourself.  [url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOXF89QtgYM]Here is a helpful video showing you how you can do this.[/url] Hopefully Bethesda will come up with a fix for this soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Credits/Thanks[/b]\r\n\r\nBethesda for Skyrim.\r\nApachii for the use of the hair from their SkyHair Mod.\r\nZalzama  for the Amazing Smooth females face texture used in this mod.\r\nAcdale for the use of their ADEC body and Armour in the images.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\nShockwolf\r\n",
