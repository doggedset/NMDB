  "descriptionHtml": "Do you like sweetrolls?\r<br />Are you a conjuration mage and don&#39;t want to use restoration or alchemy to heal yourself?\r<br />Are you tired of not being able to conjure up a sweetroll for the hold guards?\r<br />\r<br />If so this mod is for you&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Location: The tome is located to the left of Dragonreach. While going towards the stairs, instead of going inside walk up the hill to the left and it is sitting on a &#34;warm bed&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />Installation: Just drag and drop the esp. into your data folder and make sure the box is checked under data files.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstalling: Make sure the spell is unequipped from your hand before you uninstall&#33; Uncheck the box and then delete the esp. from your data folder.\r<br />\r<br />I will take suggestions and add to the mod. I am thinking for doing a conjure gold coins mod, but I want to make it some what balanced.\r<br />\r<br />New idea thanks to supporter, conjure cabbage&#33; Soon to come in next update&#33;",
