  "summary": "A small mod that changes the Dragon Priest Masks so it doesn\\'t show up on the character\\'s model.",
  "descriptionHtml": "While I absolutely adore the stats of Krosis for my archer character, I hate having to run around with it on when I\\'m looking for good screenshot opportunities, so I made this small mod to fix that problem.\r\n\r\nThis mod removes the HEAD attribute in the masks\\' data so you can wear it (and gain all bonuses from it) while keeping it invisible on your character model. This is not a cheat, as it still acts the same as armor, and is merely a cosmetic enhancement.\r\n\r\nTo install, simply unzip the file into your data folder and turn it on in your launcher.\r\n\r\nFor those of you wondering how it can be done (and it can work for other helms as well), simply open up the Creation Kit, browse to the armor section, find the helm you want to make invisible, double click the entry, and then de-highlight all parts from the Biped Object section EXCEPT Circlet.",
