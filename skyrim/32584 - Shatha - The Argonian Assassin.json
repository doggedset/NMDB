  "descriptionHtml": "This is a clone for a follower in my Argonian Mage Playthrough.\r\nAlot of my viewers asked for an Argonian Follower, and since Shatha from my \\\"other\\\" Let\\'s Play had been rather popular i decided to give it a try and create him as a follower.\r\n\r\nThe result is pretty nice, so i hope you all will enjoy :)\r\n\r\nShatha can be found in Riverwood in the Inn.\r\nHe is proficient in Daggers aswell as a bow, and comes with standard elven versions.\r\nIn my Let\\'s Play he became a member of the Dark Brotherhood, and thus he wears the Dark Brotherhood armor.\r\n\r\nFor any backstory i would refer people to go watch my Argonian Assassin Playthrough, it currently contains over 100 episodes spanning from when Skyrim was released until early January this year.\r\n\r\nShatha is fully compatible with U.F.O.\r\n\r\nI am not responsible for any errors that may happen after downloading this companion.",
