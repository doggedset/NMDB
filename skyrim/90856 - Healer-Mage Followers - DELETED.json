  "descriptionHtml": "A pair of healer-mage followers. Kira is An Ice Mage, Sacari is a Fire Mage. They are in the Sleeping Giant in River wood . This is my first mod ever, so any helpful hint's are appreciated. You will need Ponytail Hairstyles by Azaikiowa who graciously granted permission to use his hair.\n<br /> I highly recommend FollowerLivePackage as it gives you an insane amount of control over your followers.\n<br /> They will be nude when you meet them but will equip when recruited",
