The mod is being offered as is because I have no desire to alter it in any way. It is the one house out of all my house mods that I use every play through and I like it just the way it is. This version of Dusk&#39;s is unchanged from the last version that was available here.\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />==================\r<br />The latest version of Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />Description:\r<br />==================\r<br />Dusk&#39;s Cabin is a small home located near Whiterun. It is a one room cabin but it has everything you need for crafting, enchanting and alchemy. It is a great starter home or a home for someone that likes to play a character that leads a simpler life.\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />Details:\r<br />==================\r<br />The cabin has a bunk bed so it will sleep two.\r<br />\r<br />There is an outhouse built onto the back of the cabin and a wood chopping block there as well.\r<br />\r<br />The cabin interior has an &#39;outdoor&#39; look to it. You can see the sky through the slatted roof and pine needles drift in as well but it will never rain or snow inside.\r<br />\r<br />The house comes with a pet chicken. I originally had the chicken outside but the local wildlife kept killing it so I moved it indoors for protection. The hen seemed pretty happy inside so I left it there.\r<br />\r<br />The cabin interior and exterior have been fully NavMeshed.\r<br />\r<br />Cleaned with TES5Edit 3_0_30\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />Installation:\r<br />==================\r<br />Use NMM or manual installiation if you prefer.\r<br />\r<br />Manual Instructions\r<br />1) Extract the contents of the ZIP folder into your Data folder\r<br />2) Make sure the Dusk&#39;s Cabin.esp is checked in the Launcher\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />Un-Installation:\r<br />==================\r<br />Manual Instructions\r<br />1) Delete the files/folders associated with the mod\r<br />2) Uncheck the Dusk&#39;s Cabin.esp in the Launcher\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />Credits:\r<br />==================\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r<br />Thanks to InsanitySorrow for the ReadMe Generator this ReadMe is based on.\r<br />Thanks to bfadragon for Extra Foods\r<br />Thanks to Blary for Book Sets, Food Container, Open Books and Potion Shelf resources\r<br />Thanks to DarkRider for Stoneware resource\r<br />Thanks to InsanitySorrow for the Buildy Blocks, ClutterStuffs and Washing Stuff resources.\r<br />Thanks to Lilith for Baskets, Buttons, and Ready Clutter.7 resources.\r<br />Thanks to Merilia for Babettes Feast\r<br />Thanks to Oaristys and Tony67 for Resource Pack 1.7\r<br />Thanks to Stroti for the Rustic Furniture resources\r<br />A special thank you to Tamira for converting Stroti&#39;s items for Skyrim\r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />Tools Used:\r<br />==================\r<br />ReadMe Generator\r<br />Creation Kit\r<br />Nifskope",
