  "descriptionHtml": "The College of Winterhold was eerily quiet for my taste. This is just a very simple mod that allows music to play normally from within the College, (except Hall of Elements).\r\n\r\nMusic was activated in the following locations:\r\n\r\nArch-Mage Quarters\r\nHall of Attainment\r\nHall of Countenance\r\nCollege Arcanaeum\r\n\r\nHall of Elements was not toggled purposefully.\r\n\r\nThis mod should be 100% compatible with all your favourite sound/audio mods.\r\nJust to be sure of its activation, I would load it last of all audio mods.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
