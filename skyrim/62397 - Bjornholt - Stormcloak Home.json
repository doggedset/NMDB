  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://melaniematthews.me/Skyrim/Mods/Bjornholt/bjornholtlogo.png[/img][center][/center][size=3]\r<br />In Windhelm’s palace courtyard, there waits a little home for Ulfric’s star Stormcloak.\r<br />\r<br />The house is equipped with an alchemy lab, kitchen, and bed with Well Rested bonus. There are also shrines to Talos and Kynareth, and plenty of safe storage containers for your armour, weapons, and supplies. It’s also navmeshed so your followers can join you inside.\r<br />\r<br />Being a house for true Nords, there is also a basement workshop with a fully equipped forge and storage for all your bits.\r<br />\r<br />Bjornholt is located near the Palace of Kings courtyard - when you go past the inn and go through the gate, it is directly to your left. See the image below. There is no key required - just head on inside and see what awaits&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://melaniematthews.me/Skyrim/Mods/Bjornholt/BH.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://melaniematthews.me/Skyrim/Mods/Bjornholt/req.png[/img]\r<br />[size=3]\r<br />Bjornholt [u][b]REQUIRES ALL DLCs[/b][/u] to operate.\r<br />\r<br />The stairs to the entrance are a little funny, the wall next to them kind of has its own collision thing going on. But it’s only a little thing, followers can scale the stairs without any issues.\r<br />\r<br />Sorry, there is no enchanting table in this house. To me that kind of goes against the general Nord/Stormcloak theme. You will have to go to the market square for your enchanting needs. \r<br />\r<br />The house remains the same if the Imperials take over Windhelm. If you’re an Imperial dog, you can use the console to disable the Stormcloak/Talos motifs.\r<br />\r<br />Bjornholt is incompatible with any mod that alters this little nook in Windhelm, pictured below. Otherwise, you should be ok.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://melaniematthews.me/Skyrim/Mods/Bjornholt/bhhelp.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />I’m planning on making some more homes in the future.
