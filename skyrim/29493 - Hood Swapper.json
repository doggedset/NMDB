  "summary": "Turn hooded robes into unhooded ones and vice versa at any tanning rack. Also fixes enchantment on unhooded Archmage\\'s Robes.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Ever looted a set of robes and wished they had a hood on them? Ever looted a set of hooded robes and wished they [i]didn\\'t[/i]? Well, now you just need to take them to your nearest tanning rack to fix that problem. The list of crafting recipes won\\'t be cluttered by all the possible conversions, either, because only the recipes for the robes in your inventory show up. This mod also corrects the enchantment on the Archmage\\'s Robes, so that both sets now give +50 magicka instead of only the hooded robes doing so. This does not affect the texture or mesh of the robes themselves, so retextures and mesh replacers should work fine.\r\n\r\nIn short, what this mod does:\r\n[list][*]Allows you to put hoods on robes and take them off.\r\n[*]Corrects the enchantment of the unhooded Archmage\\'s Robes.\r\n[*]The Hooded Archmage\\'s Robes are now labelled as such, for easier console-commanding.[/list]\r\n\r\nWhat this mod doesn\\'t do, but may in future updates:\r\n[list][*]Allow you to craft the robes themselves.\r\n[*]Make circlets wearable with the plain hooded robes.[/list]\r\n\r\nWhich robes are affected:\r\n[list][*]Thalmor Robes\r\n[*]Archmage\\'s Robes\r\n[*]Monk Robes (all colours)[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]Please note: if you use a custom-enchanted set of robes for crafting, the enchantment will be lost![/b]\r\n\r\nTo install, simply place the .ESP into your data folder, or click the \\\"Download With Manager\\\" button and let NMM do the work for you.
