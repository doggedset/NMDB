  "summary": "A simple overhaul to the perk system in Skyrim, with the changes alchemy and enchanting become less \\\"grindy\\\" and more useful in lower levels, while keeping the balance of the game.The other changes were the Two-Handed perk tree, making it a bit more powerful in late-game; Archery tree had some values edited; Sneak and Speech starting perks were ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Reasons\r\n\r\n  - Two-Handed\r\n\r\n  Problem: The base damage of two handed weapons is not that high, a dual wielder can deal 406% damage bonus, having the right perks, while two handed deals only 150% damage bonus.\r\n\r\n  Solution: Increased the % of the Barbarian perk from 20% to 30% and the perks Deep Wounds, Limp Splitter and Skulls Crusher works with all two handed weapons. With these changes two handed become fairly powerful but remains weaker than dual wielding.\r\n\r\n\r\n  - Lockpicking\r\n\r\n   Problem: Get the Skeleton Key and forget about lockpicking.\r\n\r\n   Solution: Split the lockpick tree in two, the right side focus on your perfomance with picks and the other focus on rewards you may get from locked chests.The level requirements for Apprentice/Adept/Expert/Master were reduced due to the fact that was \\'irrational\\' making Unbreakable and Master Locks only available at level 100\r\n\r\n  - Alchemy\r\n\r\n   Problem: Not useful to use unless you knew ingredients proprieties, also extremely \\'grindy\\' and not fun.\r\n\r\n   Solution: Imagine a real life scenario: \\\"You are going to make some food, what you do? Put some random ingredients and hope for success OR put the ingredients you know, but due to your cooking skill the taste ends up being not so good? \\\" The alchemy tree in Skyrim followed the first option, so I modified the tree to Experimenter be the first perk(also lowered the level requirements) while Physician and Benefactor are only available later in the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n - Enchanting\r\n\r\n  Problem: The perk tree makes you want Extra Effect, so you grind your way up.\r\n\r\n Solution: Extra Effect  requires only 40 in Enchanting but Corpus Enchanter and Insightful Enchanter require much higher levels, making two enchantments at once fairly weak in without these perks, of course having the possibility of enchanting the same item twice helps in leveling faster, making it less \\'grindy\\'.\r\n\r\n- Destruction\r\n\r\n  Problem: Not a \\'real\\' problem, but an issue in late-game when spells are very weak compared to wielding an weapon.\r\n\r\n  Solution: Changed the values of the Augmented perks from 25% to 50%(Rank 1) and 50% to 100%(Rank2).\r\n\r\n- Sneak & Speechcraft\r\n\r\n  Problem: The Stealth and Haggling perks were useless, only giving a 40% bonues in the last rank, which could be easily substituted with enchanting, now these perks follow the same logic of the weapons perks giving a 20%/40%/60%/80%/100% boost in sneak/selling prices .",
