  "descriptionHtml": "== Cutthroat Merchants ==\r\n\r\nIf you\\'ve played Skyrim for more than one hour you\\'ll have noticed that it is easy to get rich. Very easy. Gold is abundant after a short while and you can\\'t even sell most of your loot to merchants since they don\\'t have enough money to buy everything you have. Your speech skill doesn\\'t make that much of a difference and more money isn\\'t needed anyway.\r\n\r\nThis mod decreases the amount of gold you get for selling items and increases the amount of gold you need to pay for buying items. There are four esps - easy, medium, hard and very hard. Pick one of them.\r\n\r\nBy default in the vanilla game you sell items for 50% the price with 100 speech and for 30% the price with 0 speech. Perks will give you even more gold when selling items. For buying it\\'s the other way around, with 100 speech you will buy items for 200% of the original value, with 0 speech for 330%.\r\n\r\nThis mod changes it to the following values depending on the esp you choose:\r\n\r\n- Very Hard -\r\n\r\n100 speech - 20% sell / 500% buy\r\n0 speech - 7% sell / 1500% buy\r\n\r\n\r\n- Hard -\r\n\r\n100 speech - 25% sell / 400% buy\r\n0 speech - 8% sell / 1200% buy\r\n\r\n\r\n- Medium -\r\n\r\n100 speech - 33% sell / 300% buy\r\n0 speech - 11% sell / 900% buy\r\n\r\n\r\n- Easy -\r\n\r\n100 speech - 40% sell / 250% buy\r\n0 speech - 13% sell / 750% buy\r\n\r\n\r\n- Vanilla -\r\n\r\n100 speech - 50% sell / 200% buy\r\n0 speech - 30% sell / 330% buy\r\n\r\n\r\n= Installation =\r\n\r\nPut ONE of the esps into your data folder and activate it in the launcher/mod manager/plugins.txt. To remove the mod simply delete the esp, the merchant prices will be back to normal.",
