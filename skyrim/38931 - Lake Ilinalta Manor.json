The house has three defined paths off the main road 2 of which are sign posted.\r\nThe House mainly consists of three levels and a secret retreat (unknown location) only accessible through the house\\'s internal portal system. The three main parts or levels of the house consist of the main house, basement and lower basement which are all accessible via manual entrance / exits or using the internal portal system.\r\nThe portal system is not just internal as in the Basement and Secret Retreat you have access to two more portal systems one for Markarth, Riften, Solitude, Whiterun and Windhelm while the other for Dawnstar, Falkreath, Morthal and Winterhold and they work using a scripted menu system.\r\n\r\n*** The Portals will take you and any / all follower/s to the menu destination/s.\r\n\r\nThe mod also gives you two additional locations:\r\n\r\nDoll\\'s Lagoon -\t\t\tA Lagoon for (yeah you guessed it) mannequin dolls 4 NPC / Followers.\r\n\t\t\t\tThe dolls here though have been placed in a beautiful scenic cave with water features cascading throughout.\r\n\t\t\t\tAccess via a portal on the lake\\'s island where \\'The Lady Stone\\' resides\r\n\t\t\t\tLiving Quarters for your Staff and Player inc Master bedroom with ensuite, a main living quarter for your staff inc Cooking Area / Shower / Lounge / \t\t\t\t\tBeds.\r\n\t\t\t\tAlchemy Station\r\n\t\t\t\tDedicated Potion / Poison racks\r\n\t\t\t\tFungal Cave\r\n\t\t\t\tShrine of Dibella\r\n\r\nFolgunruud\t-\t\tMain location setting for \\'Claudia\\'s Challenge\\' (See Below)  \t\t\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my 1st \\'released\\' Skyrim mod but it\\'s the 5th house mod I\\'ve created using the CK and with over 1000 hours spent in the CK you can rest easy that this is not a newbie attempt. That said it\\'s still my 1st release and while I\\'ve ironed out many issues and bugs through testing, there maybe something I\\'ve overlooked. \r\nNo copy and paste in this mod, it\\'s been built from the ground up with many texture changes but Lore friendly as can be. \r\n\r\n\r\n*** Cleaned with TES5Edit ***\r\n\r\n\t________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFEATURES:\r\n\t________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nStables  -\t\t\tmax 3 horses inc 1 x encounter horse plus a player owned fast horse \\'Atacama\\'\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimal Pen -\t\t3 x Chickens - 1 x Cow\r\n\r\n\r\nStone Built Dock - \t\t1 x Row Boat \\'Water Dragon\\' a portal to skyrim\\'s docks\r\n\t\t\t\t2 x fishing points \r\n\r\n\r\nMain Gate - \t\tStone built turrets - Player Triggered Gate (Opens & Closes Automatically) \r\n\r\n\r\nRoads/ Paths -\t\t\t3 x defined paths off the main south bank road of Lake Ilinalta which lead to the House (2 paths are sign posted)\r\n\r\n\r\nPatio - \t\t\t\tKistina one of your 2 bard\\'s included will perform everyday and in the evening she\\'ll perform for a small audience \r\n\r\n\r\nMain Hall - \t\t\tChairs and Benches surround a large central fireplace \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\nDining Room - \t\t\t2 x 4 Seated Dining Tables - Storage (Cupboards etc)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlchemy room -            \t*Potion / *Poison Racks / Fungus and flower gardens\r\n \t\t\t\t*Potion/Poison Racks are labeled and the racks display are made using static items. \r\n\r\n\r\nKitchen with Cook - \t\tFully stocked and functioning with Estelle Ashton your cook\r\n\t\t\t\tShe also makes her own secret recipe - Juniper Brandy a unique drink not found anywhere else in Skyrim and has restore stamina level and rate + restore \t\t\t\thealth without and adverse effects or any addiction.\r\n\t\t\t\tYou can purchase this from her along with all the vanilla food & drink.\r\n\t\t\t        \r\n\r\nSeveral Bedrooms - \t\tSeveral bedrooms for staff and the player inc 4 Master Bed/rooms (Manor/Lower basement/DB Sanctuary/Doll\\'s Lagoon)\r\n\t\t\t\t* All beds are owned by the player ;) and all residents belong to the player bed faction.

She will send you on a challenge which starts via a note that will direct you to a unique nordic ruin called \\'Folgunruud\\' which is infested with high level Draugre amongst other foes. The encounter zone created for this ruin is set to min level 30 with no max level set and with no restrictions on entry so you can attempt it at any level\r\nThe quest will show all stage entries in the Side Quest section of your Journal.\r\n    \r\n\t\t****\t\t\tWARNING\t\tWARNING\t\tWARNING\t\tWARNING\t\tWARNING\t\tWARNING\t\t\t\t****\r\n\r\nOnce you get so far into Folgunruud there\\'s no going back and the only way out is to complete the challenge which as I\\'ve stated has many high leveled draugre foe\\'s waiting to ruin your day. I\\'ve tried completing the Folgunruud part of Claudia\\'s Challenge with a charactor at level 4 and with TGM enabled it took an age to work through the ruin, which is a medium to large sized ruin that should give even the best high level player\\'s a good hour of gameplay from start to finish. I will not give too much away only to say the loot at the end will be worth the effort in the form of a unique and powerful item for skyrim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nEXTRA FEATURES\r\n\t_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nI\\'ve created a conjuration spell tomb which summons \\'Sister Saadia\\' a character based on the vanilla character Saadia, she will use a plethora of powerfull spells for 60 secs in your aid. To summon her costs very little magicka and shouldn\\'t be a problem for even low level players to cast and the book can be purchased from the Riverwood Trader.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRECOMMENDED MODS\r\n\t__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nThe House is a stand alone mod which does NOT require any DLC or mod to run. \r\nAll that said I would highly recommend the following awesome mods to get the full effect intended from this mod.\r\n\r\n\r\nClimates of Tamriel (Vanilla Nights 3) - JJTV \r\nLanterns of Skyrim - Mannygt Mods (this mod lights up one of the Manor\\'s road sign posts though not a requirment) \r\nApachii Sky Hair - Apachii\r\nCover Women Look1 - mrlenski\r\nHQ eyes - Xenius\r\nUNP Dimonized skinny female body - Dimon99 (or CBBE which ever) ***ADULT ONLY***\r\n\r\n\r\n\t__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKNOWN ISSUES / POSSIBLE CONFLICTS ?\r\n\t__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod will only conflict with mods that use the same cell/s - refer to map location for details. \r\n \r\nNOTE* When you activate the dolls and mannequins the game will display a \\'Talk *NPC name\\' message as opposed to \\'activate mannequin\\' message but otherwise they work exactly the same as the vanilla mannequins.\r\n\r\n*** On your 1st visit to interior of the house you will most likely encounter invisible barriers which are the mannequins misbehaving, if so just leave the cell and reload it and they should have settled. On rare occassions it may take 2 - 3 loads for some of them to settle down, but after this they will remain in postion. \r\n\r\nBoth the Secret Retreat and the Doll\\'s Lagoon do not have load doors and can only be accessed via portals, so the followers from these cells need to be dismissed from service in their\r\nnative cells or they will just get stuck where you dismiss them.\r\n\r\nSeveral X-Markers have been placed at all cities and towns for the portal system to work.\r\n\r\n5 x row boats + x markers added for \\'The Water Dragon\\'s\\' travel system (windhelm docks / Solitude Docks / Riften Docks (rear Honeyside) / Dawnstar Sanctuary Beach & Lake ilinalta Manor Dock) \r\n\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCREDITS\r\n\t__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nA big thankyou to the following (not in any order)\r\n\r\nBethesda \r\nSteam \r\nSkyrim Nexus\r\nCreation Kit Wiki \r\nArtisanix for his framed art resources. \r\nAll the community for their mods / hard work / priceless info and inspiration for without this mod would not exist.\r\n\r\nand a special thankyou to the following tutorial authors: \r\n\r\nDarkfox 127 \r\nBalok\\'s    framed artwork tutorials\r\nHellcat 5  \r\nMillerboy  \r\nNeuroSpasm \r\nBethesda\\'s tutorial series \r\nJNTolm \r\nGophersVids\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\t___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFUTURE PLANS\r\n\t___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nI will be adding some quests for both the Vampire Velva and also some Dark Brotherhood (or in the case of the Manor\\'s lack of Male Actors) some Dark Sisterhood quests :) \r\nI may also add a quest to purchase the house if enough request it, but as it stands the house and staff are completely free.\r\n\r\nI will most likely release a DLC version in the not too distant future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFEEDBACK\r\n\t___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nThe Mod was made for you so feel free to give your feedback though I will only respond to constructive criticsm purely made for the improvement of the mod and to resolve issues (where possible).\r\n\r\nAny suggestions for additions or adjustments will be considered.\r\n\r\nPlease return and give your rating and or subscribe thankyou.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVAILABLE @ SKYRIM NEXUS ONLY (ATM)\r\n\r\nDO NOT RE-DISTRIBUTE ANYWHERE ELSE WITHOUT PRIOR PERMISSION FROM MYSELF SO AS TO KEEP TRACK AND UP-TO-DATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tADDITIONAL INFO\r\n\t___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nCK exterior Cell Memory Loads\r\n\r\n149.99Mb 109% - Lake Ilinalta Manor Ext1\r\n\r\nCK Interior Cell Memory Loads\r\n\r\n112.58Mb < 100%\tMain House Cell\r\n 97.90Mb < 100%\tBasement\r\n113.44Mb < 100%\tLower Basement\r\n118.04Mb < 100%\tSecret Level\r\n 65.32Mb < 100%\tFolgunruud\r\n\t < 100% Doll\\'s Lagoon\r\n\r\nMod was tested using win7x64 based Intel i5 2500K / SSD / 8Gb Ram / EVGA GTX570 (no O/C) @ Ultra Video settings (1680 x 1050 resolution)",
