  "descriptionHtml": "==== Gate of Babylon ====\r\n \r\n\r\nWIP\r\n\r\n== DEAR MODDERS ==\r\nAs I scrounge through the myriads of Skyrim mods, it\\'s come to my attention that there are a vast number of Fate mods that are released day by day. These numbers were much greater than my imagination and many are high quality work that have been cleverly crafted using sophisticated coding. As a scripting novice, my first works were simple and although I am eager to learn, some of these works are much more advanced and would definitely take more time for me to master. I know that GoB is popular amongst the Fate & TM fans, and I cannot stop to think that if these authors decided to put a tiny effort in making their interpretation of GoB, it would be miles better than anything I could create. This does not mean I will stop pursuing my interpretation of GoB but I want to send the message so that they are not discouraged in releasing what might become a second-placer just because a novice such as myself has registered it on nexsus - because I know that their\\'s is going to be better.\r\n\r\ntl;dr\r\nMay this name registered under nexus not be a hindrance to you in creating GoB.\r\n\r\n== RELEASE NOTES ==\r\nThis is my first mod, and in an attempt to reproduce \\\"Gate of Babylon\\\" from Fate/Stay Night.\r\n\r\n\r\n== VIDEO ==\r\nWhat this does\r\nhttp://youtu.be/yLHYv7lQNHk\r\n\r\nWhat you can do with Time Freeze Mod (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9649) to make it somewhat feel like GoB at v0.1\r\nhttp://youtu.be/45kOOT9nzoc\r\n\r\n== DESCRIPTION ==\r\nAdds a Conjuration spell \\\"Lesser Gate of Babylon\\\" which fires a projectile sword imitating Vajra and explodes on impact that you can learn via a spell tome.\r\nTo obtain it, go to console and type: \r\n\r\nhelp \\\"lesser gate\\\" 4\r\n\r\nIt will prompt with three different IDs, so pick the book one and then type:\r\n\r\nplayer.additem (bookid) 1\r\n\r\n== INSTALLATION ==\r\nPlace \\\"Lesser_GoB.esp\\\" and \\\"meshes\\\" into your Skyrim\\\\Data folder.\r\n\r\n== UNINSTALLATION ==\r\nRemove the following files\r\n\r\nLesser_GoB.esp\r\nPetiteGoB (located in Skrim\\\\Data\\\\meshes)\r\n\r\n== VERSION HISTORY ==\r\nv0.1 Initial release\r\n\r\n== THINGS TO DO ==\r\nMake the hand animation red, like real Gate of Babylon\r\nRandomise weapon throws so different weapons are fired\r\nMake weapons pick-upable.\r\nActually look like GoB with a wall of fire\r\n\r\n== CREDITS ==\r\nInspired by Reality Marble Unlimited Blade Works (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvbJjqkQVk8&feature=player_e%C2%ADmbedded)\r\nTime Freeze Mod (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9649) for the second video in youtube",
