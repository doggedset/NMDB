His hair and fur brushes are especially favored by digital artists.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Collection of Dave Nagel's Free Photoshop and Illustrator plugins\n<br />=================================================================\n<br />\n<br />Hunted down and put together in one place by Darklocq\n<br />\n<br />This is a complete collection of the now-legendary Adobe Photoshop and\n<br />Illustrator tools (mostly naturalistic texturing brushes) created by\n<br />Dave Nagel and released on his blogs (mostly in 2002-2006 or so), free\n<br />for personal and even commercial use. Just his gifts to the world.\n<br />\n<br />For over a decade, most of his material was only findable by digging\n<br />around in Wayback.Archive.org; finding them all in 2018 took many hours\n<br />to get most of them, and another two weeks to find a missing one.\n<br />\n<br />Many of these will be of use to digital artists who need to do realistic\n<br />or stylized human skin, hair, and other natural textures. You'll often\n<br />see recommendations to use these brushes, but no download links for them\n<br />that have worked since ca. 2006.  This collection aims to fix that issue,\n<br />and includes every known release of this sort that he did for Photoshop\n<br />and Illustrator. (I left out his stuff for other tools than PS and AI -\n<br />some obscure, some video-oriented, or it would have taken twice as\n<br />long to put this together, for little benefit, since it's the PS and AI\n<br />tools that people are looking for.)\n<br />\n<br />The Goodies\n<br />===========\n<br />\n<br />Some general info on each of the brush sets and other tools included here\n<br />is provided below. The releases were numbered, so that's how they're\n<br />presented here.  See the URLs for more detail, usually including examples\n<br />and how-to info (though you may need to try alternative domain names, also\n<br />listed below, in a few cases, if the example and tutorial images have gone\n<br />missing).\n<br />\n<br />Some of these tools may not work, without some kind of conversion, in new\n<br />versions of PS and AI.  How to do that is beyond the scope of this\n<br />document (i.e., I really have no idea).\n<br />\n<br />A folder of screenshots of the effects is included to easily\n<br />identify which brush set, action, or filter does what.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Illustrator\n<br />===========\n<br />\n<br />1, cloth and other natural media:\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2002/11_nov/features/download7021115.htm\n<br />2, art brushes (simple):\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2003/07_jul/features/download37030711.htm\n<br />3, fat art brushes, with some blending:\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2003/08_aug/features/download42030820.htm\n<br />4, vector art brushes, 3D paint look:\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2003/10_oct/features/download49031017.htm\n<br />5, pencils and thin brushes:\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2003/11_nov/features/download51031103.htm\n<br />\n<br />Text\n<br />----\n<br />\n<br />1, editable distortion and texture effects for text:\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2003/02_feb/features/download18030221.htm\n<br />2, glow, shadow and border effects for text:\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2003/04_apr/features/download26030425.htm\n<br />\n<br />Filters (Effects)\n<br />----------------\n<br />\n<br />1, SVG filters for creating color and noise effects:\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2003/03_mar/features/download23030328.htm\n<br />2, resolution-independent soft bevel filters:\n<br />https://wayback.archive.org/web/20040604031206/http://www.creativemac.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=24011\n<br />\n<br />Photoshop\n<br />=========\n<br />\n<br />From www.CreativeMac.com (still providing these as of 2018-05, at\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2003/11_nov/features/downloadindex031117.htm \n<br />while the \"Downloads\" section is otherwise not working):\n<br />\n<br />1: cloth, rags, sponges and rollers (as painting implements):\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2002/10_oct/features/download1021004.htm\n<br />2: charcoal, chalk, conte and crayon:\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2002/10_oct/features/download4021025.htm\n<br />3: textured brushes for Adobe Photoshop 7:\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2002/12_dec/features/download10021213.htm\n<br />4, assorted custom brushes for Adobe Photoshop 7:\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2003/02_feb/features/download16030207.htm \n<br />5, distress textures (for \"old look\" on photos, or apply to metal, etc.):\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2003/02_feb/features/download17030214.htm\n<br />6, textured (sandstone, etc.) http://www.creativemac.com/2003/04_apr/features/download25030418.htm\n<br />7, dynamic and textured brushes - maybe good for under-layer:\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2003/05_may/features/download29030516.htm\n<br />8, nature-themed texture brushes:\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2003/05_may/features/download31030530.htm\n<br />9, squiggle brushes, one looks like treasure trail:\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2003/07_jul/features/download36030707.htm\n<br />10, bristled and textured brushes:\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2003/07_jul/features/download39030725.htm\n<br />11, brushes for cloud and vapor trail effects:\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2003/08_aug/features/download41030811.htm\n<br />12, hair and fur:\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2003/08_aug/features/download43030828.htm\n<br />13, crayon and chalk brushes:\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2003/10_oct/features/download50031024.htm\n<br />14, sky effect brushes:\n<br />http://www.creativemac.com/2003/12_dec/features/download542.htm\n<br />\n<br />Via Wayback (from CreativeMac.DigitalMediaNet.com, www.CreativeMac.com,\n<br />DigitalDesigner.DigitalMediaNet.com, MacDesignPro.DigitalMediaNet.com,\n<br />www.MacDesignPro.com, Photoshop.DigitalMediaNet.com, www.CorporateMediaNews.com,\n<br />CorporateMediaNews.DigitalMediaNet.com, www.DigitalMediaDesigner.com,\n<br />www.DMNForums.com, www.DigitalProducer.com, Oceania.DigitalMediaNet.com,\n<br />DigitalProducer.DigitalMediaNet.com, Images.DigitalMedia.com,\n<br />AnimationArtist.DigitalMedia.net, www.AnimationArtist.com,\n<br />AudioVideoProducer.DigitalMediaNet.com, www.AudioVideoProducer.com,\n<br />www.DigitalVideoEditing.com, etc. This guy has a lot of domain names that\n<br />are all really the same server with the same file paths.
