  "descriptionHtml": "[b][center][size=&#34;5&#34;]The Pale Redux[/size][/center][/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />When I first read about Skyrim in the lore from previous elder scrolls games, I had a much different impression of what the land actually looked like when compared to Bethesda&#39;s vision which was released to us. This mod is a representation of the mental image I created when I first read about Skyrim. This module only affects The Pale, but I have differing opinions on much of the Skyrim landscape, so you can expect changes in all (read: most) of the Holds.\r<br />\r<br />Once all the trees were removed, The Pale takes on a whole new identity. I&#39;ll be adding more rocks, snow and ice to really complete the look but I think it looks great as it is right now&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This is the second release in this series of mods so if you&#39;re interested in my other work you can check out [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30734/?]Hjaalmarch Redux[/url] as well&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Current Release[/b] : [u]Version .1b[/u]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Release Changes[/b]\r<br />\r<br />- Removes 99.9 percent of trees from The Pale.\r<br />- Minor Tweaks\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Future Releases[/b]\r<br />\r<br />- More Rocks, Ice, and Snow&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]Compatibility[/b]\r<br />\r<br />This mod is currently compatible with most mods that make changes to The Pale as long as you properly sort your load order, whichever changes you want to show should be the later ESP in the load order. If a patch is necessary and requested for compatibility with a major mod I will do my best to provide that for you all.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Highly Suggested Mods[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/141/?]Skyrim Flora Overhaul[/url] by Vurt\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24460/?]Supreme and Volumetric Fog[/url] by MannyGT\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19446/?]Skyrim Distance Overhaul LOD Improvement Mod[/url] by Grieche\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]FAQs[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Q: Will you make this change for me?\r<br />A: I&#39;m always willing to listen to new ideas, but unless its listed under the future release section, it probably won&#39;t be made by me.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Is this compatible with &#34;X&#34; mod?\r<br />A: If it makes changes to the The Pale, most likely not. If you think a patch will be worthwhile, mention it in the comments section and I will take a look.\r<br />\r<br />Q: I like [i]this[/i] change, but [i]that[/i] change makes me cringe.\r<br />A: Thats really not a question, but I&#39;ll answer it anyway. The release of this mod is modular, meaning that you might be able to find a version of the mod with the changes you like without the changes you don&#39;t.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Addendum[/b]\r<br />\r<br />If you enjoy this mod, think its a good idea, or even hate it; please leave a comment&#33; Feedback is what tells me what I need to change and what I should keep. Endorsements are, as always, most appreciated as well.",
