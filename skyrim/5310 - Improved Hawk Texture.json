  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first texture mod ever so I\\'ve would be glad if you provided some sort of feedback. \r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE:\r\nI found (when I was hunting birds) that hawks have a really bad texture and I thought that someone  should do an improvment so I went on the nexus and searched for hawk and bird but nothing came up so I decided to do this little file, and eventually decided to release it to the public.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION:\r\nWhat I\\'ve done is that I cranked up the size of the texture aswell as adding a sharpness filter to both the normal map and the texture itself. This provided a \\\"cleaner\\\" looking texture which didn\\'t look half bad in-game.\r\n\r\nINSTALL:\r\nPut the Texture folder into the Data folder in the Skyrim Main Directory (C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\)\r\nIF asked to overwrite click yes and it will continue.\r\nThat\\'s about it. Enjoy!",
