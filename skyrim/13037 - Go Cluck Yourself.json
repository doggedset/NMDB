  "descriptionHtml": "This spell tome allows you turn any living creature into a chicken.  \r\n\r\nThe spell is based off an existing power that Bethesda created and included with their Creation Kit on Steam.  That power allowed you to transform yourself into a skeever for 60 seconds, once per day.\r\n\r\nBecause not everything was coded and finished, the spell does have some glitches.  I added some code to the papyrus script to make it semi-realistic.  The effect appears to be permanent, even if you have the duration of the effect set to a specific length.\r\n\r\n\r\n** I guess it would help if I told you where it\\'s located at.  lol.  You can find it on your nightstand next to your bed upstairs in your Breezehome in Whiterun.  Also, if you prefer just to use the console, the object id# is  02000D64  ",
