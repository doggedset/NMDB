  "descriptionHtml": "Was bored and thought iron armor needed a little something, and so I stuck a bloody (or maybe it\\'s just red paint) handprint on it.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s mostly intended as a modder\\'s resource; until the toolset becomes available, all you can really do with it is retexture every iron cuirass in the game. Looks cool, though.\r\n\r\nIf you want me to stick this or some other random decal on some armor for you and make it look nice, send me a message and I\\'ll see what I can do.\r\n\r\nOnly the cuirass is modified. Both male and female versions are included.\r\n\r\nRights:\r\nFeel free to use this in your mod, but give me credit, and please let me know! I\\'ll want to take a look at what you\\'ve done with it.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nBethesda for making the original texture.\r\nMyself for fiddling with it in Photoshop.\r\n\r\nTo install as a retexture:\r\nPlace the textures folder in Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\ and merge.\r\n\r\nTo uninstall:\r\nDelete cuirassplate.dds from Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\iron\\\\m\\\\ and Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\armor\\\\iron\\\\f\\\\.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\nv1.00: Initial release.\r\nv1.10: Modified the female version slightly to better maintain the handprint\\'s aspect ratio.\r\nv1.20: Shifted the handprint on the female version to the side to fix the centered version\\'s weird tweaky finger issue (caused by the texture\\'s deformation around the breast cup). Now carries a slightly more sexual connotation, but at least it looks better.",
