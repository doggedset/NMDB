  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://img5.fotos-hochladen.net/uploads/titlepicvasyw8l1xq.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Requirements[/b][/u]\r<br />-) Skyrim\r<br />-) The latest patch\r<br />-) Dawnguard DLC\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][youtube]664JxD7zLbM[/youtube]\r<br />Big thanks to [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/hodilton]hodilton[/url] for his awesome video.[/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://img5.fotos-hochladen.net/uploads/descriptiondq2jx73ho8.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Finally it&#39;s ready to release my next bigger project. This time I present you a awesome location or house inside the Forgotten Vale. I have always thought that the Forgotten Vale offers a beautiful scenery. Also the snow elf architecture is unique and offers a great potential. It doesn&#39;t need much clutter to make the house or location feel unique and special.\r<br />The house comes with several features and some really well thought scripted events. Don&#39;t worry as you hear scripted, because every script is checked and shouldn&#39;t harm your game.\r<br />You will be able to acquire the house directly. Just discover it at the given location. There is somehow a quest involved. You ask what? Well you have to reach the Forgotten Vale\r<br />and this only happens during the Dawnguard questline. So you have to play the Dawnguard questline in order to get there. \r<br />([i]NOTE: If there are many requests, I will enable the map marker from load[/i]).\r<br />\r<br />[b][u][color=#99ccff]Backstory:[/color][/u][/b]\r<br />[i][center]The house has not directly a quest but is integrated into the Dawnguard questline.\r<br />I have originally thought about letting it be a reward for completing the questline.\r<br />In addition to the Artifact you get. You ask how?\r<br />Well the house is a research base of [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Arch-Curate_Vyrthur]Arch-Curate Vyrthur[/url], where he wants to bring the snow elves back to former glory.\r<br />You will find the entrance blocked by his magic (Don&#39;t worry you will find a way to enter).\r<br />The name [b][color=#66ccff]Fahliil Alok[/color][/b] stands for [b][color=#66ccff]Elf Arise[/color][/b].... A prophecy?? ... A plan??? Find it out, by defeating Vyrthur.\r<br />You will unlock the full potential of the house, once you have defeated the Arch-Curate Vyrthur.\r<br />Once he is defeated you will find his personal stuff or chest directly beneath the bow of Auriel.[/center][/i]\r<br />\r<br />So go get your house and defeat the Arch-Curate Vyrthur in order to reveal his plan and benefit from it.\r<br />Once you are inside the house you have to defeat a Ancient Guardian in order to get the key (He will clear himself after the cell resets).\r<br />If you can&#39;t find the house, a Location Screenshot is inlcuded in the download, as well as in the images section.\r<br />The house should be easy to find, as it&#39;s directly at the big frozen lake.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#66ccff]In order to gain access to the cave, you need to defeat Vyrthur in the Dwanguard questline. You will than find his personal stuff in a chest, directly where you find Auriels Bow.[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://img5.fotos-hochladen.net/uploads/featuresqbv2y3wapr.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />In this section I would like to present you the main features of this mod.\r<br />You get a fantastic house, with a fantastic view and location as well as some unique backstory and the possibility to [color=#66ccff]breed your own [b]UNIQUE[/b] chaurus follower.[/color] Also for the first time in my mods I have included a lot of great retextures to match the beautiful architecture of the snow elves.\r<br />\r<br />[u][color=#33ccff]Fahliil Alok:[/color][/u]\r<br />-) Unique atmopshere, even without any graphical enhancement mods\r<br />-) A really great lightning, which is well thought and placed\r<br />-) A unique enchanting table\r<br />-) 5 Mannequins and some retextured weapon plaques\r<br />-) New retextured rugs as well as some really awesome Ayleid cluttter\r<br />-) A very special structure integreated into the frozen scenery of the Forgotten vale\r<br />-) A unique fire place with a great feeling, as well as a fully decorated dinning table\r<br />-) 2 additional beds for potential followers\r<br />-) One secret room, which is the master bedroom\r<br />-) A alchemy station\r<br />-) 2 special scripted display possibilities.

This will allow you to breed a unqiue [color=#66ccff][b]CHAURUS FOLLOWER[/b][/color].\r<br />Yes you read right...
