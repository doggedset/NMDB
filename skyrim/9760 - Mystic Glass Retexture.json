  "descriptionHtml": "Re-texture for all glass armor and weapons. Metal has been lightened and de-saturated to make it seem like silver. Glass has been lightened and re-colored to look more mystical (and less green). \r\n\r\nChillrend is also affected.  Metal is made silver, and glass is more of a light blue than before.\r\n\r\nThe male cuirass has been fixed!  Somehow I uploaded an incomplete file there, so my texture actually looked very similar to the original armor.\r\n\r\nI have noticed one issue that I don\\'t know how to fix on the glass sword.  In the middle of the blade from some angles in third person view there is a black line, almost like a glitch in the mesh.  I\\'ve noticed it on a couple other mods for the glass sword and it may even appear in the original game files.  \r\n\r\nFeel free to edit, use and share my re-texture as much as you like. I don\\'t even need credit, though that would be cool. :)",
