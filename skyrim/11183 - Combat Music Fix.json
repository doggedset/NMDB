  "descriptionHtml": "Sometimes when a player has a very high armor rating, combat music may not play. This little mod should fix this.\r\n\r\nI\\'m not a Skyrim modder, so this is my first try at the Creation Kit. Not getting any combat music when wearing Deadric Armor killed the mood for me. This little fix just changes some (undocumented?) gameplay settings. It works for me, but I cannot give any guarantee that it does for you. For example, insanely high armor ratings achieved through enchanting/alchemy might still not work.\r\n\r\nDownload at your own risk.\r\n\r\nLeave a comment if you like the mod. :-)",
