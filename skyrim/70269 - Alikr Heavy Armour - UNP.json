  "summary": "Armour for the Alik&#39;r warrior, based on the Redguard outfit, my own Alik&#39;r Dancer outfit, and the Steel Plate body armour.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The Alik&#39;r in Skyrim have only clothing to distinguish them from the other races. Once they put on the standard armours, they look just like everyone else. This mod gives you an alternative, that fits in with the existing style.\r<br />\r<br />You can make the pieces at any forge, as Steel Plate. The recipe is slightly different for the Alik&#39;r version, as you&#39;ll need Linen Wraps for the cape/cloak, and a little less steel.",
