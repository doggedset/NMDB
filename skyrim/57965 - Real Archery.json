  "descriptionHtml": "[center][/center][center][/center][center][img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/images/110/7756592-1410221253.png[/img]\r<br />[font=Georgia]\r<br />...Real Archery is ready to change the way you play...\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=6][i]---NEW BOWS AND ITEMS---[/i][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=6][i]---NEW UPDATE READ AFTER BOWS AND ARROWS---[/i][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />This does not change anything dramatically. I have tested this mod in my own game and have made it perfectly balanced and fun.\r<br />\r<br />SNIPER OR QUICK DRAW\r<br />you choose\r<br />\r<br />[/font][font=Georgia]I have changed bows for a more realistic way of playing. The way Bethesda set up the bows, was so damn basic...\r<br />This mod changes the pull speed and equalizes it with damage to make the bows function like real bows. \r<br />[quote]&#34;Must have been the gynecologist&#34; ~Random Guy At The Restaurant~[/quote][b][color=#ff0000]BOWS[/color][/b]\r<br />[u][i]...For example...[/i][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[b]-Long Bow[/b]: The long bow was meant for maximum power, but in the game you can pull it back like its got two pounds on it. \r<br />[/font]This mod would make this one more realistic by increasing the draw time to simulate a harder pull, but adds damage to the bow, to simulate the thrust actually adding much more stopping power \r<br />[font=Georgia]\r<br />[/font]\r<br />[font=Georgia][b]-Hunting Bow:[/b] The hunting bow in Skyrim actually has a short bow frame. Thus making it easier to pull back faster, but have less damage. This makes a more realistic game-play by adjusting pull time and damage. Compared to the long bow it is faster but has less damage.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]ARROWS[/color]\r<br />[i][u]...For example...\r<br />[/u][/i][/font]\r<br />[font=Georgia]The arrows in this game have been setup for only damage increase dependent on the material of the arrow, really?\r<br />\r<br />[/font][b]-Iron arrow:[/b] The iron arrow realistically should be heavier and should have more stopping power. What i did to make the iron arrow more realistic is change the effects of gravity and speed of the arrow while in flight.\r<br />\r<br />[b]-Ebony arrow:[/b] Since the ebony arrow is a very streamline and bodkin style arrow, I made it more realistic by making it faster and lighter while in flight. It may have a little less power than a broad-head but you can get it to your target faster. \r<br />[quote]&#34;Unzip Zip Unzip Zip Unzip, This is fun&#34; ~Me with my girl~[/quote][color=#ff0000][size=4]NEW UPDATE[/size][/color]\r<br />[b]-Classy Bows:[/b] I have added two new types of bows for every regular bow&#33; Each bow now has a Light and Heavy variant&#33; All fully craft-able&#33; \r<br />\r<br />-Heavy bows are stronger but have longer pull.\r<br />-Heavy bows +5 damage, -pull speed\r<br />-Light bows -5 damage +pull speed\r<br />-All bows require bow strings\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#ff0000]NEW ITEMS[/color]\r<br />[/size]-Bow String\r<br />-Bow String (Heavy)\r<br />-Bow String (Light)\r<br />-Heavy and Light variants of almost all bows\r<br />[quote]&#34;The Gods know how much milk you put in your cereal&#34; ~Nazeem~  [/quote]\r<br />[b]Installation:[/b] Just unzip and move the esp into your data folder\r<br />[b]Uninstall: [/b]Just do the opposite...
