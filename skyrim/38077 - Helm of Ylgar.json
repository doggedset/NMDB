  "descriptionHtml": "From The Elder Scrolls Wiki:\r<br />     Ylgar was the youngest son of the legendary Ysgramor, he also had an older brother, Yngol. Ylgar, as well as his brother and father, sailed to Tamriel fleeing civil war on Atmora. Along with other settlers, Ylgar and his family were inhabitants of Saarthal and were there during the elven raid, Night of Tears. Ylgar is said to be among the three survivors. He, along with Ysgramor and his brother, fled back to Atmora.\r<br />     After returning to Atmora, Ylgar was already known as a warrior possessed of an unwavering spirit that drove his singular prowess to overwhelming feats in war. Ylgar sought to avenge to his fallen brothers and sisters so joined the Five Hundred Companions, led by his father. He commissioned two ships for himself and his brother and became the captain of Darumzu. Yngol and Ylgar sailed out of the massive shipyards of Jylkurfyk, not knowing that this was the last time they would meet.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Extract the plugin in the /Skyrim/Data folder and make sure this mod is checked on the load order; that&#39;s it&#33;\r<br />\r<br />What this mod does:\r<br />Makes the Ancient Nord Helmet female model the same as male (why they are not the same, I don&#39;t know)\r<br />Gives female Argonians the antlered mesh they did not originally have\r<br />Makes a new helmet Helm of Ylgar using the antlered draugr helm model (with Heavy Armor enchantment and tempering recipe)\r<br />Places that new Helm in the room and under the ownership of the Harbinger of the Companions\r<br />\r<br />Future plans:\r<br />Make the helmet more fearsome\r<br />Make a new unique armour set\r<br />Change enchantment for helm (many have suggested shock resistance)",
