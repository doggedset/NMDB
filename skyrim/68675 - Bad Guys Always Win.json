  "descriptionHtml": "Get tired of the Guild never giving you respect? Well worry no more. After Mercer tempts to steal the Falmer Eyes, you can side with him, but only if your okay with being intimate with the asshole. \r<br />\r<br />You have two chances to side with him. If you decline both times he will disappear or you can kill him. You can marry him, but his dialogue will not be like other husbands- he&#39;ll still be a asshole, but he&#39;ll be your asshole.",
