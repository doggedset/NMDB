  "descriptionHtml": "TES5edit-cleaned&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=100320905]Steam version[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#cccccc][b]Silver Falls Lodge[/b][/color] sits on the southern shore of beautiful Lake Ilinalta, just east of Half-Moon Mill. With stunning views offering the sunlit water, The Lady Stone directly north, and surrounding countryside, the grounds boast a garden of both food and alchemy supplies, as well as a full smithy. Within, you&#39;ll find rest, good drink, and fellow hunters to chat with over a flagon of ale.\r<br />\r<br />This home is ideal for hard-core hunters, and you can use it along with &#34;Trophy Hunting&#34; (Nexus), &#34;Hunting in Skyrim&#34;, and &#34;Camp Markers&#34;. They are all compatible.\r<br />\r<br />You&#39;ll find a few notes pinned around the home by iron daggers that explain a few things regarding the making of this mod -- please read them&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The home is fully Navmeshed, and meticulously tested so followers can come in with you. However, on the pier the Navmesh only extends to the water&#39;s edge -- CK wouldn&#39;t let me take it any further than that&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]Marriage:[/b]\r<br />The mod &#34;Spouses Can Live Everywhere&#34; appears to work this mod&#33; So you can bring your beloved here with you :)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#339900][size=+1][b]Features:[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#99ccff][b]Main Hall:[/b][/color]\r<br />- Hand-made aquarium with fish and mudcrab\r<br />- firepit to warm yourself after a hard day of adventuring\r<br />- a Bard to serenade you a while\r<br />- a row of weapon racks to store your hunting bows\r<br />- trophy heads\r<br />- connection to the Drunken Huntsman shop in Whiterun\r<br />- compatible with &#34;Hunting in Skyrim&#34; and &#34;Trophy Hunterin&#34; mods\r<br />\r<br />[color=#99ccff][b]Crafting Room:[/b][/color]\r<br />- Enchanting table\r<br />- Alchemy table\r<br />- 5 separate chests: Potions, Enchanted Items, Ingredients, Food, Arrows\r<br />- fireplace w/ cooking pot\r<br />- weapon plaques, including shield displays\r<br />- 2 small display cases (not yet triggered but will be once I figure out how)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#99ccff][b]Guest Bedroom:[/b][/color]\r<br />- fireplace\r<br />- 2 beds\r<br />- decorative bookshelf\r<br />- wardrobe\r<br />\r<br />[color=#99ccff][b]Player Bedroom:[/b][/color]\r<br />- large bed\r<br />- wardrobe\r<br />- bookshelf\r<br />- chest\r<br />- strongbox\r<br />- 2 weapon plaques\r<br />- fireplace\r<br />\r<br />[color=#99ccff][b]Loft:[/b][/color]\r<br />- Several mannequins for displaying your armor\r<br />- library w/ 2 bookshelves, 1 working storable bookcase, desk\r<br />(the 2 shelves in the corner with books contain several hunting-related skillbooks&#33;)\r<br />- fireplace\r<br />\r<br />[color=#99ccff][b]Basement Pub:[/b][/color]\r<br />- pub sign collection\r<br />- Barkeep who is a Master Alchemy Trainer and Merchant (I thought that seemed fitting)\r<br />- 5 different food storage barrels, labeled\r<br />- raw meat locker\r<br />- 2 cooking pots, firepit\r<br />- hunting taxidermy\r<br />- Hall of Houses, trapdoors connecting to each of the 5 vanilla homes (of course, if you don&#39;t actually -own- the home(s) yet, they will be empty or full of junk)\r<br />- small Player VIP room (if you want a little peace and quiet, this little room is not navmeshed, you can relax by yourself)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#99ccff][b]Outside Grounds:[/b][/color]\r<br />- Vegetable garden,\r<br />- Alchemy garden\r<br />- Full Smithy\r<br />- bedroll for sleeping under the stars\r<br />- 4-Horse stable w/ leveled horses, each unique, essential, and named\r<br />Charger (saddled paint), Blaze (saddled palomino), Cosmo (black), and Willow (pepper gray)\r<br />If you fast-travel to a big city they will wait in the stable, however to get them back to the Lodge you need to ride them back.  I wish I could program them to return there if you get a different horse but I don&#39;t know how&#33;\r<br />- 4 chickens and 4 nests in back of the house\r<br />- Fishing pier with RESPAWNING Fish Barrel, and just off-shore, a sunken ship to explore&#33;\r<br />- nearby vantage point on top of a rocky crag\r<br />- Existing Iron ore vein between smithy and the vantage platform\r<br />\r<br />[color=#99ccff][b]NPCs (all essential):[/b][/color]\r<br />- Garett - the Bard, also a general goods merchant, who sells Light Armor, Potions, Gems, & Books\r<br />- Rowan - a Ranger Scout leveled follower, dressed as a hunter\r<br />- Roweena - Barkeep, Master Alchemy Trainer, Rowan&#39;s sister\r<br />- Tom - the gardener\r<br />- Lem gro-Magon - blacksmith\r<br />- 2 leveled hunters in the pub\r<br />- 3 leveled hunters hanging out on the pier\r<br />\r<br />No unsafe changes&#33; Base instances were duplicated, then edited, so other world objects are not affected.\r<br />- Well, except the mead and wine barrels. Now all mead and wine barrels in the game can potentially hold all types of mead and wine, which is better anyway :)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#339900][size=+1][b]Issues:[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />- So far only the Alchemy merchant (Innkeep) works.  I&#39;m still having trouble getting the others (Blacksmith and General) to function.\r<br />\r<br />Comments and Ratings are much appreciated&#33; Be nice folks, this is my first mod of this size and caliber.\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#339900][size=+1][b]My other mods:[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48497/?][img]http://static2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/48497-1-1386549422.jpg[/img][/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38407/?][img]http://static1.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/38407-1-1386549460.jpg[/img][/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33544/?][img]http://static1.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/33544-1-1386549491.jpg[/img][/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29175/?][img]http://static1.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/29175-1-1386549849.jpg[/img][/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48836/?][img]http://static2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/48836-1-1387537493.jpg[/img][/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48918/?][img]http://static2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/48918-1-1387538412.jpg[/img][/url][/center]",
