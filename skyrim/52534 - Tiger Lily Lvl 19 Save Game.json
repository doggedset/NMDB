  "summary": "My Epic Elf Archer/Thief. Sorry guys, she&#39;s a level 19 and almost done with Dawnguard, and the main quest is..broken? I&#39;ll explain. Anyway, say hello to Tiger Lily (don&#39;t ask me why I named her that..), she&#39;s a sarcastic little nub in my roleplaying thoughts that loves to pull pranks on people and just put them in bad situations.

  "descriptionHtml": "What do you think of Tiger Lily so far? You can change her name if you want to, if it&#39;s kind of getting to ya, no problem, go right ahead&#33; Now..onto the main problem that I would like to discuss..the mainquest.\r<br />\r<br />Alright..alright..just..j-just put the chair/table/weapon down, I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t think I could get that stupid when I did it and there had been a fair warning too. Curse my silly mind&#33; I installed a beautiful mod called Behemoth the Feathered Dragon by Zero Satyr, replaces Odahviing textures and slightly alters the behavior to make him more aggressive. Texture and dragon made completely out of scratch...wonderfully done (like all his other mods&#33;). Well..I caught him in Dragonsreach and take in mind..he&#39;s a lot more aggressive now due to the mod which the author warned everyone about in the description and now due to my thoughtlessness I am paying for it, ahaha&#33; As soon as I release him..he starts attacking me as well as everyone else in Dragonsreach... if anyone can fix that..great&#33;&#33; But I&#39;m sure it is baked into my save, maybe if you don&#39;t install the mod at all..it&#39;ll be fine..but I have a feeling Odah will still be aggressive. Sorry again...if you guys don&#39;t really mind not finishing the quest...awesome&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Dawnguard is almost finished, Haven&#39;t touched Companions, Dark Brotherhood, or Dragonborn (I&#39;ve been attacked by cultists though). College of Winterhold has been started due to main quest but I haven&#39;t talked to Mirabelle yet. I have a mod that introduces a new quest made from scratch, it&#39;s called Undeath and you start it at level 30. Beautifully done&#33; Check it out if you want. Thieves Guild is completely finished. If there is anything else I left..I&#39;m sorry. Dawnguard, Dragonborn, Hearthfire, and the latest skyrim update is on my save file so I suggest you get those if you truly want to experience what I am.\r<br />\r<br />Here is a list of mods that I use. I use a macbook pro for my Skyrim.

Anyway&#33;&#33; Tell me what you think&#33; You can critisize, I&#39;ll probably be crying with my pillow pet but no worries&#33; Upload pics of Tiger Lily or [insert name here]&#33; Change her up, change her hair, whatever you want&#33; I want to see what you think&#33; Thank you for even taking the time to check this out...this is the very first file I&#39;ve ever loaded..I don&#39;t create mods..but I wish I had the capability to do so. It is such an amazing skill to have. Thank you out there you authors, you make my life&#33; ^^",
