Take a look at it&#39;s description..\r<br />Hearthfires is fully supported, but not required.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=7][color=DarkOrange][b][u]Description[/u][/b][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />This is project that aims to overhaul all of skyrims sound.\r<br />It&#39;s main features are fixing all issues that bethesda left in, offering more options to configure the game sound, rebalancing/remixing all sounds, altering sound implementation, adding new sounds and variations, make me coffee....\r<br />I just wanted to create my own interpretation on how this game should sound. How to describe this? No idea.. I could tell you now that this mod makes the game sound more realistic, immersive, how advanced it is and that it&#39;s the biggest sound overhaul on the nexus  ...but screw that. Instead i give you a long and boring list of features.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=Red][b]This mod is currently in beta[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />The reasons for this are that there are still many things to add, balance, and i currently don&#39;t have much time for modding. If i wait until everything i want to do is implemented (which might never happen) it&#39;ll take several more month before i can release this mod.\r<br />But this is not about stability. The mod has been developed and tested for more than eight month, and everything implemented so far is working. (Except, well, every mod has some bugs, i guess..)\r<br />For further information see the Beta Info at the end of the modules description.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=DarkOrange][b]General Features[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] The mod is completely modular. All modules are designed to work independently from each other. Either the full version can be used, or a custom combination can be created as single file with Tes5Edit in less than 2 minutes.\r<br />[*] The master file can be used as resource for other mods providing new reverbs, output models and the MCM with it&#39;s sliders. The file itself does not require any dlcs.\r<br />[*] Other mods can make use of the menus sliders with simple patches. (see advanced info/patches)\r<br />[*] The mod is purely cosmetic and doesn&#39;t interfere with gameplay in any way.\r<br />[*] All used samples are either part of vanilla skyrim, or edits of them. (Despite from arguing about quality, this keeps the sound &#34;lore friendly&#34;)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=DarkOrange][b]Volume[/b][/color][/size] ...the essential question\r<br />We all know: this game is silent. Will this mod increase the volume? No. At least not that much it would be necessary..\r<br />Why not? Well, at first i have to point something out: I am not responsible for the silent game. The only tool i have to edit sound is the creation kit. But this issue is hidden somewhere deep in the gamecode, somewhere far beyond my skills.\r<br />But can&#39;t you increase volume in the ck? Yes, i could, but you should know that many sounds are already at full volume. If i start increasing it for the rest, i would sacrifice balance, get into mass editing of samples, and break compatibility for many sound mods. I will not do this...\r<br />\r<br />The good news: The rerouting of the sliders/sound categorys offers a volume increase between 10% and 20%, and the remix additionally increases volume by aprox. 3db/twice the volume (only footsteps and weapons fully support this right now). \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=7][color=DarkOrange][b][u]CONTENT[/u][/b][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=DarkOrange][b][u]Master File[/u][/b][/color][/size]\r<br />[size=2][b]Soundscape_Source.esm[/b][/size] This file loads the basic MCM, the bsa containing samples and the menu script, the .ini file containing some tweaks and any new records the modules depend on. The file itself it doesn&#39;t make any changes to the game, as well as the MCM has no available options until a module is installed.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][u]MCM[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />The mod has it&#39;s own Menu to configure the game-volume that is replacing the vanilla one.\r<br />The vanilla audio menu is unable to save the settings for more than 8 sliders. With the MCM more sliders than anyone needs can be saved, an by porting all vanilla-sliders (done by the core-module) in there offers room for other mods to use the previously occupied slots (like [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36312]this one[/url]).\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Vanilla and new sliders for volume and pitch. Sliders can be set in 1% steps instead of the 5% in the vanilla Audio-Menu.\r<br />[*] Buttons for muting sounds.\r<br />[*] The script will check for installed modules and won&#39;t do anything without them. Menu-functions will be available depending on the installed modules.\r<br />[*] Slider-settings can be saved and loaded again\r<br />[*] Ambient sounds (region/local sounds) will be muted during Map-/Skill-menus. This feature can be deactivated. (Some vanilla sounds are not affected by default and require the modules to be muted.)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />*NOTE: Pitch sliders seem a bit useless, because strong changes will ruin the game-sound. Nonetheless i added them, because i can... try out the voice-pitch&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][u]Samples[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />The samples are either samples with fixed issues that are overwriting vanilla ones, or new samples with unique filepath (referenced by the modules) so they don&#39;t alter the vanilla sounds or interfere with any sample replacers.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Changed vanilla samples:[/u]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Weapon-impact samples with removed silence. Some Weapon samples (blade on wood impact for example) had a bit of silence in front of the impact, resulting in a delay on the impact sound. This has been removed.\r<br />[*] Filtered the high/hurting frequencys of the blade vs other sample (is used as blade/axe vs metal when using the weapons module)\r<br />[*] Reduced volume on one netch-sample, to make it more equal with the second(silent) one. (Both are used by the same sound descriptor.)\r<br />[*] Shortened Hrtf catapult explosion to prevent the sample beeing cut off.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][u]Ini Tweaks[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Disabled main menu music. (After nearly 2 years playing skyrim, it gets annoying)\r<br />[*] Shortened fade in/out time if a menu is opened/closed.\r<br />[*] Smoother (longer) transition between reverbs. (to have less obvious changes on exterior reverbs)\r<br />[*] Dampening of sounds when the player is in dialogue-mode is more subtle than before.\r<br />[*] Disabled the highlighting of random dialogues which caused the volume of other dialogues to be lowered if a random dialogue (like a guard making a comment) is played. \r<br />[*] Experimental memory tweaks. These are not loaded by default and need to be activated manually by editing the file. (Unconfirmed if these are of any use at all. I&#39;ve included them in case somebody wants to try.)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />For details take a look inside the .ini-file. You&#39;re free to tweak the values to your liking.\r<br />*Keep in mind that this is always active as long as the masterfile is loaded, even without any of the modules. If you don&#39;t want this rename it to &#34;IHaveNoModWithThisNameActiveInMyLoadorder&#34;.ini or delete it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=DarkOrange][b][u]Modules[/u][/b][/color][/size]\r<br />The main reason for the seperation of modules is compatibility. Some mods, especially sound mods are conflicting in a way that can not be patched. Improved combat sounds is a good example. This mod has a completely different philosophy on how a game should sound. It&#39;s samples have a different character than bethesdas, and it can only work if these are not mixed together. But that&#39;s what a patch would do. So in order to not force people to choose between Project Soundscape and Improved Combat Sounds, one can just pick every module except Weapons, merge them into a single file and use it in combination with ICS.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=DarkOrange][b]Shared Content[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />is spread among the modules. reason: edits to sound descriptors\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Remix\r<br />[*] Changed sound for firebolts, arrows, (spider-/chaurus-)spit and addded sound to frost projectile. New samples are continous loops, the projectiles can be heard flying by.\r<br />[*] Sounds related to animations will pause during menu -&gt; weapons\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][u][b]Remix[/u][/b][/size] (I&#39;ll just call it that way)\r<br />More than 700 sounds (of 2000 sounds total) have been edited by hand. Most of it is currently part of the sounds-module, and will be split up into different modules over time.\r<br />*Part of the remix so far: Weapons (full), footsteps (full), animals, creatures, waters, fires, magic, static objects and some misc edits\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Included changes:[/u][/b]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Adjusted/changed volume, distance and pitch for sounds. (Volume and distance are based upon the &#34;size&#34; of the soundsource and the intensity of the sound instead of it&#39;s importance to gameplay.)\r<br />[*] Added/tweaked random pitch- and volume-variation for sounds.\r<br />[*] Adjusted &#34;reverb-strength&#34; to fit the intensity of the sound.\r<br />[*] Changed some sounds to be placed in the game world instead of &#34;in the players head&#34;, like firing crossbow, arrow impact, npcs casting magic, distant giant footsteps,...\r<br />[*] Removed alternate(generic) sounds that often played instead of the correct sounds. This has an effect on weapon impacts, footsteps and picking up items/ingredients.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Examples[/u][/b] (because i can&#39;t list every single change in detail..  similar changes are done to many sounds)\r<br />[*] Increased audible distance (and volume) for saw-/windmills, ship bells, hammering, dog barks, netch-loop, catapult impacts...\r<br />[*] Dragon sounds are brought in line with each other. Spoken words have adjusted range and attenuation. (It&#39;s now fun to listen to a distant dragon doing dragon-stuff.)\r<br />[*] Dwarven spiders can be heard as far as wolves instead of dwarven centurions. Their attacks will differ in frequency.\r<br />[*] &#34;Conscious-loops&#34; of dwarven-spiders and -spheres have slight frequency variation, so every one has it&#39;s &#34;unique&#34; frequency. (This is added to all creature- or object-loops so the brain identifies them as seperate soundsources)\r<br />[*] Creature death-sounds will not be be heard further/louder than the rest of the creatures sounds.\r<br />[*] When hitting a target with an arrow, the impact-sound will be played at the targets position instead of &#34;the players head&#34;.\r<br />[*] Nirnroot is more silent, but can be heard over a greater distance.\r<br />[*] Drawing and swinging weapons is not as loud as the impact anymore.\r<br />[*] Reverb on mammoths aggro-warning is louder, to support the feeling for it&#39;s distance.\r<br />[*] Less reverb on fires and water (to much reverb on sounds like these will clutter the soundscape with noise)\r<br />[*] Silt strider call is louder, but only plays half as often as before.\r<br />[*] Draugr-voices have a louder reverb than before. (For more scary-feelings..)\r<br />[*] A sabre-cats aggro warning can be heard in a distance outside of it&#39;s attacking-radius. But the footsteps might only be heard if it&#39;s already to late..\r<br />[*] Lowered frequency on dog barks to make them sound more like big dogs instead of a chihuahua.\r<br />[*] Reduced random volume on weapon impacts from 90% difference to 50%. Such big volume change makes sense if linked to impact-force (damage dealt for example), but not if it&#39;s completely random..\r<br />[*] Random bird-/cricket-noises increased in distance.\r<br />[*] ....\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=DarkOrange][b]Core[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />Does global changes to sound/sound processing as well as porting all vanilla sliders into the MCM.\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Increased audible distance in the output-models. Doubled radius and changed attenuation for smoother, more natural fadeout (see image). Some output-models have unique, even longer distances. (This is a global change and affects all sounds, independent from distance changes to single sounds.)\r<br />[*] Reduced the volume for &#34;defined speaker output&#34; (sounds that are not placed in the game world). This fixes many (known) issues with sounds beeing to loud like some magic sounds, ambient sounds, daedra voices, player footsteps (compared to 3rd person), potions and ingredients,....basically everything that used this kind of output before. (Take a look at [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/41982]this mod[/url] for further explanation.)\r<br />[*] Removed Vanilla sliders from the Audio-Settings-Menu and added them to the MCM. Sliders for killmoves and interface are added, too. (Those were fully functional and part of the vanilla game, but hidden by default.) As a side effect, some sliders allow to increase volume further than before.\r<br />[*] Reworked amount of sound &#34;send to reverb&#34; in the output-models. Increased reverb-volume for sounds that didn&#39;t use much, and lowered for sound that previously used to much. The room now will appropriately react to sound sources, instead of being either lazy or hysterical...\r<br />[*] All sounds except music now stop playing during loading menus.\r<br />[*] Focussed player/ingredient/potion sounds more on the front speakers, and ambient sounds more on the rear ones. This will have a slight effect on 2.0/2.1 setups, too. This will help seperating sound sources and prevent them from covering each other.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=DarkOrange][b]Weapons[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />blablablabla\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Remix of all melee and ranged weapon-sounds. Adds sliders for weapons to the MCM.\r<br />[*] Removed alternate weapon sounds, so the different impacts for surfaces/objects/npcs are used instead of the always same generic sound.\r<br />[*] Added impact-sounds that haven&#39;t been used by the game.\r<br />[*] Added variations of sounds to weapons-types that didn&#39;t use unique sounds for a specific material. (eg arrows/bolts will now play a metal-impact when hitting metal)\r<br />[*] Generally less random frequency and volume on weapon impacts. Similar weapon types have their own unique consistent frequency with subtle variation (eg all blade-sounds have similar pitch and volume, different from axes). If weapon-impacts shared the same sample/sound, the mod adds different sounds with unique frequency, instead of all using the same random frequency. (eg Shields or ice hit with a warhammer have a lower pitch than with a dagger)\r<br />[*] Weapon impacts will sparkle appropriatly depending on the objects material.\r<br />[*] Added new sample for flying arrows/bolts.\r<br />[*] Fixed too short arrow-impact distance.\r<br />[*] Edited bone and carpet material so arrows/bolts stick in them.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=DarkOrange][b]Footsteps[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />Bethesda didn&#39;t add the footstep sounds they created for the different armor types. Most of them are not used by the game that instead uses the sounds for no armor. Also some sounds are used only for the player, others only for npcs. The module adds the not used sounds to player and npcs, as well as it fixes some issues. \r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Remix of all human footstep-sounds. Adds slider for npc-footsteps to MCM.\r<br />[*] Unique footstep-sounds for Light Armor, Heavy Armor and no Armor for Player and NPCs.\r<br />[*] Npcs now use sneak-sounds instead of walking-sounds.\r<br />[*] Sprinting in skaal-armor has unique sounds only for the player. Npcs now use these, too.\r<br />[*] Added the missing player sounds for jumping up. Before jump up sounds in 3rdperson didn&#39;t properly switch to HRTF (instead they were played &#34;in the players head&#34;) as well as npc jump-sounds were not played on HRTF. Sound categorys (volume-sliders) are fixed too.\r<br />[*] Removed alternate footsteps/jump-sounds which were sometimes played instead of the correct ones.\r<br />[*] Changed material for some ground textures, to play appropriate sounds and add more frequent variation.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />*Note: The footstep-sounds are attached to the boot-records, not the cuirass, so the sound depends on the boots the player/npc is wearing. This is how the game handles footsteps for humans... changing this would require a lot of new samples, which i don&#39;t have.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=DarkOrange][b]Reverb[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />Skyrim by default uses only 7 different reverbs for all locations. Four sizes of stone rooms, two wooden rooms and ships. These are used by all types of interior locations, regardless their structure. Exterior areas use no reverb at all. Besides the fact that this has nothing to do with realism, it also doesn&#39;t build an atmospheric soundscape..\r<br />This module uses 40+ new unique sounding reverbs and spreads them across all interiors and many exterior areas. The default reverb is used for the areas not covered by the mod, so that the player always has the impression that there is some environment around him.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Changes[/u]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] All different types of interior locations (caves, dwemer ruins, catacombs, forts, mines,...) have their own reverbs with unique sound and variable sizes.\r<br />[*] Created a third reverb type for inhabitat rooms: While vanilla skyrim only has reverbs for wooden and stone rooms, many interiors are build of stone walls and wooden floors etc. These now use their own reverb (Early reflections are close to stone, decay closer to wood).\r<br />[*] Corrected many interior cells that used the wrong reverb (for example the jarls house in winterhold used large stone, but it actually is not that large and only has a stone floor..)\r<br />[*] Exterior reverbs (these are more like echoes) for all cities, city exteriors and villages (all dlcs) as well as High Hrothgar, Throat of the world (Path), Castle Volkihar and Fort Dawnguard (Dlc1), Temple of Miraak (Dlc2).\r<br />[*] Made use of the default reverb. If no reverb is referenced by a cell, this one will be used. This happens mainly in exterior areas. It&#39;s the most subtle of the exterior revebs.\r<br />[*] Missing reverb added to Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary and some other cells i&#39;ve forgotten.\r<br />[*] Unique reverbs for: Dragonsreach balcony, Blackreach, some glacier areas (the ones that used an acoustic space), Vyrthur (Dlc1), Volkihar Courtyard (Dlc1), Apocrypha (Dlc2), Telvanni Mushrooms Interior (Dlc2)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[u]The new reverbs can be classified in 4 different types:[/u]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Rooms, inhabitat by humanoids with lots of furnishings or carpets sucking up reverb: Medium reverb decay, medium early reflections\r<br />[*] Dungeons, empty closed rooms: Long reverb decay, strong early reflections\r<br />[*] Semi exteriors, opened caves for example. Reflecting surrounding walls but less capability to trap the sound: Medium reverb decay, strong early reflections\r<br />[*] Exteriors, only directly reflecting structures, no chance to trap sound at all: Short reverb decay, medium early reflections\r<br />[/list]\r<br />*Note: Music is masking the reverb. I recommend to disable it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=DarkOrange][b]Sounds[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />Contains all edits that are not part of a specific module yet.\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Remix of all sounds that are not part of the weapons or footsteps modules.\r<br />[*] During dialogue-mode only ambient- and static-object-sounds are lowered instead of most of the sounds around the player.\r<br />[*] Added new output models with bigger attenuation start radius.. the player needs to move further away from the object before it starts to get silent. This is mainly used for rivers/waterfalls (so the fadeout doesn&#39;t start when the player is still in the river)\r<br />[*] Removed alternate(generic) sounds for picking up items/ingredients.\r<br />[*] During menus ambient sounds get muted and objects loops play on (in vanilla it was the opposite).\r<br />[*] Enables the MCM to mute Nirnroot, Critical Hit-Sound, Soultrap, LevelUp and ActivateFail\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[b][u]Misc Changes[/u][/b]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Added missing sounds to flapping Banners.\r<br />[*] Added mammoth-footsteps from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24805]Better Animal Footsteps[/url]\r<br />[*] Added a sonar-like sound to Aura Whisper shout. The auras of npcs are not only visible anymore.. (can be disabled in the MCM)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=DarkOrange][b]Objects[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />This adds sounds to record types that allow adding them, for example moveable statics, doors and lights.\r<br />All used samples are edited versions of vanilla sounds.\r<br />The module has it&#39;s own volume slider.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Additional sounds added to:[/u]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Fires with large smoke trails (apperaing during the Japhets Folly- or Civil War Quests)\r<br />[*] Blackreach Mushrooms and Tentacles (the latter is only audible close to the point they touch the surface)\r<br />[*] Dwemer Lift\r<br />[*] Sewer Doors\r<br />[*] Night Mother Coffin (Only if player is &#34;the Listener&#34;)\r<br />[*] Windmill and Sawmill\r<br />[*] Volcanic Mineral Pools\r<br />[*] Nordic Aqueducts\r<br />[*] Dark Elf Lanterns (DLC2)\r<br />[*] Smoking shrubs and small flaming rocks (DLC2)\r<br />[*] Apocrypha Tentacle Clusters (DLC2)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=DarkOrange][b][u]Optional Modules[/u][/b][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=DarkOrange][b]Hearthfires[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />Does NOT require the main mod to work.\r<br />This file only reduces the volume of the wooden-sword sounds, removes generic weapon impact and increases audible distance on the workbench hammer, to adjust them to the remix. All in all just 4 records. For these i won&#39;t add another master-file to the main mod, so it&#39;s an optional file.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=DarkOrange][b]Armors[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />Does NOT require the main mod, but requires dawnguard and dragonborn. Can be merged into the bashed patch by WryeBash.\r<br />Should be loaded early in the load order (eg after the uskp), so other mods can overwrite changes if necessary.\r<br />Changes the footstep-sets used by the armors.\r<br />In the vanilla game every light armor is supposed to use footsteps-sounds for light armor, heavy armor uses heavy footsteps, and cloth uses default footsteps.. (actually, these are not always used correctly, but the uskp fixes these issues) While this is okay with the default footstep-sounds, it might get weird when using my footsteps module. Suddenly, iron-armor sounds like someone is carrying a bag of scrap-metal, and thieves- or dark brotherhood-armor sounds like chainmail. This plugin changes the used footstep-sounds for all armors, depending on the look/material of the armor instead of their category. For example thieves-armor and other leather-based armors will use the default footsteps, iron and steel use the light-armor/chainmail sounds (because no metal-plates are directly touching each other) and steelplate and ebony use the heavy/plate-sounds.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=DarkOrange][b]Shields[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />Same as above, but changing the impact sounds for light and heavy shields depending on material-look.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=Red][b]Beta Information[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Many sounds are still only roughly or not mixed at all. Due to the 2000+ sound descriptors this is a slow process. (Especially many quest-related sounds will need some time because they require a savegame with the specific quest active in order to test them ingame.)\r<br />[*] Waterfalls...to silent....i know.\r<br />[*] Only preset 1 is working and it&#39; just a demo.\r<br />[*] Increasing pitch to a value higher than 2.0 has no effect on most sounds.\r<br />[*] \r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />The sounds module is a temporary module and will be split up into seperate modules including new sliders. The objects-module might get merged into these.\r<br />Planned modules so far are:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Magic\r<br />[*] Creatures\r<br />[*] Environment (Static objects and ambient-sounds, including sounds from objects module)\r<br />[*] Interface\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[color=Red]If you want to use the master file as resource for your own mod, please keep in mind that some structural changes might be done during the beta, especially to sound categorys.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=DarkOrange][b]Issues[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] The Master-slider can&#39;t be removed from the vanilla audio-menu. Just leave it at full volume.\r<br />[*] Changes to pitch in the MCM only apply to sounds that start playing after the pitch-change is made. In other words, loops like fire and water will only be changed after the sound is stopped and restarted (for example by changing the cell)\r<br />[*] The default reverb is not loaded if a savegame in an exterior area is loaded. Enter and leave a interior cell to fix this.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Vanilla issues that the mod doesn&#39;t fix[/b][/u]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Dialogues often are not referencing the correct output model, making them often to loud or to silent over distance.\r<br />[*] Some objects/surfaces emit the wrong or no impact sounds (foosteps, weapons, etc).\r<br />[*] Many creature/npc animations are missing animation sounds.\r<br />[*] Many sound markers are missing in the game world. (Rivers, Waterfalls, Windmills,...)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=DarkOrange][b]Performance[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />As far as i can tell this mod has no impact on performance.\r<br />In theory some of the changes (removing generic sounds, adding new sounds) should increase memory usage, but it&#39;s a minor impact compared to texture replacers or armor mods. (All vanilla weapon samples loaded at the same time have a smaller impact/size than a single hd body-texture)\r<br />If any performance issues occur in your game, please report. Furthermore, the ini file has some lines that might help with memory issues.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=DarkOrange][b]Compatibility[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />Only really few mods on the nexus will have issues with this one. The majority of mods just use sound, they don&#39;t edit it. For the few conflicting popular mods i&#39;ll offer patches.\r<br />\r<br />Load this mod (the esps) after the uskp/early in the load order, and everything should be fine. Minor records might get overwritten (i don&#39;t know of mods that do), but thats no big deal.. eg if a record from the objects-module is conflicting, the sound attached to that object will not play, but the rest of the mod will still work. Things like this will NOT crash the game, damage your saves, make cows fly, let giant chickens rush into whiterun or anything else.. The worst that can happen is that something sounds odd..\r<br />I recommend (always) checking the loadorder for conflicts using Tes5Edit&#33;\r<br />\r<br />But there are things to be aware of:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] I assume you read the features of the mod carefully. A lot of sound-mods do similar things, for example mods that fix creature footsteps volume, mute sounds, reduce ambient volumes.. these mods in most cases are based on new/edited samples (have no esps). Remove these. My mod already deals with these issues, but in a more appropriate way.\r<br />[*] The same as above goes for &#34;sound-fix&#34; mods based on esps. All &#34;issues&#34; i know of are fixed by my mod (or my bugfix-mod). Most other mods are obsolete.\r<br />[*] The changes of the sound module done to Sound-Categorys and Output-Models should never be overwritten by any other mod&#33; This could break the menu functions or big parts of the sound. (luckily i don&#39;t know of any mods editing those)\r<br />[*] Mods that edit sound descriptors might break the routing. If a mod for example edits weapon-sound records, these sounds won&#39;t be controlled by the weapons-slider anymore. If a mod adds new sounds, they too might(&#33;) not use the correct sliders.. In both cases patching is required. (but only if these records actually are using new sliders&#33;)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />Again: If something like this happens, it will not crash the game or damage savegames&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Always compatible:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Every mod that does not edit sound.\r<br />[*] Sample-replacing mods (without esp) will work fine, as long as the new samples have similar volume.\r<br />[*] Music mods. My mod does not touch music-records.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />If someone finds some mods having issues with this one, please report. I can&#39;t check compatibility for each of the 40000 mods available.\r<br />If you are not familiar with modding, have questions about compatibility or patching, or anything else, just ask&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][color=DarkOrange][b]Load Order[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />The mods files do not require a specific load order compared to each other, but the Source-file needs to be loaded first (because it&#39;s a .esm). This might be usefull especially when looking at compatibility.\r<br />Patches always need to be loaded after the mods and modules they&#39;re patching.\r<br />\r<br />Considering other mods load order compared to this mod:\r<br />I don&#39;t know&#33; Creating a working load order is the responsibility of the user, and the only usefull things that ensure a conflict and crash free gaming experience are Tes5Edit and Brain (the thing inside your skull). Every individual load order is unique.....................\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=DarkOrange][b]Installation[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />Use your favorite mod manager to install, or install manually (Copy all files into skyrim/data)\r<br />Check plugins you want active and start the game.\r<br />*After installation start the game and make a new savegame. Then quit the game, restart it and load the new save. Changes to outputmodels sometimes don&#39;t work on first load..\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b][u]First Startup[/u][/b][/size]\r<br />The mod will start with all sound categorys using their vanilla volume. You can either start adjusting the sliders to your preferences, or load one of the presets.\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=DarkOrange][b]Uninstallation[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />Use the mod manager to uninstall, or remove files manually. The mod/scripts don&#39;t make any permanent changes, no special procedure is required.\r<br />*If you&#39;re not comfortable with removing scripted mods, or want to temporary uninstall the mod, remove the esps and keep the esm in the load order. Without modules the scripts won&#39;t do anything on game load and no settings will be lost.\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=DarkOrange][b]Updating[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />Just uninstall old version and install new one. Do NOT make a cleansave or your settings will be lost&#33;\r<br />Some future updates might reset the settings. To be save, make screenshots of them before updating. But i&#39;ll put up a notification if this is necessary.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=7][color=DarkOrange][b][u]Advanced Information[/u][/b][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=DarkOrange][size=5][b]Basic Knowledge[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.creationkit.com/Reverb_Parameters]Skyrims Reverb[/url] and [url=http://audacity.sourceforge.net/manual-1.2/effects_reverb.html]Reverb[/url] in common\r<br />[url=http://www.creationkit.com/Sound_Output_Model]Output Model[/url], explains defined speaker output, [url=http://www.tech-faq.com/hrtf.html]HRTF[/url] and reverb send\r<br />[url=http://www.creationkit.com/Sound_Descriptor]Sound Descriptor[/url], explains alternate(generic) sounds\r<br />[url=http://www.creationkit.com/Sound_Category]Sound Category[/url] (Slider)\r<br />[url=http://www.creationkit.com/Acoustic_Space]Acoustic Space[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=DarkOrange][b]How the MCM/Scripts work[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />*shorten\r<br />[size=5][color=DarkOrange][b]Audio Hardware[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />I recommend solid audio hardware, best are quality headphones (if playing on speakers, the room the player is sitting in in most cases willl interfere with the game sound and suck up details)\r<br />I&#39;ll put it that way: i know a lot of people that own expensive computers with high end GPUs, but use small desktop speakers or cheap hifi-headphones combined with an onboard sound-device... we don&#39;t have to talk about good game sound or sound mods with a setup like this. It&#39;s not that this mod won&#39;t work on these, but most of the details will be lost. In fact it&#39;s impossible to hear most of the details already present in the vanilla game with low-end hardware.\r<br />I made this mod as well as i play this game with studio-quality headphones and sound-interface. I can hear every little bit of the sound at a good volume.. so please, if you want good game sound, go out and invest some money in quality hardware. The difference is huge, and no modder can compensate that by editing values in the CK or replacing samples. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=DarkOrange][b]Merging Modules[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />For people who like to use their own combination of modules, but don&#39;t want to load many plugins, this mods files can be easily merged into one file using Tes5Edit. In theory all main modules, optional files and patches can be merged together, but i&#39;d recommend to at least merge the patches into a seperate file for load order reasons.\r<br />*Do not merge the master file&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Beginners:\r<br />Take a look at [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/904953-how-to-merge-multiple-mods-with-multiple-master-files/]this[/url] guide how to merge mods in general.\r<br />For this mod it works exactly the same way, but with two exceptions:\r<br />- You don&#39;t need to renumber the form-id&#39;s. If you follow the guide, skip pictures 3-6.\r<br />- You don&#39;t need to continue after adding the masterfiles. Picture 11 is the last one for this mod. (It will not ask you to add one of the esps as master..)\r<br />\r<br />Advanced users:\r<br />The modules don&#39;t have any new records included. This makes merging extremely simple, because one can ignore the whole issue on duplicated form id&#39;s.\r<br />Load all wanted modules with Tes5Edit. Use &#34;copy as override&#34; or &#34;deep copy as override&#34; (makes no difference) to copy the group tabs into a new file and save. Done.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=DarkOrange][b]Creating Patches[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />How to create patches for mods adding or editing sounds to work with the MCM&#39;s sliders, with or without my modules.\r<br />*not completed yet\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=DarkOrange][b]Compatibility List[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*] Ambient Seagulls - Compatible\r<br />[*] Better Animal Footsteps - Incompatible/ Will be partially merged - Samples have their own balance that is conflicting with the remix\r<br />[*] Better Weapon Swings - Compatible\r<br />[*] Clanking Armor - Obsolete with Footsteps-Module\r<br />[*] Climates of Tamriel - Compatible\r<br />[*] Climates of Tamriel Sounds - Conflicting with sounds-module, patch available - New sounds don&#39;t use the correct slider\r<br />[*] Enhanced Blood Textures - Conflicting with weapons-module, patch available\r<br />[*] Falskaar - Compatible *Optional Patch available\r<br />[*] FSS Better Bards - Compatible\r<br />[*] Helgen Reborn - Compatible\r<br />[*] Icebreakers Improved Reverb - Incompatible with reverb-module\r<br />[*] Immersive Sounds Magic v1- Compatible, but don&#39;t use esp (this hinders magic sounds used by npcs to be played on hrtf)\r<br />[*] Immersive Thunder - Compatible\r<br />[*] Improved Combat Sounds - Incompatible with weapons-module\r<br />[*] Improved Dragon Shouts - Compatible\r<br />[*] Improved Horse Step Sounds - Conflicting with sound-module, patch available\r<br />[*] Improved Weapon Impact Effects Correct Metal - Similar changes included in Weapons-module\r<br />[*] Muffle the Nirnroots/Nirnroots silenced - Obsolete\r<br />[*] Moonpath to Elsweyr - Compatible *Optional patch available\r<br />[*] Pure Waters - Compatible\r<br />[*] Realistic Water Two - Conflicting with reverb- and sounds-module, patches available\r<br />[*] Roosters at dawn - Compatible\r<br />[*] Silent Skyrim - Partially included\r<br />[*] Soultrap Sound Edit Calm Wind - Compatible\r<br />[*] Sounds of Skyrim - Conflicting with reverb-module, Patch Available\r<br />[*] Thundering Shouts - Compatible\r<br />[*] Ultra Realistic Crossbow Shoot Sounds - Incompatible with weapons-module, similar changes included\r<br />[*] Unofficial Skyrim/Dawnguard/Hearthfire/Dragonborn Patch - Compatible\r<br />[*] Water - Compatible\r<br />[*] Wyrmstooth - Compatible, optional reverb patch available\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=DarkOrange][b]Recommended Mods[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31039]Improved Horse Step Sounds[/url] (use patch)\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1117]Smooth blade draw and Sheathe[/url]  - Scabbards are not made of stone&#33;\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27208]Ultra Realistic Bow Shoot Sounds[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][color=DarkOrange][b][u]Patches[/u][/b][/color][/size]\r<br />[color=red]If no further information is given, always load the soundscape_source.esm first and the patches after the mods they&#39;re patching.[/color]\r<br />*Patches that are adding new sounds/edited sounds from another mod to one of the MCM-Sliders can be used without my modules&#33; The slider will be activated and the sounds can be controlled by it.\r<br />*The version info behind the mods name means that patches were created with this version of the mod.
