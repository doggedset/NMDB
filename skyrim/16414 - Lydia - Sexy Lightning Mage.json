  "descriptionHtml": "I figured it was time to get a follower who could fling the odd bit of magic about as well as swing a blade, and since I can\\'t bear the thought of being parted from my beloved Lydia, I\\'ve tweaked her a bit to add some spells, perks and magic buffs.\r\n\r\nThis version of the Lid has -\r\n\r\nLightning Bolt\r\nSparks\r\nConjure Familiar\r\nHealing\r\nHealing Hands\r\nConjuration Dual Casting\r\nConjuration/Destruction/Restoration all perked to master level.\r\n\r\nThe Dark Lillith boots, costume and gloves have been buffed to provide additional armor and magic/magic regen. I\\'ve kept Lydia\\'s combat style/aggression the same, although now she can use spells, she does seem to employ a modicum of intelligence in her attacks! I don\\'t think I\\'ve overpowered her too much, but the Dremora Lord doesn\\'t get out much these days.\r\n\r\nESSENTIAL PATCHES/MODS\r\n\r\nCalientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\n\r\nDark Lillith Sexy Succubus Armor\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13067\r\n\r\nKNOWN ISSUES\r\n\r\nCan\\'t think of any, other than that when you load the mod for the very first time, and go into the game, Lydia will be wearing whatever her default/last set of armor was - just do a quick trade with her (take a shield or weapon off her) and she should instantly swap to the more appealing armor set (you don\\'t have to go get the Dark Lillith armor, it\\'s part of her inventory). Moving to another cell will also have the same effect. Then she should stay in her gear permanently. \r\n\r\nI think that about covers it.\r\n\r\nKudos and much appreciation for these two authors and their fab modifications, upon which sit my rather feeble tweaks -\r\n\r\nDark Lilith Sexy Succubus Armor CBBE NKT by Nikitaa\r\n\r\nCalientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition -CBBE- by Caliente\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
