  "descriptionHtml": "So this little program allows you to easily create a random character for roleplay including randomly generated race, skills, profession and traits. You can easily re-roll if you don&#39;t like anything you are given and you may save your characters stats to a .txt file if you wish to have a list of different builds you like. This way you can keep a record just in case&#33;Â \r<br />\r<br />I have plans of adding in allegiances, descriptions for the traits and professions as well as a list of mods that would suit the different professions for improved roleplay and general gameplay.\r<br />\r<br />If you encounter any bugs or would like me to add something please let me know.",
