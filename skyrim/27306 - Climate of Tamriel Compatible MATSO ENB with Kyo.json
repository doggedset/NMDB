  "descriptionHtml": "After many hours of tweaking parameters in enbseries.ini. enbeffectprepass.fx, and enbbloom.fx using the fantastic files created by MATSO and Kyo I have made this brilliant ENB work nicely without having to remove Climates of Tamriel.\r\n\r\nThe days are crisp, sunny with great sun rays and bloom.  The nights are not too dark that you need a torch, except deep in the forrest on a cloudy night.  The dungeons are creepy and a torch is sometimes needed.  Indoors the shadows have detail, and the lighting gives of flare.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve made a magical version as I found the drab colours in vanilla quite depressing at time, and have also made a less saturated version.\r\n\r\nThese files will utilize hexagonal bokeh with weightclaming, anamorphic lens flare, bloom, and DOF with a reasonable depth so as to not blur too much up close.  I\\'ve turned off SSAO for better performance, but it can be easily turned back on.  I tend to use the nvidia driver SSAO as I don\\'t like how the water becomes transparent with the ENB version.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
