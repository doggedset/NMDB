  "modName": "Archmage Robes and Boots have Armor",
  "summary": "I decided to do a sneakthief playthrough, but I realized that the best robes for me had no armor. I even got a cool retexture and everything. So, I whipped this up in about three minutes.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I edited the values of the Boots, Archmage\\'s Robes, and Archmage\\'s Robes (hooded) to have them be Light Armor. The armor offered isn\\'t much, but\\'s it armor. I\\'m going to play around with it a little more in the coming days. I think it should have upgrades enabled, but I\\'m not sure. I\\'ll update this mod soon, I just wanted to get it out.\r\n\r\nThe Boots from the Archmage category are renamed to Archmage Boots. I may add \\\"\\'s\\\" later.\r\n\r\nThis is fully compatible with any retexture. I recommend [url=\\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6034\\\"]Let\\'s Get Psiijical[/url] by jdformanek, as it looks quite good.",
