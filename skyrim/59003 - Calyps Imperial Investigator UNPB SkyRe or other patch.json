  "descriptionHtml": "This patch basically changes Calyps&#39;s Imperial Investigator armor from the &#39;Investigator&#39; custom material to the &#39;Imperial Studded&#39; material type. That means it should be compatible with any mod setup you have, including Skyrim Redone as all it will do will change the armor values of the armor to your game&#39;s &#39;Imperial Studded&#39; armor type. Body type is UNPB which is required, but UNP body should work as well.\r<br />\r<br />HOWEVER, the armor value will still be fucked up if you didn&#39;t use your ReProccer correctly with Skyrim Redone or w/e compatibility patch to edit &#39;Imperial Studded&#39; armor material type. Basically if your Imperial Studded Armor armor value is fucked, your Imperial Investigator armor value will change to that fucked up value and will not fix it. But if you fix your &#39;Imperial Studded&#39; armor value then it will also fix your investigator armor with this patch. :)\r<br />\r<br />This mod also gives the armor a chance of appearing in stores wherever light armor is sold. The hat and cloak may also be available in clothes stores. Does not change crafting recipes or anything else about the armor.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve tested this with my ReProced SkyRe setup but not any other setups. However I&#39;m 99% certain it should work as outlined with any setup, as it just changes the armor material type. But feel free to post if you have any issues.\r<br />\r<br />[b]REQUIRES[/b]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19377/]CALYPS&#39; IMPERIAL INVESTIGATOR ARMOR[/url]\r<br />AND\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6709/]UNP[/url] [i]-OR-[/i] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6709/?]UNPB[/url] \r<br />\r<br />FULL CREDIT \r<br />Goes to [u]Calyps[/u] for the armor, Dimonized for UNP, and xp32 for UNPB.\r<br />\r<br />I also highly reccomend DreamBurrows&#39; retexture for the armor too.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19377/]DREAMBURROW&#39;S RETEXTURES[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Install instructions[/b]\r<br />Use a mod manager and install.
