  "descriptionHtml": "I do know that there are mods that remove salt from the ingredients required list for food and that there are also mods that add more salt to the game, and even a salt mine has come to light recently... however I wanted a choice as to whether I have salt or not so I left the vanilla list complete and created new recipes to run alongside for those who have a salt allergy or just plain ran out of the stuff through shortsightedness.\r<br />There is a slight downside though, all unsalted cooked meat or &#39;Bland Food&#39; as I prefer to call it only restores 5 points of health instead of the Vanilla 10.\r<br />Weights for Beef 0.5 (as vanilla)\r<br />small meats  0.2 (Rabbit, Salmon etc)\r<br />all others 1.0 in weight\r<br />\r<br />So for those that are still confused, if you have beef and salt... then cook it, if however you have beef but no salt... then still cook it, Auntie would.",
