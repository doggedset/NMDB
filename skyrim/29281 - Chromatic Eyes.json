  "descriptionHtml": "I am not an expert on photoshop and at first I made these eyes just for myself. So this mod may be not so perfect , but I\\'ve tried my best to make it look not so bad.\r\n\r\nThere are 12 pairs of new eyes added in the mod ,no replacement.\r\nAll of the eyes are colorful and non-lore-friendly.\r\n\r\nThe textures of the eyes are of  high definition,so it is possible to cause CTD if your PC is not good enough or you have too many mods loaded.\r\n\r\nThe eyes are available just for human races at present. If they are required by other races I will set it in future versions.\r\n\r\nSome more colors will be added in future versions as well, maybe,it depends on whether this mod is accepted :)\r\n\r\nAnd finally ,everyone is permitted to use this mod anywhere whitout asking me .It would be better if you like it :). Have fun with Skyrim.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo install and to uninstall : just use NMM or copy the files and put them into the data file manually",
