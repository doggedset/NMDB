What can i say &#33;\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i1066.photobucket.com/albums/u408/sugarbabe9111/RDTLogoKnownIssues.png[/img]\r<br />- There&#39;s a bug in vanilla that make the mannequins move when you enter a cell, if the mannequins are not to the correct position, exit the cell and reenter will fix it &#33;\r<br />- The dread armor (lichking female) doesn&#39;t have a weight slider.\r<br />- The dread sorceress robe doesn&#39;t have a weight slider.\r<br />- Some of the gauntlets are clipping a lil.\r<br />- It&#39;s possible that after sending your dogs home that they just wander around, let them be they will eventually respawn at the forge and be ready to follow you again.\r<br />- Some ppl reported the exterior tower not showing 100% of the time, that is cause by an issue with any new added LOD mesh to the game... Bethesda has not look into this yet &#33; For now the mesh is set to &#34;Full LOD&#34;, nothing more i can do at the momment &#33;\r<br />- There&#39;s an invisible colision geometry outside the tower (unless you are using a flying mod this will not effect your game play). It&#39;s possible to correctly land on the tower roof whitout any issue.\r<br />\r<br />If you find any please let me know via PM.
