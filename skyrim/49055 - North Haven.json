Universal Dead Storage & Storage systems - The Universal Dead Storage is the werewolf statue in the center of the entrance also in the Artillery Room also the rooms under the waterfall and other player homes that have small gargoyle statue throughout North Haven it will link all to 1 chest  so you don&#39;t have to run to that same chest every time eventually i will add 1 on the boat before you go to North Haven. Other storage&#39;s like the one&#39;s near your dresser in the bedroom - for example if you want to drop your armor or gem stones,dragon bones etc you will find them also in the outdoor bedroom as well as the one in the Artillery Room, all 3 will connect together separately for each container.\r<br />\r<br />[COLOR=#548DD4]StoryLine:[/COLOR] After the battles in Skyrim you return home where you are crowned Lord Of The Dead.
