It does this by assigning different forts different textures. The result is that most of Skyrim's forts have a unique variation on textures, instead of the same textures being used for every single fort. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]The mod started off as a small personal project because I hated the fact that there was moss growing on forts way in the north of Skyrim, since they it's expanded a bit more. The texture placement of forts follows a simple bit of logic: 'Is it realistic?' Meaning you won't find any moss or plants on textures that are in snowy/icy areas. In addition forts in the snowy northern depths of Skyrim now actually look like they belong there. Some have icy decals, others have a frozen appearance. This makes sense, likely nothing green can grow very well in these areas. There are exceptions were it makes sense like along the border where the snow stops. Forts not in snowy areas have their location taken into account as well. Forts in the forests of Skyrim have green moss and plants growing on them. Forts in the Tundra and Rift also suit their location. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]This mod includes textures from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/43107/?]Vivid Landscapes - Imperial Forts[/url], [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45807/?]Noble Skyrim HD[/url], [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26269/?]Langey's Texture Workshop[/url], [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61995/?]Tamirel Reloaded[/url],  plus a few of my own. Hein84, Shutt3r, Langey, and 32cm were nice enough to let me use their textures. They are awesome. Please if you have downloaded their work consider endorsing/saying thanks/donating to them. Cabal120's [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49710/]aMidianBorn Imperial Forts[/url] is also required for this mod, but not provided in the download, so credits to Cabal120 as well for more awesome textures. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][u]What's finished:[/u] [/size][size=4]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]23 Forts in Skyrim have been customized with new textures[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]6 Imperial Towers have been customized with new textures[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Integration with[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51188/?] No Snow Under The Roof[/url] (This means it's required)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3](Optional) Parallax Meshes[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3](Optional) UV Scaled Meshes (1.5 scaling on bricks, 2.0 scaling on moss, this is a personal taste as any higher looks too 'cookie cutter')[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Optimization of texture sets[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Cleaned and checked for errors with Tes5Edit[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Removed moss from all Snow/Ice Fort meshes[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Correct LODs for new texture sets (this was a chore)[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]\n<br />[/size][size=3][u]What's not finished (in order of priority):[/u] \n<br />\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Forts from Dragonborn DLC.

This is totally 100% his call and I respect his decision, as should you. Don't ask or complain about this. \n<br />\n<br />Q: [i]Wait, so if [/i][i]aMidianBorn's textures aren't included... how do you get proper LODs?\n<br />[/i]A: In a word: Texgen. In more than one word, sheson is very clever. \n<br />\n<br />Q: [i]Why is No Snow Under The Roof required?! I don't like it. [/i]\n<br />A: Too bad, it's a great mod and there's no reason not to have it. It doesn't impact performance, makes snow actually look real, and if you don't like then sorry, but 12500 endorses shows that the vast majority do like it.\n<br />\n<br />Q: [i]Why is DynDOLOD required? [/i]\n<br />A: It's not strictly required, but if you want LODs to show up correctly it is required. \n<br />\n<br />Q:[i] Is this compatible with ModX?[/i]\n<br />A: Mostly likely yes. But ask yourself, does ModX modify vanilla forts in anyway? Then it might not be. Tes5Edit can quickly check if another mod is touching forts. Otherwise feel free to ask. \n<br />\n<br />Q: [i]Will this destroy my save/PC/Life/Lore Friendliness/Lore Unfriendliness/childhood dreams?\n<br />[/i]A: No on all counts. \n<br />\n<br />[i]Q: Why is there no parallax on the snow/ice forts?! I looked at your meshes and parallax isn't even enabled?![/i]\n<br />A: Objects with shaders applied to them (snow) can't have the parallax effect. \n<br />\n<br />[i]Q: Why aren't there more screenshots?! I want to see what the mod looks like. [/i]\n<br />A: I intentionally didn't add many because I want the look of the forts to be a surprise.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Q: LODs don't match the full models![/i]\n<br />A: Are you using DynDOLOD 2.11 or higher? Did you install the 'Edit Scripts' provided with this mod to DynDOLOD?, Did you run TexGen while having Spice of Life Forts active in your load order? Did you install DynDOLOD/TexGen output(s)? \n<br />\n<br />Q: Will you create a version that keeps moss on the Snow/Ice forts?\n<br />A: No. \n<br />[/size]\n<br />[u][size=5]Donations:[/size]\n<br />[/u][size=3]Please do no donate to me. I don't want anything for my mods. This mods uses so much of other people's work it isn't morally right to take money for it.
