  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i.imgur.com/GrHCYbT.jpg[/img]\r<br />This mod simply adds the Famous Iron Throne from the TV show &#39;Game of Thrones&#39; into Skyrim. It can be found in The Palace of the Kings in Windhelm. It works with the Aliases and Packages, so basically, Ulfric will use it like it were the old one. I know it&#39;s not exact but its as much like the real one as I could possibly make it to be.\r<br />\r<br />To sit on it yourself, Ulfric will need to be off it. Hover your cursor over one of the banners until the option to sit on it appears.\r<br />Just extract the files to your Data folder and all should go well. This mod will not be compatible with any mod that alters with the throne in the Palace of the Kings. Ask for my Permission if you want to use this in a mod.\r<br />\r<br />SCREENSHOTS:\r<br />Armor is medusa drakul armors, by [b]Zerofrost Satyr[/b]\r<br />Various HD texture mods\r<br />\r<br />A special thanks to:\r<br />Google Images\r<br />Joffrey Baratheon\r<br />Bethesda",
