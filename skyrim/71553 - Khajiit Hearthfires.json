  "summary": "Provides a build-your-own alternative for the nomadic Khajiit.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The other races have homes that they can build, either from the DLC Hearthfires itself, or my [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64038]Orc Hearthfires[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69061]Argonian Hearthfires[/url] mods. However, Khajiit are a special case, because they&#39;d rather live a nomadic life than settle in one location. So if they build a home, it will be - a wagon&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This mod does exactly that. It provides the ability to make your own wagon, drive it, and sleep in it. You don&#39;t have to be playing a Khajiit to use this, but I think they&#39;ll appreciate it more than the other races.\r<br />\r<br />Before you can build the wagon, you&#39;ll need the appropriate tools, and a place to build it. There is a quest to recover a set of tools, and a location that will become a workshop (and home to the crafting stations you can&#39;t carry around). Plus a recurring quest will add a bit of action. \r<br />\r<br />More details can be found [url=http://ghastley.org/Skyrim/Docs/KhajiitHearthfires.html]here.[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Grits for the testing, and to Mojo, the character who built the wagon multiple times until I got it right.\r<br />Thanks to the entire community at the Bethsoft forums, who helped me get around the quirks of the game and make the wagon work.",
