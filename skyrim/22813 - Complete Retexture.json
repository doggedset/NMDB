  "descriptionHtml": "I\\'m Re-texturing the whole game to make it look better. Right now it is just the steel armor and weapons as-well as the first crossbow you get. I\\'m working on leather next then daedric then dragonbone and scale. I will do Armor and Weapons then items such as potions rings and amulets etc.\r\n\r\nTo install extract the file into your data folder if you don\\'t have a texture folder if you do then extract my file somewhere else and add what you don\\'t already have folder wise the actual stuff is the .dds but it wont work unless you have the folders the way i just stated. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy as this is going to take a bit but don\\'t let that stop you from getting it now i will upload updates as frequently as possible.",
