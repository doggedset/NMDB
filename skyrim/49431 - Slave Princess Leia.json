  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://reaver.5gbfree.com/images/description.jpg[/img]\r<br />This mod provides two original costumes for Skyrim, based on the &#34;Slave Leia&#34; outfit from Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. \r<br />\r<br />[img]http://reaver.5gbfree.com/images/location.jpg[/img]\r<br />Like every other crime, Skyrim has slave traders lurking about its shadows. Many are in the employ of the Imperial legion. It is customary that all slaves be sold donned only in rags and prisoner sack-cloth, and be clothed later by their masters. It was at Helgen, that the Imperials once sold a special type of slave--those educated in the pleasures of men. To keep up with them, handlers always dressed them in a special type of attire. If you wish to wear the same garments, you will find the last 2 sets in the prisoner hold deep inside Helgen Keep.  \r<br />\r<br />[img]http://reaver.5gbfree.com/images/installation.jpg[/img]\r<br />Unrar the archive and place in &#34;Data&#34; folder. If you have any conflicts or issues with any aspect of your game upon installing this mod, please uninstall using the same method, but backwards.\r<br />\r<br />Please be aware this outfit is compatible ONLY with a UNP-type skin textures such as [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30181/?]Navetsea UNP[/url],  [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32986/?]Mature Skin[/url], etc. The outfit is not for CBBE, Pandora, and Ladybody-type bodies, as they use a different UV to map their textures.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://reaver.5gbfree.com/images/credits.jpg[/img]\r<br />I wish to thank my fellow artist [url=http://www.philc.net/freestuff_archive.php]Phil C[/url], for his gorgeous 3d model of Princess Leia in her Slave girl attire. This makes the 3rd rendition of the sultry Star Wars siren to be posted here at Nexus. One was done by Sorajmoe & jclyde6108 for UNP. The 1st was done by Neovinci for CBBE. Theirs&#39; have long loin skirts. Ours has cute little Leia booties. \r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://reaver.5gbfree.com/images/permissions.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />You may not upload, or distribute any parts of this Skyrim mod without the expressed permission of myself and any other authors who may have contributed to the creation of this mod. We are all, however, pretty good guys, so ask in PM if you want to do something public with anything you see here.
