The effects are: darker dungeons and crypts, darker interiors when NPCs are asleep and NPCs with torches. \r\n\r\n[center][size=7][color=#ff9900]Updates since last release (0.534):[/color][/size][/center] \r\n\r\n[list] \r\n\r\n[size=5][color=#ff9900]0.536, 2 January 2012:[/color][/size] \r\n\r\n[*]Tweak: NPCs will drop their torch only when in combat and will pick it up again after combat. \r\n\r\n[*]New feature: SkyUI\\'s MCM (Mod Config Menu) support. The configuration tool is a separate download from my mod\\'s Nexus files section. It requires Sky UI\\'s beta 3 version or better which can be downloaded from Sky UI\\'s thread in Bethesda\\'s official Skyrim mods forum: http://forums.bethsoft.com/forum/183-skyrim-mods/ \r\n\r\n[*]Tweak: Better handling of While...EndWhile loops when the game first loads or when the mod is uninstalling. \r\n\r\n[/list] \r\n\r\n[center][size=7][color=#ff9900]Updating[/color][/size][/center] \r\n\r\n[list=1] \r\n\r\n[*]Simply deactivate and uninstall the previous version then install and activate this version. \r\n\r\n[*]If you have Sky UI\\'s MCM, you can check the settings in Sky UI\\'s MCM wihtin the game. \r\n\r\n[*]Or check the settings in \\\"Data\\\\Ini\\\\kuerteeDisableLightsFarFromActors.ini\\\". If you change any of it, execute your changes by typing {bat \\\"ini\\\\kuerteeDisableLightsFarFromActors.ini\\\"} (without the brackets) in the console. \r\n\r\n[*]After the update is finished, the message \\\"kuDLFFA v0.536\\\" will appear. \r\n\r\n[/list] \r\n\r\n[center][size=7][color=#ff9900]Gameplay changes[/color][/size][/center] \r\n\r\nWhen the player enters an interior cell, the mod will disable lights that are 1500 units (by default) or more distant from NPCs. Lights found near NPCs that are sleeping are also disabled. You can change this value by setting userDisabledDistanceFromActor. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this process is not instantanous and you will see lights \\\"blink\\\" off. This effect is minimised by not disabling lights near the player. The effect is that the area near the entrance of an interior cell will be lit compared to those further in the dungeon. You can change this behaviour and let these lights be disabled as well by setting userDisableLightsNearPlayer to False. \r\n\r\nAlso, note that the \\\"fake\\\" lights that map developers add to the map and not the \\\"decorative\\\" lights (e.g. candles, wall torches) that most don\\'t actually cast light. Therefore, you will see these decorative lights and their glow even if the area around them is not lit. This is not as jarring as it sounds. If you like, you can disable these decorative lights as well by setting userDisableLightFixtures to True. \r\n\r\nOnce disabled, lights are not enabled again - until you exit the interior cell or uninstall the mod. What this means is that actors may move into the darkened areas of the map. The mod addresses this by giving NPCs a torch which the actor\\'s unmodded AI will use. The mod adds to this AI by getting actors with a torch in hand to drop it on the ground if they equip a weapon. \r\n\r\n[center][size=7][color=#ff9900]Details[/color][/size][/center] \r\n\r\nThe mod works by finding lights when an interior cell is entered. \r\n\r\nAny lights found are checked against FindClosestActorFromRef (). If the actor doesn\\'t have the ActorTypeNPC keyword, or is asleep or dead, the light is disabled. \r\n\r\nThe mod keeps a record of all lights found. And those that are disabled are reenabled when the player exits that interior cell or when the mod is uninstalled. Note that you have to uninstall the mod by following the uninstall instructions. Otherwise, any lights that were disabled will forever stay disabled in your game. \r\n\r\nYou can configure this mod with SkyUI\\'s MCM or in the Console by typing \\\"SetPQV kuDLFFAQ {mod data} {value}\\\".Below are the various mod data that you can change, their default values and a short description of their effects. \r\n\r\nuserDisabledDistanceFromActor 1500 \r\n\r\nLights this far away from actors are disabled. \r\n\r\nuserDisableLightsNearPlayer False \r\n\r\nBecause you will see the lights \\\"blink\\\" off, setting this to False prevents lights near you from turning off. When False, the effect is that the lights near the entrance on an interior cell will always be on. \r\n\r\nuserDisableLightFixtures False Decorative lights (e.g. candles and torches) and their glow will still be visible even after the actual light nearby has been turned off. Set this to True so that these decorative lights are also disabled. Having this as False is simply a preference of mine. I don\\'t find it jarring seeing these decorative lights even when they don\\'t cast any. \r\n\r\nuserUseInInnsAndStores True \r\n\r\nYou can elect to disable this mod in locations tagged with the keyword LocTypeInn or LocTypeStore. Again, this as True is simply a preference of mine. I like seeing parts of an inn that are not occupied or when sneaking into a store in the middle of the night when their owners are in bed to be in the dark. \r\n\r\nuserUseInPlayerHouse True \r\n\r\nYou can elect to disable this in player houses tagged with the keyword LocTypePlayerHouse. Again, a preference. I like seeing the house dark until I move someone inn. E.g. Breezehome looks more welcoming when the lights are on due to the house carl taking up residence. \r\n\r\nA configuration file (data\\\\ini\\\\kuerteeDisableLightsFarFromActors.ini) is provided with the relevant console commands. If you want to change any of the default values above, change them in the INI file then run the file by typing {bat \\\"ini\\\\kuerteeDisableLightsFarFromActors.ini\\\"} (without the brackets) in the console. You only need to do this when you want to change the values of the properties. Your changes will be saved in your game. \r\n\r\n[center][size=7][color=#ff9900]Install[/color][/size][/center] \r\n\r\n[list=1] \r\n\r\n[*]Use Wrye Bash (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=1840) to install this mod. Just drag the package (which is a normal ZIP file) into Wrye Bash\\'s Installers tab. However, the package is only a normal ZIP file, so if you know the game\\'s mod file structure, install it manually. \r\n\r\n[*]Change your settings within the game in Sky UI\\'s MCM or check the settings in \\\"Data\\\\Ini\\\\\\\". If you change any of it, execute your changes by typing in the console {bat \\\"ini\\\\kuerteeDisableLightsFarFromActors.ini\\\"} without the brackets. \r\n\r\n[*]Activate the mod. \r\n\r\n[/list] \r\n\r\n[center][size=7][color=#ff9900]Uninstall[/color][/size][/center] \r\n\r\n[list=1] \r\n\r\n[*]In the console, type \\\"SetPQV kuDLFFAQ uninstallNow True.\\\" Or with Sky UI\\'s MCM, set the uninstallNow toggle to True then exit the menus. \r\n\r\n[*]Wait for a message confirming the uninstallation. Save the game. \r\n\r\n[*]Deactivate the mod with Wrye Bash. If you installed this manually, simply delete all the files you installed. (Wrye Bash keeps track of files used, so installing/uninstalling the mod with it is 100% simpler.) \r\n\r\n[/list] \r\n\r\n[center][size=7][color=#ff9900]Troubleshooting[/color][/size][/center] \r\n\r\n[list] \r\n\r\n[*]You can reset the mod by typing {SetPQV kuDLFFAQ resetNow True} (without the brackets) in the console. Or with Sky UI\\'s MCM, set the resetNow toggle to True then exit the menus. \r\n\r\n[*]When it resets it will ask you either reset all of its data or continue with the current data. Resetting all its data will remove all your configurations and set the mod as if you have first installed it. \r\n\r\n[*]You can check all the mod\\'s data by typing {SQV kuDLFFAQ} in the console. You can check if your configurations were set in the mod properly with this. \r\n\r\n[*]If you find that your changes (with the command SetPQV or from executing the INI) does not appear in the mod, check the command again for spelling errors. Then try again. \r\n\r\n[*]If you find that resetting (with resetNow) and uninstalling (with uninstallNow) don\\'t seem to work, the mod may have been suspended. It is best to simply start-over (i.e. reinstall the mod) after a \\\"clean\\\" save. \r\n\r\n[*]Creating a clean save: \r\n\r\n[list=1] \r\n\r\n[*]If you can uninstall the mod from the console with {SetPQV kuDLFFAQ uninstallNow True}. \r\n\r\n[*]Wait for the mod to confirm the uninstallation. It may take a minute. If no confirmation appears, then simply continue to the next step. \r\n\r\n[*]Save the game manually from the console by typing {save uninstalledMod}. \r\n\r\n[*]Uninstall all the mod\\'s files (*.ESP, *.PSC, *.PEX) from the game folders. Make sure that none of the mod\\'s Scripts are left. A mod manager like Wrye is best used for this. \r\n\r\n[*]Load the \\\"uninstalledMod\\\" save. \r\n\r\n[*]Save the game manually again from the console by typing {save cleanSave}. Because all of the mod\\'s files were removed, all of its data will be \\\"zeroed\\\" in this game. \r\n\r\n[*]Play from this game. \r\n\r\n[/list] \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n[*]As a last resort, you can also enable script logging and investigate it and/or send it to me.
