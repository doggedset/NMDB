  "summary": "Adds two Guilds to complement each other for Argonian and Khajiit fighters",
  "descriptionHtml": "Based on Volek\\'s Riverwood Mercenary Guild: \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12400\r\n\r\nThis mod adds two seperate .esps that each add 7 completely unique companions that are all independant of Skyrim\\'s follower/hireling system. \r\nVolek made an ingenius system in his Riverwood Guild and they also allowed free use and adaption of this in any forms.\r\n\r\nThere are no changes to the scripts themselves so they completely compatable with the original and my Akaviri Guild.\r\n\r\nInfo on Mercs:\r\n\r\nThere are all Female except one Male Argonian storm mage. This reason is because there is no Khajiit nor Female companions that I have seen yet except David Brasher\\'s Followers Unlimited Mod... that is pure genius also. Simple and straight to the point with Voice dialogue to boot.\r\n\r\nYou can hire all mercs at the same time, they don\\'t add to the normal follower count.\r\nOnce hired, they will follow you and help in battle. You can give the following orders:\r\n\r\n•Wait at the current position\r\n•Wait at the targeted location \r\n•Follow (if waiting)\r\n•Attack an enemy target\r\n•Trade (optional sharing script available)\r\n•Set home base to current location (works for each merc individually)\r\n•Dismiss to the previously marked home\r\n•Push (useful in narrow spaces)\r\n\r\nThere are 14 completely unique companions in all, each with thier own classes and abilities..\r\nThere may be risidual notes and dialogue from the River Merc Guild but I will fix that if any.\r\n\r\nBoth Guilds can be accessed outside Riften in two entrances located directly East of the Riften Stables, if you go along the wall you will see two doors next to each other... this is a temporary location so dont worry.\r\n\r\nThanks again Volek.",
