  "descriptionHtml": "[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40615]Included in Relics of Hyrule[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[i]This mod is no longer supported because of its inclusion in Relics of Hyrule. \r<br />It is provided &#34;as-is,&#34; and Updates are very unlikely.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />&#34;WHAT&#33;?&#34; I hear you exclaim as you spit out your Nintendo Cereal System, &#34;You call that a Great Fairy&#39;s Sword&#33;? Where&#39;s the garish color scheme? The utterly unrealistic shape? Why doesn&#39;t it look like a 13 year old piece of plastic, and why is it modeled after the most beautiful sword in Skyrim? WHY.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />I know&#33; I&#39;m a terrible person for not accepting the original sword as perfect as the breath of Nayru herself, especially since Majora&#39;s Mask is my favorite Zelda game. \r<br />\r<br />First of all, there&#39;s already a very nice version of the classic Great Fairy&#39;s Sword out there:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13974[Right here, in fact. This is a link. But not Link.[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Second of all, this sword is my idea of what it would have looked like in Twilight Princess, or what it would look like in a realistic setting like Skyrim. \r<br />\r<br />A sword forged by a magical being would, in my mind, be crystalline and mysterious. I stayed very true to the original design, keeping the central rose and color scheme. the Glass Greatsword was perfect for the job because it already has a very nice flower motif as the Great Fairy&#39;s Sword did.\r<br />\r<br />Now, enough about the sword, let&#39;s talk about the sword.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The sword can be found in a building in Blackreach (for the sake of fun, I&#39;m not telling you where...yet) and is equal in power to an Elven Greatsword, but swings a little faster. It has a very strong enchantment which consists of...\r<br />\r<br />Poison Damage\r<br />Extra damage to undead with a chance of creating a turn undead explosion\r<br />High damage on critical hits\r<br />And a chance to heal the wielder by 100 points if the enemy is killed by a critical hit (I&#39;m not sure if this works or not)\r<br />\r<br />It can be tempered with an empty greater soul gem if you have the Arcane Blacksmith Perk.\r<br />\r<br />Since the Great Fairy&#39;s Sword is Termina&#39;s answer to the Biggoron&#39;s Sword, it only seems fitting that it would be very strong, and since Termina has no Master Sword to speak of, this reimagining of the Great Fairy&#39;s Sword has some elements of a blade that can vanquish evil.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-Video coming soon\r<br />-Tweaks to enchantment including daedra banishing may be forthcoming as well.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Majora&#39;s Mask:\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16235",
