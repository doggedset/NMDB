  "descriptionHtml": "Update 1.2:\r\n\r\n- Added dialogue to main NPCs.\r\n- Small advancement in mini-quest.\r\n\r\n\\'Thirty years have I spent my life here in Rudale, alongside my family and closest allies. My honoured friend, Farenor, and our beloved wives Serann and Alice came here, alongside her stands the adopted Breton sister of hers - Valyria.\\'\r\n\r\n- Tarafir\\'s Memoir\r\n\r\nRudale is a medium-sized campsite near Darkwater Crossing. It is inhabited by two Bosmer families, an Imperial consumed by greed, and a Nord hunter. In this small community, tensions are rising as the death of the village elder (Tarafir\\'s) Wife has recently died in a mysterious manner. \r\n\r\nThe player may find some background information regarding the founding of the growing encampment, as well as leading them to an unanticipated secret. There is also a small unoccupied shack for the player to use as their own if they so wish.\r\n\r\nNote: This is my first Skyrim mod. There isn\\'t much in the way of character interaction or gimicks. What this hopes to offer is a small piece of flavour to a small part of Skyrim, with it\\'s own story and possibly further expansion will be made in the future.\r\n\r\nUses Meo\\'s Tents, with many thanks to Meo: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12104\r\n\r\nCustom Installation: \r\nExtract the file\\'s contents to your Skyrim data directory, usually C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data.\r\n\r\nStart the game launcher and tick \\'Rudale.esp\\' under Data Files, and play.\r\n\r\nIncombatible with mods that may alter the area close to Darkwater Crossing.\r\n\r\n-Laurence27\r\n",
