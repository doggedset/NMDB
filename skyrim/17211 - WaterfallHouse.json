  "descriptionHtml": "Little house with plenty of harvestable tings, (lots of pot plants and other ingredients all about) and all the smithing, alchemy and enchanting stuff you might need to use. I labelled the chests so you don\\'t forget where you put tings and made them all locked to start with so you can improve your lockpicking skills. It has a veranda with a nice view and a waterfall. A comfy bed (with Well Rested perk) for after a hard day out and about questing and such, and a fireplace to put your feet up and eat your homegrown, homecooked foods. This is my first mod and I know the door is small, I am small to fit in the door. There is baby chickens and a baby cow too. Oh, and on the map it is just to the southwest of Morthal, near Talking Stone Camp.",
