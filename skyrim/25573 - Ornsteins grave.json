  "summary": "Ornstein never got buried, till now.",
  "descriptionHtml": "!Spoiler!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLore:\r\nAfter Ornstein got defeated by the choosen undead, Smough smashed him with his hammer. This hit was so hard that Ornsteins corpse fell into a dimensional rift, Lordrans boundaries are weak because the great flame will go out. Suddenly the corpse fell right into a battle near Solitude. The imperial soldier were confused who the stranger was. Elisif decided, she could decid if the stranger was for or against the imperials, that the stranger should be buried like a Nord.\r\n\r\nInformation:\r\n\r\nThis Mod remove some not important things in the hall of dead catacombs in Solidtude and adds a coffin with a potion in it. The potion heals you and makes you resistant against shock for 60sec but also weakens you against fire for 60sec. It isn´t much, because there is no Ornstein armor and spear, so pls don´t judge me. I´m just a fan of this guy and want that he get a real grave.\r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\nThe altar under the coffin is a bed. A little bit awkward but nothing bad.\r\n\r\nPermission:\r\n\r\nPls contact me if you want to use this or change something. I´m going to work more on this mod, but maybe there is someone who is better(this is not hard :D) / faster then me.",
