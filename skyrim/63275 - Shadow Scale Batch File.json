  "descriptionHtml": "Shadow Scales are Argonian assassins, trained mercilessly from the moment they hatch, bred to be the ultimate killer and servant of Sithis. so why, oh why are you so rubbish?&#33;, I mean did getting caught crossing the boarder really wipe away all of those years of hard wired training?\r<br />\r<br />anyway I got sick of it so I wrote a batch file, it will instantly make you a more believable assassin\r<br />\r<br />what does this do? it&#39;s a small file you place into your Skyrim folder(where the .EXE is)\r<br />when you enter the game and open the console, type in Bat ShadowScale\r<br />\r<br />it will instantly level Archery, Alchemy, Sneak, One Handed, Light Armor, Lockpicking and Pickpocket to 100 giving you around 30+ levels\r<br />if you don&#39;t want to level just change &#34;AdvSkill to SetSkill&#34;\r<br />it also adds a handful of helpful spells like Frenzy, and Rout\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ll also include an optional bat for Shadow Scales who think they should be able to shout straight up, it&#39;s only 3 shouts, Become Ethereal, Whirlwind Sprint and Throw Voice\r<br />\r<br />now while most would argue that Picking Pockets is useless for an assassin because you can loot your victims when they are dead, I somewhat agree but there are a plethora of poisons out there that you can place onto your targetsÂ ",
