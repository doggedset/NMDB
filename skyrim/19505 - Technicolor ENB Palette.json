  "descriptionHtml": "Use this as your ENB Colour Palette and boost saturation quite a lot in the enbeffect.fx config file to make Skyrim look like a technicolor movie from the 1930s-1960s!\r\n\r\nLooks pretty awesome if you use a subtle blur/sharp-shift effect and some noise (film grain!) in the effect.txt file.\r\n\r\nThe palette is in it\\'s raw 1024x1024 form, but is perfectly usable at this size, with no measurable drop in performance at all (for me at least). This size also means my super-subtle dithering/colour distortion effect works.\r\n\r\nI was originally developing this for my own ENB config, but alas there are many far better ENB devs than myself out there so I abandoned the project :)",
