Eden take up 6 exterior cells and will conflict with anything that changes any of those cells. \r<br />As far as i know there are no mods that change these cells but............\r<br />\r<br />Arena fight start and reset is a little buggy but it works, i cant get it working any better\r<br />========\r<br />\r<br />Details\r<br />=======\r<br />Lower entrance is near Reach Stormcloak Camp\r<br />Upper Entrance is near Hunters Retreat\r<br />Both map markers are enabled\r<br />It&#39;s free, all you need to do is enter the front door\r<br />\r<br />Credits\r<br />...Solo for the original concept of Solace (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20265) although this started of changing Solace to suit me \r<br />... its gone far away from that now but the original base cavern concept and idea in entrance hall should be credited to solo\r<br />\r<br />...Many of the dungeon ideas also come from a mod called EVIL LAIR OF HYDRA by hydralisk77 (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12556)\r<br />\r<br />1, shedidwhat for converting Growlfs slave chains\r<br />2, Blary for his resources\r<br />3, Insanity for his resources available here.........http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php\r<br />4, Runrespect for his resources\r<br />5, Growlf for the slave armor\r<br />6, Petrovich for the UNP Leather Clothes\r<br />7, TESA for more resources all available here.........http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php\r<br />8, Breti for more resources\r<br />9, Neo for his Tina boots\r<br />10, Little Baron for art frame mesh\r<br />11, MJY for more resources\r<br />12  Tamira/Stroti for more geat resources\r<br />12, If ive left you out please let me know\r<br />\r<br />My beta testers\r<br />\r<br />Gentester For testing and friendship check out her great work here......http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/647612\r<br />LordRahl  for testing\r<br />Aquariumreef for testing\r<br />shedidwhat for testing\r<br />darkshot64 for testing\r<br />\r<br />Install\r<br />=======\r<br />1.
