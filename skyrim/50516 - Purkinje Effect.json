  "summary": "A shader program to simulate human eye perception under dim light condition.",
  "descriptionHtml": "When luminance falls below a threshold, rod cells&#39; stimuli takes over cone cells&#39;. Rod cells&#39; almost absent sensitivity to red light, and high sensitivity to blue-green light results in the blue images we see at night.\r<br />\r<br />This shader program attempts to correct colour by simulating the above effect. As you can see in the screenshot, dim environment desaturates and &#34;glows&#34; blue while the light cast by blacksmith fire maintains red because light from there is still strong enough for the red cone cells.\r<br />\r<br />Requires ENB\r<br />\r<br />A compiled fx and the source are uploaded. You can add the source to your own enb effect file and change some of the parameters yourselves.\r<br />\r<br />Note: it also makes the night eye spell effect work again and a little differently.\r<br />you may need to tweak the if statement a little bit since i&#39;m not sure how that parameter translates to the spell effect strength and the spell effect strength may be altered by mods.",
