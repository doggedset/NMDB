  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a book to the game called, \\\"Bard\\'s Leap - A Tale.\\\"\r\n\r\nThe book can be found and bought in the Riverwood Trader and at Belethor\\'s General Goods, as well as randomly as a leveled item. It can also be found at Bards Leap, in the Forsworn tent across from the pool of water. When you read it, it adds the Bards Leap Summit location to your map.\r\n\r\nThis book is an example work for the Skyrim Publishing Inc. mod, which is a WIP. Skyrim Publishing Inc. is a project that will be running a real fanfiction publication inside the world of Skyrim. Short stories from fans will be added to the world in each update, and can be found in the world to read at your perusal.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about the Skyrim Publishing Inc., visit the thread on the Nexus and Skyrim forums:\r\n\r\n\r\nNexus Forums:\r\nhttp://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/570668-wip-skyrim-publishing-inc/\r\n\r\nSkyrim Forums:\r\nhttp://skyrimforums.org/threads/wip-skyrim-publishing-inc.705",
