See pics for location and what to look for. I advise you check the knapsack first. Read the note, then the journal. After that, check the chest.\r\n\r\n[i]How ?[/i]\r\nMagicka.\r\n\r\n[i]Why ?[/i]\r\nUm...\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Misfit Mage:[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n_Bands Dark\r\n_Bands Light\r\n_Trousers Dark\r\n_Trousers Light\r\n_Leggings/Panties Dark\r\n_Leggings/Panties Light\r\n_Pouch\r\n_Pouch Dark\r\n_Pouch Light\r\n_Bodice\r\n_Skirt\r\n_Rope\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Misfit Mage - School Spirit:[/b][/size]\r\n_Bodice Alteration\r\n_Bodice Conjuration\r\n_Bodice Destruction\r\n_Bodice Illusion\r\n_Bodice Restoration\r\n\r\n_Bracers Alteration\r\n_Bracers Conjuration\r\n_Bracers Destruction\r\n_Bracers Illusion\r\n_Bracers Restoration\r\n\r\n_Skirt Alteration\r\n_Skirt Conjuration\r\n_Skirt Destruction\r\n_Skirt Illusion\r\n_Skirt Restoration\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Patches:[/b][/size]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36873/]German Translation[/url] - by Lorina\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37369]UNPB BBP[/url] - by Mr Troublemaker\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Usage:[/b][/size]\r\n_Equip the items. Some of them, all of them. Choice is yours. The clothing is \\'modular\\', meaning you can pick n\\' choose what to wear.\r\n\r\n_There is no footwear for this mod. Couldn\\'t settle for anything. However, the trousers have been partitioned just like the original mage pants (cutting off at the knee). Feel free to mess around with matching up some footwear. I like the foot wraps, but that\\'s me and my hardy adventurer character romping around in the warm weather - thanks to acidzebra\\'s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27636/]Springtime Overhaul mod[/url] ;)\r\n\r\n_The trousers or leggings+panties can be equipped. No, you can\\'t separately equip the panties from the stockings. This was intentional. If you know a bit about Nifskope and the Creation Kit, you certainly can break these up even further.\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Notes:[/b][/size]\r\nThe UNP form included with this mod (when equipping the bodice models) is a custom hack job by me. Its loosely based off Kurese\\' \\\"Astaroth\\\" variation. I wanted to see a bust, some cleavage. Not for perversion\\'s sake, but for a more \\'supportive\\' look to the bodice. Mod authors: If you\\'d like to use my UNP form edits to craft other clothes/armor meshes... feel free ! Just notify me before uploading. I will try my best to check my PM box once a week. So give it a few days if you don\\'t hear from me right away.\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Permissions:[/b][/size]\r\nDo what you want with the esp file. Just be sure it STAYS ON THE NEXUS. No other sites, please and thank you. And the textures/meshes are locked into this mod. UNPB and BBP conversions are fine, just notify me BEFORE you upload. Same goes for esp alterations. And make a link back to this page, thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Credits/Thanks:[/b][/size]\r\n_Mr TroubleMaker and Dikr - for the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21271]Bouncy Bodice[/url] mod. I used portions of the textures as a basis for this mod.\r\n_SydneyB and Dimon - for the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18008]Ashara Princess[/url] stockings. I used portions of Sydney\\'s textures and also Dimon\\'s original meshes for this mod.\r\n_Anano - for, yet again, the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14294]Osare[/url] panty mesh. I used my variation from Khantu\\'s Armor set as a basis for this version.\r\n_AsianBoy345 - for the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25846]Tera Armor UNP Collection[/url]. I used the meshes/textures of one of the sets for the basis of the Misfit Mage bracers.\r\n_[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709]Dimon[/url] - UNP body form. He started the Rebellion. I\\'m glad to have helped bring this more natural female body form to its high status.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Special Thanks:[/b][/size]\r\nMiss Lexi, the most patient online buddy I\\'ve ever had the pleasure of communicating with. This mod would not be live if it weren\\'t for her. Do me a favor: if you enjoyed any part of this mod - stop by her [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/1307000]profile page[/url] and give a kudos point.
