  "descriptionHtml": "HELLSPIRE\r<br />=============================================================================================\r<br />THIS MOD IS NOW ABANDONED AS IT WAS A PROJECT TO SEE THE EXTENT OF WHAT I COULD DO WITH THE CK. NOW I HAVE A LOT MORE MODDING EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE I AM CURRENTLY WORKING ON A NEW WORLDSPACE MOD FROM SCRATCH WHICH WILL BE MUCH BETTER THAN HELLSPIRE. IT WILL BE A NEW REALM OF OBLIVION: THE PIT OF SORROW.\r<br />=============================================================================================\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: YOU WILL HAVE TO START HELLSPIRE MOD FROM THE BEGINNING WITH NO SAVE DATA FOR THIS MOD TO ACCESS THE NEW AREAS AND FINISH THE MOD COMPLETELY TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE MOVIE CUTSCENES.\r<br />\r<br />This is my totally unique worldspace/quest mod I have been working on for some time now. It tells the story of a Fallen god who once served the Aedra as an angel of death but then grew to be evil and was cast down to the Infernal realm of Hellspire. \r<br />\r<br />Explore the infernal realm of Hellspire, a hellish place that exists between the worlds. All manner of terrifying and demonic creatures inhabit the tormented landscape, but all bow to Azazel the fallen god. Do you have what it takes to beat Hellspire? Be warned all the creatures and bosses in Hellspire are tough. This won&#39;t be a walk in the park like defeating Alduin or Miraak.
