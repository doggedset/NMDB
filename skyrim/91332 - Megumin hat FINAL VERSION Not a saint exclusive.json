  "descriptionHtml": "EXPLOSION!\n<br />\n<br />there may be some very minor clipping in the back, near the horn of the hat. If you have dark hair this is hardly noticeable.\n<br />I will also say that the screenshots do not appear to show the \"mouth\" going all the way around the hat. I promise that it now does!Â \n<br />\n<br />I highly suggest you go on steam and find the Megumin explosion magic mod, which comes with voice files. It is superior to using Midas Magic nuke power.\n<br />\n<br />you will need this mod. All credit to mod author YSBKVKUD\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11049\n<br />\n<br />Then replace the textures with my files.\n<br />\n<br />My original attempt on this idea was a failure, but a learning experience. do not look for the old mod, Megumin blew it to dust.\n<br />\n<br />I would like someone to suggest an eyepatch mod I might recolor",
