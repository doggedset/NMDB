When you enter the main room there you will find the Alchemy lab with several shelves of ingredients as well as potients.  The master bedroom is large with a sleepable bed for two.[/size][size=3]Under the stairs are two weapon racks and a safe. Upstairs after you pass the upper dining table for two you&#39;ll find two beds for Companions.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=3]The Forge and crafting area in the out building are fully functional and the rock deck with table and chairs has usable plants growing around it. The salmon on the fish rack by the pier can be harvested.[/size][size=3]On occasion a dragon will come around so it makes things interesting, after you kill the dragon if you want to get rid of the bones just open the console, highlight the dragon and use the disable command, they will go away.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=3]This mod is my first player home and is still in a beta state. I intend to make the potion and ingredient shelves storage capable and I would like to add fish in the water down by the pier for player usage. I&#39;m also thinking of making the boat at the end of the pier a way point for travel but that&#39;s in the far future.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=3]I hope you enjoy HRC and if you encounter any issues or have suggestions please let me know.[/size][/size][size=5]\r<br />\r<br />*************************************\r<br />Alternate version V1.2 with custom music.\r<br />[size=3]All songs are free to use for non commercial purposes by the CC License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/\r<br />[size=4]\r<br />Music Credits[/size]:\r<br />1. &#34;Celtic&#34; - Celestial Aeon Project\r<br />2. &#34;Dragons (celtic version 2013)&#34; - Roger Subirana Mata\r<br />3. &#34;King of the Fairies/Mermaid&#34; - Brigan\r<br />4. &#34;MRT-13&#34; - Elke Das\r<br />5. &#34;High Ridge Cottage Battle&#34; - Elephant Angel\r<br />6. &#34;Blind Mary&#34; - Siog\r<br />7. &#34;Eyes in the Stars&#34; - Butterfly Tea\r<br />\r<br />All artists can be found at http://jamendo.com except Elephant Angel, http://elephantangel.johngarza.com\r<br />\r<br />[/size][b]\r<br />*********************************\r<br />Known Issues I&#39;m working on:\r<br />[/b][/size][size=4][size=3]There is an issue with the navmesh at the front door that I can&#39;t seem to figure out, Followers can enter the door but cannot exit so when you leave they will appear across the lake and swim across to the house, still working on that.\r<br />\r<br />Update: thanks to Zimmermjaz problem solved, after more tests a new version file will be uploaded\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.1 uploaded with Navmesh fix, please report any issues with this file if you find any, Thanks[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]******************************\r<br />HRC should not require any other mods to work and does not effect the area other than a bit of grass trimimg and lowering of the land I had to do to make the front of the house and the stairs to the forge area work[/size][/size][size=3]\r<br />\r<br />*************************************************\r<br />\r<br />This is a work in progress and by suggestion I will be adding containers in the crafting area for supplies and in the pier area for fish. Something else I&#39;ll be doing is adding original music in the house.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Dragonstar99 for testing the beta and  Mrpdean, Tamnb0 and Jet4571 with help on the terrain around the house.[/size]",
