  "descriptionHtml": "[b]What:[/b] This is a very simple mod that opens the allure perk to apply to both sexes. Nothing more. This doesn\\'t affect the shape of the skill tree, so it should have no compatibility issues with mods that do. To ensure this mod does it\\'s job, you may want to load it [i]after[/i] any more complex perk changing mods.\r\n\r\n[b]Why:[/b] There should, at minimum, be a choice over which sex you want to affect. (Kind of like you can choose which sex to marry. Crazy, right?) I originally considered splitting the skill tree to allow that, but for such a simple change, I didn\\'t think it was worth the potential issues with the more involved perk tree mods, so you get an all-in-one solution.",
