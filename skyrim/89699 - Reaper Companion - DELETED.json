  "descriptionHtml": "[center]ï»¿[size=5]Yep you read the title right. I wanted something different and I done did it. I pulled her from (I made it female) Soul Cairn and dropped her at the entrance of Riverwood. She's been enhanced like most my other followers and I thought it best to let ya try her out and see. So far bugs I noticed was she doesn't melee and rarely uses her bow. I spent hours doing what I could even disabling most my mods to no avail. Mainly she spits out green slime which is quite effective at least. I'll add more in a while when I take a break until then enjoy and remember this will break Reaper from being in Soul Cairn and of course requires Dawngaurd.\n<br />\n<br />Note: This will continued to be worked on when time permits.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/center]",
