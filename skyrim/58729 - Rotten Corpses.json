  "descriptionHtml": "First of all i must credit[u] [/u][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2331459][u]futoshisa[/u]n[/url] as he let me use his awesome resources from where most of this mod has been made.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]DESCRIPTION[/b][/u]\r<br />This mod makes all (more than 100) dead characters look...well, dead., with more than 60 new body meshes and textures ., no more intact bodies that supposedly died time ago. (if i forgot some npc or some npc shouldn&#39;t be included let me know).\r<br />\r<br />The .esp just modifies dead characters and makes a new bald hair so it should be compatible with nearly everything but mods that modify those dead characters which is unlikely, load order should not matter for that reason.(Reported crash after execution scene, activate mod after at least entrance in the building)\r<br />\r<br />Only vanilla bodies are modified with the mod, dead skeletons are untouched also.\r<br />\r<br />Requires dawnguard and dragonborn, don&#39;t expect a vanilla only version,sorry.\r<br />\r<br />Contains partial nudity in some bodies.\r<br />\r<br />I didn&#39;t have much time to test it so it might have a bug or two, nothing that will break the savegame though, if you resurrect a &#39;&#39;zombie&#39;&#39; via console command for the lulz, it is recommended to not save the game, but i might not really be a problem. \r<br />\r<br />[u]Possible bugs in some bodies:\r<br />[/u]-[s]Corpses might have hair, i made a bold hair for them but they might still end up using the original hair sometimes.[/s]\r<br />[s]-Weird looking foot in some female models.[/s]\r<br />[s]-When resurrected some zombies right foot (or was it left?) starts wiggling around.[/s]\r<br />-Reported crash on helgen, activate mod after cave exit, will try to fix soon. (Edit: Hopefully it got fixed with v2.0, it&#39;s recommended to activate all mods after helgen anyway )\r<br />\r<br />Changelog: \r<br />V1:\r<br /> Release\r<br />\r<br />v2:\r<br />New skeleton for affected npc&#39;s, fixing left foot bug.\r<br />Added new models and more dead npc&#39;s changed.\r<br />Fixed some minor bugs.\r<br />\r<br />v3:\r<br />Fixed male elven clothes textures\r<br />a few tweaks on race settings\r<br />\r<br />Check my other mods¡",
