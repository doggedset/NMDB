  "descriptionHtml": "Improved Description:\r<br />\r<br />Ever wondered why are vampire strong when they are starving and weak when they are fed ?\r<br />Then this mod is done for you.\r<br />I basically did this mod because I could find plenty of vampire inverter/reverters, and none for the vampire lord, and I thnk it must follow the same mechanics.\r<br />\r<br />BE CAREFUL AND LOAD THIS MOD BEFORE ANY OTHER VAMPRE LORD MODIFICATION LIKE ROYAL BLOODLINE (by Xyks) OR ULTRA VAMPIRISM OVERHAUL (by Velgdran) OR TRUE VAMPIRE LORD (by Sann) THEN THIS MOD WILL ONLY CHANGE WHAT THEY DON&#39;T &#33;\r<br />\r<br />What this mod changes:\r<br />\r<br />... adjust the sunlight weakness to be smoother early levels of vampirism and harder at lasts.\r<br />... change the Blood spell (right hand) to be more efficient when you are fed and less when you are starving.\r<br />... Adjust the reanimate spell; (after all you are a vampire lord) up to 50 when you are fed and down to 10 when you are starving.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I must give credits to Velgdran and all of the modder who did a vampire inverter and inspired me for this \r<br />\r<br />(I DID NOT use any of their work, they only gave me ideas, and if I did, then it&#39;s an accident, I&#39;m new with the CK, just let me know, I&#39;ll fix it)\r<br />\r<br />This is my 1st uploaded mod and IT COULD HAVE some problems ( even if I wonder how) and some things I didn&#39;t think about.\r<br />\r<br />Thank for reading\r<br />\r<br />Thanks ( A LOT ) Lupus590 for the improved description.\r<br />",
