  "descriptionHtml": "3DS max Skeleton - CAT system with Z axis orientation\r\nReady for export into nifscope. With correct names for charater parts of a body. Names of wepons and armor and magic begins with NPC, but thay have no sence for the body.\r\nIt has no tail, may be i will create it in future.\r\n\r\nSee more at\r\nhttp://3694.blogspot.com/search/label/Skyrim\r\nThere you wil find a whole process for creation of new character for Skyrim from importing into 3DS MAX and exporting it into the Game.\r\n\r\nFile correctly works in Max 2011 and Max 2012. For Max 2010 you need to dowload a autodesk_3ds_max_cat_2010_32bit or autodesk_3ds_max_cat_2010_62bit - depends on system you use.\r\n\r\nRig works. Tested in nifscope. I created a whole new body (not my mesh), whole new unwarp, new normal maps for head and body. Using nifscope edited and imported into the Skyrim. All works fine. Skin was firstly taken through the Skinwrap from original model, converted and corrected in max. \r\nYou can see more at my blog - link above.",
