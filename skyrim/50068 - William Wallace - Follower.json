  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds the legendary, English killing, kilt wearing S.O.B named William Wallace. I tired to base him as beastly as i could off of his Braveheart appearance, he comes with a re textured version of Scaled Armor. He is non essential so he can be kill (in other words do send him to kill 2 giants alone... it wont end well). He can be found in the Palace of Kings in Windhelm, he is only level 10 (may change so he levels with player), He is UFO Compatible. I am thinking about making him shoot fireballs from his arse and being able to shout FREEDOM&#33;\r<br />\r<br />",
