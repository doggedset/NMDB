  "descriptionHtml": "[color=purple][size=32]Soul Food[/size][/color]\r\nA Mod by: Rifli\r\n\r\n[u]Description[/u]\r\n\r\n[color=#DB7900]\\\"Cheese, for everyone!\\\"\r\n-Sheogorath, on his Soul Food.[/color]\r\n\r\nThis mod adds 6 new types of Soul Food to Skyrim. Each one is placed in leveled list, so they can be found were you would expect to find any other soul gem. They are sold by vendors, found in loot, and anywhere else a soul gem would be found (except the magic soul gem traps). Each food is equivalent to a standard soul gem (i.e. soul tomato=grand soul gem), and no two Soul Foods are the same food type. They work just like standard soul gems. I\\'ve also included a replacer version to replace the normal soul gems, in case you are worried about minor leveled list conflicts. There is also an optional file that adds a single soul tomato, near where Sheogorath\\'s quest is located. This version doesn\\'t add any of the other Soul Foods, and the leveled lists are not touched. Just a little bit of nostalgia for the Shivering Isles.\r\n \r\nSoul Cabbage=Black Soul Gem\r\nSoul Tomato=Grand Soul Gem\r\nSoul Potato=Greater Soul Gem\r\nSoul Cheese=Common Soul Gem\r\nSoul Apple=Lesser Soul Gem\r\nSoul Bread=Petty Soul Gem\r\n\r\nNote: All files can be used at the same time, though there is not really a point in using both the replacer and leveled list version at the same time, as all the gems and Soul Food will look the same.\r\n\r\nConstructive feedback, complements, and suggestions are all appreciated. \r\n\r\n[u]Current Features[/u]\r\n\r\n-Brand new fully functioning Soul Food.\r\n-Soul Food added to leveled lists.\r\n-Replacer version, to replace standard soul gems.\r\n-A different food for each gem type.\r\n\r\n[u]Bugs[/u]\r\n\r\nNone known so far in the newest version.\r\n\r\nPlease report any and all bugs to me over comments or PM\\'s.\r\n\r\n[u]Installation[/u]\r\n\r\nSimply download the file and extract the ESP into the \\\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\" (without quotes) or your corresponding folder.\r\n\r\n[u]Uninstallation[/u]\r\n\r\nSimply delete the ESP  from your \\\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\" (without quotes) or your corresponding folder.\r\n\r\n[u]Incompatibilities[/u]\r\n\r\n-Any mod that changes the model of soul gems, in the case of the replacer version.\r\n-Small conflict possibility with other mods that change leveled lists. (I personally use many mods with leveled list changes, and nothing bad has happened. You\\'re just less likely to see any individual item, as there are more.)\r\n\r\n[u]Credits[/u]\r\n\r\nBethesda- For the Creation Kit, Skyrim, and the basic idea.
