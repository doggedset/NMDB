  "summary": "Alternate dark grey color for Elven items",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple re-texture of Elven items with only the color being changed. I felt that the default golden/brass color just looked to \\\"ornamental\\\", so I edited the colors to look a bit more like ebony armor. I also enhanced the red accents for some better contrast. All Elven weapons and armor (male and female) are covered.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION: just extract the archive and move the \\\"textures\\\" directory of your Data folder.\r\n\r\nNote: this will override the default textures, and as such, may conflict with any other mod that does the same.",
