  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds an auto-sort script to the existing &#34;starter&#34; chests for the three Hearthfire homes, making it quick and easy to store your building supplies.  \r<br />\r<br />You can also choose to have the three chests share the same inventory so that what you store in one chest will be available in another.  Both the auto-sorting and the shared inventory are optional features that can be turned on or off at any time.   \r<br />\r<br />[size=2]Also check out [/size][size=3][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18021]Blacksmith Storage Chests[/url][/size][size=2] for even more convenient storage options.\r<br />A combined version of these two mods is now available.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]REQUIREMENTS AND COMPATIBILITY[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Requires Hearthfire.  This mod will conflict with other mods that alter the BYOHHouseCraftingChest.  Otherwise, it should be completely compatible with any other mod.\r<br />\r<br />There is now a combined version of Blacksmith Storage Chests and Carpenter Chests.  It can be found [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18021]here[/url]. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]OPTIONAL SETTINGS[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />To access the Settings menu, activate the chest while sneaking.\r<br />\r<br />Each chest is individually configurable with the following settings:\r<br />- Auto-sorting menu for building supplies (default = On)\r<br />- Shared Inventory (default = Off)\r<br />\r<br />These features work independently of one another, so you can have auto-sorting along with shared inventory, or shared inventory without auto-sorting, etc.  Each chest is set independently of the others.  This means that you can choose to share the inventory between all or just some of the chests or set them so that the auto-sorting menu appears for one chest but not another.  If you want to connect a new chest to the shared inventory, you simply change the setting for that chest, close and reopen the chest.  If you have things already stored in the chest before connecting it, those items will simply get added to the shared inventory.  You can change the settings at any time, as often as you want, and you will never lose any items.  If items disappear from one chest after toggling the shared inventory, simply turn the shared inventory back on to regain access to the items and remove them from the shared inventory.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]NOTES[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />While the auto-sorting menu is designed for construction supplies, you can obviously choose to store anything you want in the chests.  \r<br />\r<br />When a chest is connected to the shared inventory, it will say &#34;Empty&#34; when you hover over it with the cursor.  This is simply an artifact of the way in which the shared inventory works.  Your supplies are still safe and will immediately appear as soon as you open the chest. \r<br />\r<br />If you have auto-sorting turned on, but have no building supplies in your inventory, then the auto-sort menu will not appear.\r<br />\r<br />You cannot access the shared inventory while sneaking.  If you add things to the chest while sneaking (and with shared inventory turned on), the items will be added to the shared inventory once you close the chest.  To access the items, open the chest when not sneaking.\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />[center][size=5][b]CREDITS[/b][/size]\r<br />[size=3]Thank you to [color=orange][b]Manilla Turtle[/b][/color] for his [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12468]Automatic Item Storage[/url]  script, which was used as the model for my script.[/size][/center]\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[center][b][size=3][color=#c1b868]ALSO CHECK OUT MY OTHER MODS...[/color][/size][/b][/center][b]\r<br />[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34612/?][img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5IhXKEObr7k/Ud4Jp5gJ2OI/AAAAAAAAA4U/xKD5j5HjVIM/s450/Trading%2520Variables%2520TitleSM.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34093][img]https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QzSe3C9zMuo/UWYcQCqORoI/AAAAAAAAA1Y/0jJd9xUNSHE/s390/WAFRsm.png[/img][/url]     [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28418][img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JCD3XInyVB0/UWYcMNqIMGI/AAAAAAAAA1Q/5Wy1501gK5A/s390/SSR_TitleThumbnail.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />[/b][center][b][size=5][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26359]The Choice is Yours - Fewer Forced Quests[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38151/]Timing is Everything[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14157]Thieves Guild Requirements[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31799]Traps Make Noise[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16531]Better Stealth AI for Followers[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18021]Blacksmith Storage Chests[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26727]Carpenter Chests for Hearthfire[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18024]Smelters for Riften and Solitude[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16090]Upgrade Leveled Items Spell[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13057]Thieves Guild Followers[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13632]Nightingale Hall & Karliah as Follower[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13059]Brynjolf & Vex As Followers[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23431]Sell Stones of Barenziah[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16134]Shadowmarks for Player Homes[/url]\r<br />[/size][/b][/center]",
