It holds the crafting menu clean by not show the recipes that you do not have the materials to make. Except for the Basic Recipe,(1 ingot recipe) that one is always visible, so if you go to a smelter with enough ore to make 5 ingots, that recipe will be visible to use, when used the recipe disappear again to next time you have enough ores, It is Clean and handy :)",
