  "descriptionHtml": "Description:\r\nHave you ever wanted a pale snow white vampire in Skyrim but couldn\\'t find a mod that does what you\\'re looking for? Well, this does it! Not only that but it changes the texture for Vampires to a CBBE version that has an \\\"innie\\\" rather than \\\"outie\\\" pussy (vulva, labia, snatch, cooch, twat, whatever the hell you want to call it!). Comes in two styles (currently): Shaved/waxed (default), and Traditional. See images/installer for exact depictions. Includes optional red glowing eye mesh by RaisTheWolf and textures modified from those and nevenbridge\\'s natural eyes. Also includes very poorly put together male vampire textures for SOS & Better Males.\r\n\r\nDo you want \\\"innies\\\" for normal CBBE characters as well? Then grab my [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/39301]CBBE Innies[/url] mod.\r\n\r\nNote: I won\\'t provide support for the supplied male textures, they\\'re only provided as a courtesy so you can at least have male vampire textures compatible with the most popular male body mods if you install VTF. I only spent a few seconds and you\\'d be better off with someone doing a real male vampire texture pack! These are completely optional and I don\\'t really recommend them. You\\'d be better off copying over your files from SOS to the VTF folder and renaming appropriately most likely. If you have Better Males instead of SOS the textures may be acceptable.\r\n\r\nNote: Keep in mind these screenshots were taken indoors. If you get good lighting outdoors or use an ENB you\\'ll probably be blindingly white. I tried to find a good balance of white without trying to lose detail and blind people.\r\n\r\n[color=red]THIS MOD REQUIRES VAMPIRE TEXTURE FRAMEWORK OR IT WILL DO LITERALLY NOTHING![/color]\r\n\r\nVTF moves vampire textures from being dependant on your character\\'s body textures and moves them to textures/VTF so you can have unique textures for vampires which allows for pale vampires. Without VTF you can only edit the vampire face texture which will not be able to produce a pale vampire result, so you need it for this mod to work. Grab and install that FIRST.\r\n\r\nChanges include:\r\n-\\\"innie\\\" pussy/reworked vulva\r\n-edit of lower back, vulva, stomach, and nipples on normal map\r\n-new spec map\r\n-completely new pale white vampire texture for both male and female\r\n-optional glowing vampire eye meshes by RaisTheWolf and optional red on white vampire eyes as seen in screenshots\r\n\r\nShould be compatible with adding shaving styles via [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5737]TextureBlend[/url] if you would like more options than provided. Just install shaved/waxed style if you intend to add different styles with texture blend!\r\n\r\n[size=5]REQUIREMENTS[/size]\r\n[color=red](required)[/color] [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666]Calientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition -CBBE- by Caliente[/url]\r\n[color=red](required)[/color] [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31136]VTF - Vampire Texture Framework by SableDrake[/url]\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n-Install CBBE if you haven\\'t yet - these textures are not compatible with non-CBBE compatible bodies.\r\n-Install VTF - Vampire Texture Framework [color=red](critical step!)[/color].\r\n-Install with NMM.
