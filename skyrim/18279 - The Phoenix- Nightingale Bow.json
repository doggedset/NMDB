  "summary": "Yes we have seen unbound bows here, but this one is less of an eyesore and can fire unlimited arrows of any kind (Daedric, Ebony, whatever your heart desires).",
  "descriptionHtml": "Okay, so you just love the Archery skill but want your bow to fire unlimited arrows AND not make you look like a freak with a ghosty bow on your back. Well, this is what you need...\r\n\r\nIt fires the arrows of your choosing and only has the slight glow of embers (hence \\\"Phoenix) when equipped, but when it\\'s sheathed on your back it looks like a regular Nightingale bow... so now you can view yourself without an eyesore.\r\n\r\nIn order to find it (I don\\'t know how to place it anywhere yet), type \\\"help unbound 4\\\" in the console and find the Unbound Nightingale Bow and type this in the console: player.additem <itemcode> 1\r\n\r\nYou can also do the same with the arrows of your choosing.\r\n\r\nAlso, this is my first serious time messing around with the Creation Kit and if anyone has some suggestions or could help me, please don\\'t be afraid to say so!",
