Also added to common loot.\r\n\r\n===============\r\n= Description =\r\n===============\r\n-Was disappointed to not really see crossbows outside the expansion NPCs. So added it to some generic loot for bows across all levels.\r\n-Adds Crossbows and Dwarven ( Including Enchanted ) variants to most common loots for Bows and more types of bolts.\r\n+There are 2 additional variations to each crossbow.\r\n++Rusted Steel Crossbow - Slightly slower and less damage then normal.\r\n++Tuned Steel Crossbow - Shoots 10% quicker then normal and has about the same damage as normal.\r\n++Ancient Dwarven Crossbow - Slightly slower and less damage then normal.\r\n++Tuned Dwarven Crossbow - Shoots 10% quicker then normal and has about the same damage as normal.\r\n\r\n+Also adds some variations of the bolts\r\n++Dragonbone Bolt: Strongest bolt, requires a Dragonbone and Firewood per 12.\r\n++Ebony Bolt: Strong bolt, requires a Ebony Ingot and Firewood per 12.\r\n++Elven Bolt: Decent bolt, requires a Refined Moonstone Ingot, Quicksilver Ingot and 2 Firewood per 24.\r\n++Glass Bolt: Decent bolt, requires a Malachite Ingot and Firewood per 12.\r\n++Orcish Bolt: Decent bolt, requires a Orichalum Ingot and Firewood per 12.\r\n++Rusted Steel Bolt: Deals slightly less damage then normal.\r\n++Ancient Dwarven Bolt: Same as Rusted Steel Bolt ( On par with normal Steel Bolt. )\r\n\r\nThere is also Exploding <Type> of <Element> of the following:\r\nDragonbone, Ebony, Glass, Elven, and Orcish. They are crafted only. ( Also requires Arcane Blacksmith + Smithing perk for correct type. )\r\n++Requires 1 Fire, Frost or Void Salt and 10 Bolts.\r\n\r\n+Renamed normal variation of Crossbow to Steel Crossbow ( and all Enchanted crossbows to Steel Crossbow of <Enchant> )\r\n\r\nNPCs that may have it for sale or Containers:\r\n-Any that rely on LItemWeaponBow and LItemWeaponBowFine.\r\n\r\nNPCs that can have it:\r\n-Imperial and Stormcloak soldiers.\r\n-Bandits and any that use LItemBanditWeaponBow.\r\n\r\n=========\r\n= Notes =\r\n=========\r\nMay require a full wait period of 3~7 days for loot to 'reset' to take effect.\r\nMay conflict with other mods that edit LItemBanditWeaponBow, LItemWeaponBow, LItemWeaponBowFine, CWSoldierImperialGear, CWSoldierImperialGearNoTorch, CWSoldierSonsGear, CWSoldierSonsGearNoTorch.\r\n\r\n============\r\n= Updating =\r\n============\r\nDue to change of name, you have to uninstall the previous version before enabling this one. Wait 3~7 days ( Again! ) to make sure all NPCs and loot have the new setup.\r\n\r\n=================\r\n=Version History=\r\n=================\r\n== Version 1.3 ==\r\n-Added 5 new bolts. All can be crafted with appropriate perks. They also can be found as loot or from vendors. They do about same damage as arrow versions.\r\n-Added 15 enchanted bolts. 3 for each new bolt ( Craftable ).\r\n-Renamed to Crossbow Expansion as it does more then add more crossbow locations. ( You may lose any custom crossbow / bolts added by the older version to this version. )\r\n\r\n== Version 1.2 ==\r\n-Added new textures and models for Rusted Steel Crossbow + Bolts and Ancient Dwarven Crossbow + Bolt.\r\n-Lowered damage of Rusted Steel Crossbow by about 2 damage. ( Before perks and skill levels. )\r\n\r\n== Version 1.1 ==\r\n-Added Crossbows to Imperial and Stormcloaks. ( They will randomize between either their normal bow or a Steel Crossbow + Random Bolts. )\r\n\r\n== Version 1.0 ==\r\nInitial Release",
