  "descriptionHtml": "This mod changes player dialogue when guards try to arrest you and when making requests for bards\r<br />to more friendly and respectful ones.   Like adding please to what your character says. Some dialogue weren&#39;t changed since some are already friendly\r<br />\r<br />I also have an alternative to this mod which adds mean player dialogue-http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53371/?\r<br />\r<br />Known Bugs\r<br />\r<br />1.This mod WILL conflict with my mean dialogue mod or other mods that change dialogue for guards and bards, so you shouldn&#39;t have 2 installed at the same time.\r<br />It will cause longer loading screens and it might (not yet confirmed) cause an infinite loading screen. If you have 2 completely different player dialogue mods, whichever is first than the other in the loading order is what you will see.\r<br />\r<br />",
