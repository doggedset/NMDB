  "summary": "This mod simply is what the name is, it makes the dragons of skyrim increase to a more epic proportion.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I have always wanted Dragons in Skyrim to be bigger in size. I never pictured them to be these puny Lizards with wings that are in Vanilla. This Mod 2x the size of the dragons, i am currently trying to figure out how to make them roughly 3.5x-4x. If you have a solution, please let me know so i can implement and give credit.\r\n\r\nNo Major Changes Have been done. Just simply increased the scale through the Creation Kit. \r\n\r\nMany complaints about dragon riding with Dragonborn expansion. I personally don\\'t dragon ride much but i do understand the complaints. this mod is more for the people who just like fighting the dragons. It does not require any expansions other than the update. I am not proficient enough to mes with meshes yet, i am just now learning the CK. I do know the want for bigger dragons is out there, and i aim to make this mod a wonderful addition to the network.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONLY REQUIRES:\r\nSKYRIM.ESM\r\nUPDATE.ESM",
