  "summary": "Adds a powerful new shield to the game, the only way of getting it is to defeat its even more powerful owner.",
  "descriptionHtml": "**UPDATE: April 6, 2014. I&#39;ve finally gotten around to making this shield an actual piece of unique armour. New custom Texture and Mesh. (by custom, I mean NifSkoped. Not 100% custom because I still suck at Blender.)\r<br />\r<br />So, this is my first official mod, and I welcome criticism.\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a new shield ,&#34;Aegis&#39; Shield&#34; ,to the game.\r<br />\r<br />It can be found in a tower ( &#34;Sunken Tower&#34;) located south of Rorikstead, a little off the main road.\r<br />It is being wielded by an extremely powerful Orc, named Aegis gro-lugdul. You&#39;ll have to kill him to get it, which will not be easy.\r<br />\r<br />Aegis&#39;s Shield has an extremely high armour rating, and a large blocking enchantment, so to compensate, I&#39;ve made it extremely heavy (160 pounds&#33;). Only for the truest of walking tanks.\r<br />UPDATE: I&#39;ve also added a -25% stamina regeneration effect on the shield, for extra balance.\r<br />\r<br />Aegis gro-lugdul is a very powerful Orc, a master smith who has special Orcish armour that fits only his skin (it cannot be worn or even taken by the player.) And wielding a special orcish mace and of course, his shield.\r<br />\r<br />This should present the ultimate challenge and reward for a shield character.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility/installation notes: It should be as simple as copying the .esp and two files to your data folder, and there shouldn&#39;t be any incompatibilities, unless there&#39;s a mod that adds something in the exact same place in the game-world as the tower.\r<br />\r<br />Future Notes:\r<br />-I plan on adding a few small fixes (depending on what people say needs fixing)\r<br />-Possibly adding a quest into the mix\r<br />-Possibly adding a feature for you to get money for killing Aegis, like any other bounty.\r<br />\r<br />DISCLAIMER\r<br />- I do not own/did not create Skyrim (clarification: I do own a legitimate copy of the game, I&#39;m just not Bethesda), nor do I own/created the creation kit.\r<br />- This is my first mod, so you should back up your saves in case I somehow managed to do something game-breakingly wrong(which I doubt can happen with a mod as simple as this.)\r<br />          You should probably back up your saves with all mods anyways.\r<br />\r<br />CHANGELOG:\r<br />Version 1.2\r<br />- Shield now has unique Mesh and Texture\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.1\r<br />- Added a -25% stamina regeneration effect to the shield\r<br />-Improved the interior lighting\r<br />-Improved the damage and armour of Aegis gro-lugdul\r<br />NOTE: Still working on a unique shield texture.\r<br />",
