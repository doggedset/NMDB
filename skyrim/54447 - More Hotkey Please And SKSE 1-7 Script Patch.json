  "summary": "More Hot Keys Please has a script that checks the SKSE version in a way that prevents it from working correctly with the latest SKSE 1.7.0 Alpha version.  This mod has just the one script, modified to work with all versions of SKSE 1.6+.  It removes the check for the beta version.",
  "descriptionHtml": "MORE HOT KEYS PLEASE + SKSE 1.7.0 PATCH\r<br />\r<br />This mod has the one MHP script that prevented MHP from working correctly with SKSE 1.7.0.  I do not know Papyrus.  I found the solution on the MHP page, changed the script, and used the Construction Kit to compile the modified script.\r<br />\r<br />For all I know, the SKSE check only stopped me from setting a hotkey that allows me to setup a basic hotkey.  I only use MHP in for various basic hotkeys that either equip or auto-cast a spell.  So, my usage is very basic.\r<br />\r<br />Let me know if you have any other problems.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />\r<br />Install MHP and SKSE first&#33;  This zip file has a single script file (and its source file) that will over-write the following files from MHP in your Skyrim/data folder:\r<br />\r<br />Scripts/MHP_Write.pex\r<br />Scripts/Source/MHP_Write.psc\r<br />\r<br />There is no esp to activate&#33;\r<br />\r<br />UNINSTALL:\r<br />\r<br />To untinstall this mod and return to the script provided by MHP, you will need to uninstall this mod and reinstall MHP.\r<br />\r<br />DO IT YOURSELF WITH THE CK\r<br />\r<br />If you want to just make the change yourself and recompile the script, you will first need to install the SkyUI SDK 4.1 files from here: [url=https://github.com/schlangster/skyui/wiki]SkyUI Wiki[/url]\r<br />\r<br />And, of course you need to have SKSE installed correctly.\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS\r<br />\r<br />UlithiumDragon - for supplying the script solution&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/23416/?]More Hotkeys Please[/url]\r<br />[url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE[/url]\r<br />",
