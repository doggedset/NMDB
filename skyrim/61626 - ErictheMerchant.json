  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds another Merchant NPC to the game named Eric. Eric sells spell tomes and other magic items. The original version places Eric in Dragonsreach (Not a very useful place). The second version places Eric in the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood. This version of the mod is ideal for people delaying the main quest and/or want to buy spell tomes early in the game. Eric sells about the same things as Farengar, but I am open to suggestions on changes of his inventory items Â or just making a different version of ErictheMerchant to sell a different category of items. If this mod gets enough downloads and endorsements, I am considering adding a quest (Or questline) that ErictheMerchant will send you on. If you want me to add this, please download and endorse, or just comment if you do not want to download until this is added.\r<br />\r<br />This mod requires no other files or DLC to play.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Please comment any problems or suggestions that you may have.\r<br />[u]I want comments of suggestions you may have for this mod, or any opinion about the mod, so I have an idea of what to do for new versions of this mod or new mods in the future.[/u][/b]",
