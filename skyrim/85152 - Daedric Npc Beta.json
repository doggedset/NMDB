  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6]    MEHRUNES DAGON FELT HUMILIATED AFTER HIS DEFEAT\r<br />[/size]How could a mortal halt his plans of destruction of Tamriel. He has waited 200 years biding his time and waiting for an opportunity to spread chaos once more. But now with the return of the dragons he has found it. With the world focusing on the dragon crisis Mehrunes Dagon has gathered all of his worshippers and have found a way to twist reality. Promising Sheogorath the freedom of spreading insanity wherever he pleases, Sheogorath has twisted reality, creating a rift between Oblivion and Tamriel. With the Mehrune in Tamriel he discovered a shocking secret, his power was severely weakened by the rift created between the two dimensions. Sheogorath got the worst of it however and can now easily be banished by a particularly strong mortal. So Mehrune has to bide his time and wait in the plane of mortals to get his full power. However, there are enemies he did not see coming. Hircine, Nocturnal, Meridia,and Azura have also come through the rift which Mehrunes went through and are trying to save the mortal plane. Not only that, but Clavicus Vile is trying to kill Mehrunes and TAKE OVER Tamriel. Things are going to be interesting....\r<br />\r<br />Npcs that you can summon through console commands and meet in the wild include:\r<br />Meridia who has split herself up to fight necromancy all across skyrim\r<br />Nocturnal\r<br />Sheogorath\r<br />Mehrunes Dagon\r<br />Malacath\r<br />Hircine\r<br />Clavicus Vile\r<br />",
