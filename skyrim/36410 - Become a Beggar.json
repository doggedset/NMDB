  "descriptionHtml": "Become a Beggar\r<br />\r<br />Description:\r<br />This mod makes it possible to beg NPCs for coin. NPCs react to your panhandling in different ways. \r<br />\r<br />Helpful - high probability\r<br />Angry - average probability\r<br />Scared - rare chance. (Not that many people are scared of beggars.)\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />The latest skyrim title update.\r<br />\r<br />New Update:\r<br />Now you can change the amount of gold NPCs give you.\r<br />To change the amount of gold received from begging:\r<br />set beggargold to 4 (or any other number you want)\r<br />The default value is 10 if you decide not to change it.\r<br />\r<br />To change the amount of gold receive from begging with the beggar&#39;s ring equipped:\r<br />set beggarringgold to 10 (or any other number you want)\r<br />The default value is 25 if you decide not to change it.\r<br />\r<br />&#33;Update&#33;\r<br />Introducing Become a Beggar 2.0:\r<br />* I finally got randomization to work, so all trash, valuables, potions, food, soul gems, etc that you get from begging will be totally random.\r<br />* Now, when you beg from skill trainers, they share some of their knowledge with you instead of just giving you gold.\r<br />* Fixed begging limits so that they don&#39;t rely on friendship. Now this mod should be fully compatible with my give gifts to NPCs Friendship Version mod.\r<br />* I have looked into using voices from the game&#39;s generic dialog, but couldn&#39;t find any that made sense for the mod. Because of this, a voice version of this mod will not be made.\r<br />\r<br />[center]\r<br />A little Story:\r<br />\r<br />This is Bella, a khajiit cub left to fend for herself in the harsh environment of Skyrim. She has just arrived in Riften, and has a room at Helga&#39;s bunkhouse. Since she has little skills and little food, she starts begging for coin to buy her next meal.\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i1367.photobucket.com/albums/r781/MimiTheAlchemist/Skyrim%20Mods/Become%20A%20Beggar/beggerBella_zps3f0d9ebb.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />While walking around the market district, she met a dodgy man selling some miracle elixir. As he began to approach her, she ran away. That was when she bumped into Drifa. She put on the saddest face a khajiit cub can make and begged for some coin.\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i1367.photobucket.com/albums/r781/MimiTheAlchemist/Skyrim%20Mods/Become%20A%20Beggar/bellabegdrifa_zpsf23bf9a6.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />She looked at the shiny coins in her hand and thought about dinner. Was it going to be salmon or slaughterfish? Both sounded yummy. After a meal which consisted of 2 raw salmon, Bella spotted a fellow beggar, Snilf shouting insults above the market noise. She thought, &#34;What do I have to lose? and asked snilf to share some of his earnings.\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i1367.photobucket.com/albums/r781/MimiTheAlchemist/Skyrim%20Mods/Become%20A%20Beggar/bellabegsnilf_zps1a18da53.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />He&#39;s a beggar himself&#33; :-) How rude&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i1367.photobucket.com/albums/r781/MimiTheAlchemist/Skyrim%20Mods/Become%20A%20Beggar/bellabegsnilf2_zpseb5115fd.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />After Snilf&#39;s rude verbal assault, he had the audacity to throw trash at Bella. What&#39;s a khajiit kid to do? After a couple of days begging, Bella finally got enough gold to take the carriage to Whiterun.\r<br />She had always wanted to go there. It was famous for its scenic beauty and hospitable residents. What&#39;s not to like?\r<br />\r<br />After taking a tour around Whiterun, Bella&#39;s stomach started to growl. She had spent all her gold on the carriage ride. Now, she&#39;s too broke to buy food. While eyeing the food at Carlotta&#39;s stand, Bella notices Nazeem. He looked like he would have lots of coin to spare, so she politely asked if he could spare some septims. \r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i1367.photobucket.com/albums/r781/MimiTheAlchemist/Skyrim%20Mods/Become%20A%20Beggar/bellabegcoward1_zps7f5e5ccf.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />He thought Bella was some kind of highwayman. Bella couldn&#39;t believe he gave up his valuables so easily. She then felt guilty for taking them. She was just a beggar after all, not a thief. She tugged on his expensive clothes and offered to return his valuables.\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i1367.photobucket.com/albums/r781/MimiTheAlchemist/Skyrim%20Mods/Become%20A%20Beggar/bellabegcoward2_zps3c11d25c.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />Bella couldn&#39;t believe he was so generous. He seemed like such a snob. Was he a nice guy, or did he take pity on her. Things like that didn&#39;t really matter to Bella. After she sold Nazeem&#39;s valuables, Bella had enough gold to travel all over skyrim. &#34;Oh, the places I&#39;ll see... and the gold I&#39;ll make from begging all the people in Skyim.&#34;, Bella thought as she munched happily on a feast of salmon and slaughterfish.\r<br />\r<br />The end.\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i1367.photobucket.com/albums/r781/MimiTheAlchemist/Skyrim%20Mods/Become%20A%20Beggar/didyouknow_zps6df110dc.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />Did you know?\r<br />\r<br />* The people who give you gold get the &#34;gift of charity&#34; blessing. *\r<br />* The people who give you trash get a disease called &#34;the rattles&#34;. Sweet Revenge&#33; *\r<br />* Helpful people who give you coin become your friends. *\r<br />* Angry people who throw garbage at you become your enemies. *\r<br />* Those Angry NPCs that tell you to &#34;Get a job.&#34; throw job-related clutter at you. *\r<br />* Random fact: Bella is the name of my eleven year old american shorthair cat.*\r<br />\r<br />[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][IMG]http://static1.nexusmods.com/110/mods/images/36410-1-1373133990.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center]\r<br /> \r<br />Become A Highwayman\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37545\r<br />\r<br />Become A Skooma Dealer\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37404\r<br />\r<br />Become A Skill Trainer\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38118\r<br />\r<br />[/center]",
