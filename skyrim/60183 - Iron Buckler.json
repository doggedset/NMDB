  "summary": "This mod adds a brand new and unique looking shield to the game. The mesh and textures were all made by me completely from scratch.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a new, custom modelled shield to the game, called the &#39;Iron Buckler&#39;. It doesn&#39;t have any special enchantments, so you can customise it however you prefer (if you want to). It can be crafted at the forge, and can also be tempered at a workbench. It is slightly smaller than other vanilla shields, so therefore weighs less than other &#39;heavy&#39; shields, but is a bit heavier than &#39;light&#39; shields. Also it is not overly powerful - with a base armor rating of 22, it makes it slightly stronger than the elven shield.\r<br />\r<br />This mod comes with [size=4]support for Dual Sheath Redux[/size], so no need to make a patch for it yourself&#33; (if you don&#39;t have Dual Sheath Redux, it doesn&#39;t matter, it won&#39;t cause any problems)\r<br />\r<br />Installation: Just install how you would any other mod using your favourite mod manager, or, extract the contents of the archive into your Skyrim data folder (this includes the esp, meshes, and textures folders).\r<br />\r<br />Also, I&#39;d like to thank Matthiaswagg who gave me the task of designing this shield for his upcoming mod &#39;Immersive Quests&#39;. Unfortunately, it won&#39;t be in his mod anymore, so instead I&#39;m releasing it as a standalone shield mod for you all to enjoy :) Hope you like it&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The armor I&#39;m wearing in the images is the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/43649/?]Hunter Archer Armor[/url] - I really recommend you go and check it out&#33; :)",
