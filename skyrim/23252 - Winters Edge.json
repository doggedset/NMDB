  "descriptionHtml": "*Read note Before updating*\r\n\r\nWinter\\'s Edge is Player Home with copious amounts of storage space and displays. Its separated into two parts, the house and the basement. The house is more for your companions, having been built with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18045]My Home Is Your Home[/url] in mind. The Basement includes a smithy, enchanting and alchemy stands, chest room, library, displays for shields, weapons, daggers, and armor, \\\"Owned\\\" player bed, and an archery lane. The displays all come empty.  \r\n\r\nCurrently there are no quests or balancing agents of any kind, so while I did not make this as a cheat mod, its a free house. I might fix that later, though that\\'s a big maybe.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n*Remove everything from first floor displays before updating to 1.2 or higher*\r\nIf you didn\\'t do that, either revert to 1.1 and then remove them, or use \\\"tcl\\\" to go through the wall and get your stuff off the walls.\r\n\r\nThere are many mannequins in the basement. If you have a mod that changes their behavior, it can cause your game to crash due to the scripts all being run at once. That\\'s really only an issue on lower end machines.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n1.3\r\nFixed Cell resetting\r\nFixed Chest near basement ladder respawning\r\nAdded weapon rack on tree by the chopping block\r\nTweaked Smithy\r\n\r\n1.2\r\nFixed clipping and positioning issues\r\nAdded small chests to library\r\nAdded plaques to the library\r\nAdded barrel for food on 1st floor\r\nAdded 2 small chests to second floor\r\nAdded wooden walls to fix weapons on plaques clipping into stone walls\r\nAdded a few more idle markers\r\nAdded table to basement\r\nAdded woodpiles around outside\r\nAdded/tweaked outside lighting\r\n\r\n1.1\r\nremoved a bush sticking out of a rock\r\nadded light to a fire\r\nadded more exterior lights\r\nkilled bug causing hundreds of chests across Skyrim to be labeled \\\"Merchant Chest\\\" and have no loot\r\n(sorry about that last one)\r\nminor navmesh tweaks\r\nmoved map marker so if you fast travel on a horse it doesn\\'t end up on the door step",
