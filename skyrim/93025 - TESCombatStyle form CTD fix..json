  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#f9cb9c]Hello again. After over 8,000 hours of wandering Skyrim and all that time being plagued by mysterious CTDs while simply walking the land, I had nearly become so sick of them that I contemplated uninstalling Skyrim. [/color][b][color=#ffe599]Then I found a very nice mod called \"Crash Fixes\" by \"meh21\" ([/color][color=#00ffff]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72725/[/color][color=#ffe599]) that remedied quite a few old CTD demons while also doing an equally useful service of pointing out offending NPCs and objects causing CTD events. [/color][/b][color=#b6d7a8]Thanks for that, meh21.\n<br />\n<br />[/color][color=#a2c4c9]After loading TES5Edit and typing in the ID number that \"Crash Fixes\" supplied me with, I was directed to an odd looking template for a spawn point for ambient creatures. Namely, a shifty looking fox and snow fox. [/color][color=#a4c2f4]After reading through their files, I noticed they used a template for something that wasn't a fox or snow fox. [/color][color=#ff7700][b]This was what was causing the CTD events.\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/color][color=#93c47d]My mod remedies this by using the correct template for the actor and after a full playthrough, I haven't had anymore CTD events caused by these shifty looking foxes.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff00ff]Only requirement is Skyrim.esm. [/color][color=#e06666]Does not require \"Crash Fixes\".[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000]A side effect I've been notified of will no longer allow rabbits to spawn while using my fix. [/color][color=#00ff00]Bethesda's hand-placed locations like Spriggan lairs and some shrines still spawn rabbits.[/color][color=#ff0000] [/color]Adding the rabbit's record to any other \"LCharAnimalxPrey\" spawn list using \"TES5Edit\" will also add rabbits back to the world.\n<br />\n<br />[/b][color=#00ff00][size=4][b]Hot files 8-13-2018 to 8-19-18! Thanks for that!\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/size][/color][b][size=3]Skyrim SE port by ff7legend. ([color=#00ffff]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19265[/color])[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00]Thanks for looking, I hope this helps you all as well as it has me.[/color]",
