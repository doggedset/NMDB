  "summary": "Appearance change for Rayya (Lakeview Housecarl)",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is the way I like her. I didn\\'t make her for The Nexus. I made her for me. \r\n\r\nNothing special. I hated the Rayya that Bethesda shacked us up with. So much so that I always sacrificed her to Boethia. So I thought I\\'d share. People say sharing is caring.\r\n\r\nThis mod changes her appearance and voice only.\r\n\r\n-She\\'s wearing Serana\\'s outfit, red makeup.\r\n-Removed her Scimitars and replaced it with an Ebony Sword.\r\n-She is a Nord now and gave her the \\\"young and eager\\\" female voice, and female movement.\r\n(I use [url=\\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36286//?\\\"]Feminine Females[/url] by NemesisTheWarlock, but she should have female animations now anyway.\r\n\r\nNamed her Amy Lee. I love Amy Lee. I want to marry Amy Lee and have Amy Lee babies.\r\nIf you really hate that name I\\'ll change it back to Rayya.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\nDawnguard for Serana\\'s outfit,\r\nHearthfire.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nJust drop the esp in your .../Skyrim/Data folder\r\n\r\n\r\n============================================================================\r\n\r\nCheck out my other mods Â  \r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37715//?]Lakeview Manor Overhaul[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37229//?]Honeyside Facelift[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36751//?]Proudspire Makeover (W.I.P)[/url]",
