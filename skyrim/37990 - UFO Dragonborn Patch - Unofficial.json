  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][size=15][b]UFO Dragonborn Patch - Unofficial[/b][/size][/heading]\r\n\r\nNote: for UFO v1.2i ONLY.\r\nNOT for Vamyan's new 1.2j UFO. As of 1.2j UFO should support Dragonborn without this patch.\r\n\r\nExtends [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037/?]UFO[/url] functionality to the 4 followers added by the Dragonborn DLC. Dragonborn followers can now join/be dismissed by the player, be told to wait/follower and gain all of the extended follower functionality that [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037/?]UFO[/url] adds including multiple followers.\r\n\r\nAnimal followers have not been touched... but it doesn't look like [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/1265248/?]fLokii[/url] touched the vanilla animal followers either.\r\n\r\nNone of [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/1265248/?]fLokii[/url]'s original files or scripts have been edited or included in this patch. \r\n\r\nThis patch REQUIRES the Dragonborn DLC AND [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037/?]UFO - Ultimate Follower Overhaul[/url] by [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/1265248/?]fLokii[/url] to be installed and active. Load after [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037/?]UFO[/url] and official [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037/?]UFO[/url] patches.\r\n\r\nNote: Patch edits script DLC2_QF_DLC2MQ04_020179DE as during the quest \"The Gardener of Men\", Frea, if a follower, gets auto dismissed.\r\nAlso included is a modified tif_udbpfix_0217a50b, added by the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31083//?]Unofficial Dragonborn Patch[/url]. This relates to Talvas Fathryon's dismissal dialog overwriting Onmund's. If the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31083//?]Unofficial Dragonborn Patch[/url] patch is installed then the new [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037/?]UFO[/url] compatible [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31083//?]UDBP[/url] script will be used, if not then a patched version of the original dismissal script will be used instead.\r\n\r\nAll credit for the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037/?]UFO[/url] mod goes to its original author, [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/1265248/?]fLokii[/url]. Heres hoping all is well and he returns to modding soon.\r\n\r\nTo [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/1265248/?]fLokii[/url], if you wish this mod removed for *any* reason please PM me and it will be removed asap.\r\n\r\nCurrently available translations:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38054//?]Espa√±ol@nexus[/url]\r\n??????? ??????@Tesall.ru\r\n\r\n[heading][size=5][b]IMPORTANT INFO REGARDING \"Dawnguard Serana Patch\"[/b][/size][/heading]\r\nThis is an experimental fix for Serana, the follower added by the Dawnguard DLC. Unlike all other followers in Skyrim she uses a unique system to control her follower status. This system is missing some faction assignments, this breaks some of UFO's functionality.\r\nThis patch fixes that and allows, for example, [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037/?]UFO[/url]'s \"You know...\" dialogue options to show. Not all of the extra dialogue options work however, things like relax and combat/sneak/AI/setEssential don't do anything. But spell learning and inventory unlocking(but not Serana's hood) is working.\r\nThe fix only kicks in after the main Dawnguard quest has been completed. This is to prevent potential game breaking conflicts. The mod has not been extensively tested but is logically sound. Make a save before installing this patch in case anything bad happens. (and if something does break please report it) If you wish to remove this patch, please dismiss Serana and confirm the \"You know..\" dialogue does not appear before deactivating/removing.\r\n\r\n[b]Extra Techy Info on Dawnguard Serana Patch[/b]\r\nSerana is not treated the same way as all the other followers in Skyrim and has code hooks all over the main Dawnguard quest line. I couldn't find an easy way to hook her scripts into the rest of the follower system without potentially breaking all sorts of things. So I've modified Serana's \"DLC1_NPCMentalModelScript\" to set the extra factions needed to have her register as a proper follower. [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23491//?]UDGP[/url] fixes applied to \"DLC1_NPCMentalModelScript\" have been applied to the patch. Removing this patch mid-game should not cause any game breaking problems. At worst you will get 2 errors in the papyrus log.\r\n[heading][/heading]\r\n\r\n[heading][size=5][b]Dialog-Priority[/b][/size][/heading]\r\nThis is a totally optional file that will move the \"I need to trade some things with you\" dialogue line closer to the top of the list. (Should put it just below the \"You know..\" line.) Its a small patch, barely worth the esp, but might save you some scrolling.\r\n\r\nThis patch doesn't require UFO or any other mod but is tailored to UFO.\r\n\r\nIts really easy to move the lines about by just changing the PNUM - Priority in TES5EDIT relative to other entries. ConvenientHorses is 80, UFO's You know is 70, a spouses \"has the store..?\" line is 50 and the trade inventory line is by default 25. (and My Home is Your Home is 15) ",
