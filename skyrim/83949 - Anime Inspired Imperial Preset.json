  "summary": "An anime inspired and more feminine male preset for everyone else out there who likes their male characters to be more feminine in appearance, as apposed to all the big beefcake Nords. It was designed to be more of a femboy preset for my own personal use, as I don&#39;t like masculine male characters.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This preset was designed to be very anime inspired in appearance, as well as being far more feminine in the looks. I designed this preset simply because I don&#39;t like masculine characters, but I do like feminine cute male characters instead. There&#39;s not a whole lot of mods that suit a guy with my kinds of tastes, so I hope this mod will help anyone who is also looking for feminine male mods as well.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />You don&#39;t need Schlongs of Skyrim, but it&#39;s a rather large component of the preset, in my opinion. I also have no idea how it&#39;ll look without it.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements to look like the above pictures:\r<br />\r<br />Eyes: Fair Skin Complexion \r<br />By HHaleyy\r<br />\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51602/?\r<br />\r<br />Hair: KS hairdos \r<br />By Kalilies Stealthic Khaos and Shocky \r<br />\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68311/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D68311&pUp=1\r<br />\r<br />Tattoos: KJ Tattoos\r<br />By Khajiitas\r<br />\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50032/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Face Textures: Fine Face Textures for Men\r<br />By Urshi\r<br />\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51602/?\r<br />\r<br />Body Textures: Schlongs of Skyrim\r<br />By VectorPlexus and Smurf\r<br />\r<br />You&#39;ll also of course need RaceMenu by Expired for the preset to work at all.\r<br />\r<br />If you don&#39;t have any of these I don&#39;t have a clue as to how he&#39;ll look once you get into the game.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />\r<br />Simply find your Skyrim directory, look for your SKSE folder, go into Plugins, open CharGen, and drop my preset into the folder. Simple&#33; :)",
