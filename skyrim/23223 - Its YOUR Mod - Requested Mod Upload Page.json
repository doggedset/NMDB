The amount of firewood depends on your level. At level 1, blacksmiths sell up to 25 firewood every 2 days. However if you manage to get to level 60, they sell up to 175 firewood every 2 days. All levels in between have amount of firewood also. In addition if you complete the civil war quest line, the tree fellers of Skyrim feel more confident going out into the wild to chop down wood, so there is up to a 100% increase in wood. This means you could be getting up to 350 firewood every 2 days per blacksmith.\r\n[/color]\r\n[color=##00FF00]\r\n[*]Mod Number 2: Janus Hassildor\r\nThis mod adds a 300 year old vampire to the game Janus Hassildor, who is featured in Oblivion. He can be found around Solitude and has no requirements to have. His favourite attack style is Magic (Destruction mostly) but will change to any style accordingly. He also has unique armour for his default outfit and has a total level of 76.\r\n[/color]\r\n[color=##00FFFF]\r\n[*]Mod Number 3: Enhanced Crafting Items\r\nThis mod adds two chests that can be found throughout Tamriel.\r\nThe first chest can be found by reading a book located on the Blacksmiths table in Riverwood. It explains that a merchant had dropped these rare items into the river after riding over a tone on his carriage. There are  4 Smithing items and 5 Alchemy items that boost their corresponding  skill by 15%.\r\nThe second chest is owned by the Solitude Blacksmith and can be found upstairs by his bedroom. His chest contains the same items but in an Enhanced version. These are worth twice as much gold and boots the corresponding stats by 20%.\r\n[/color]\r\n[/list]",
