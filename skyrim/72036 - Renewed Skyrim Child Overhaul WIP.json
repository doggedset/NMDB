Make sure you have a save file well away from any place children are, or else there might be some issues as I&#39;ve altered some of their clothing. Once loaded with the mod, everything should be fine.\r<br />\r<br />An overhaul of the children, adding morphs, new clothes and children of the Mer kind, to create better immersion.\r<br />\r<br />Now this mod began a while ago. The goal was simple. Can I make an elven child mod, that retains the vanilla aesthetic. It would be simple, just alter the default child .nif and give it pointed ears.\r<br />\r<br />Doing this caused issues, of course, but since I had worked with .tri&#39;s before I decided to see if I could create morphs to create the elven children. Turns out I could. With six eye morphs, I patted myself on the back.\r<br />\r<br />But I wasn&#39;t satisfied with that. I expanded it to the vanilla children, creating a set of morphs (that took forever, and still have a few issues) that covered everything that the adult morphs had.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />There are a few children mods out there. This is a video showcases some of them.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Cells affected by this mod\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim:\r<br />-Mor Khazghur longhouse, mine and exterior\r<br />-Dushnikh Yal Longhouse and exterior.\r<br />-New Gnisis Corner Club \r<br />-Atheron Household \r<br />-Radient Raiment\r<br />Â \r<br />Dragonborn (Raven Rock)\r<br />-Ienth Farm\r<br />-Crescius Residence\r<br />-Retching Netch.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This mod is not compatible with any mod that affects children.\r<br />\r<br />I hope I remembered all the files. If I forgot any, then there might be issues.\r<br />\r<br />FAQ\r<br />\r<br />1 Q-Can you make a patch/make it so I can use it with x child mod.\r<br />A-This is unlikely. Mainly because they use the vanilla children&#39;s assets. They are tied together, and to separate them would require a lot of additional work.\r<br />\r<br />Anticipated Questions\r<br />\r<br />1 Q-Why don&#39;t the Orc kids speak?\r<br />A-Because a human child voice coming out of an Orc child sounds stupid.\r<br />\r<br />2 Q-Some of them are ugly.\r<br />A-That&#39;s not very nice. Besides, I tried with greater or lesser success (you decide) to try and make them look like their parents.\r<br />\r<br />3 Q-I think there should be more Orc children in the strongholds, and more than just in two.\r<br />A-I know of one that&#39;s under attack, so I wanted to avoid that one, and another has a weak old chief, who&#39;s youngest daughter (It&#39;s implied) is an adult. Also, I didn&#39;t want to risk breaking things with adding too many.\r<br />\r<br />4 Q-Their textures are bad.\r<br />A-Sorry. I&#39;m not really a texture guy. I did the best I could.\r<br />\r<br />5 Q-The Dunmer eyes in the images are too grey/gray&#33;\r<br />A- I use an eye texture mod I should have uninstalled before taking those screenshots. They use whatever eye/brow/hair/teeth textures the adults use.\r<br />\r<br />6 Q-Not as good as X child mod&#33;&#33;&#33;11\r<br />A-Use whatever mod you feel is right for you. ",
