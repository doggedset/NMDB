  "modName": "ex vita libre",
  "summary": "Over powered god items. Kinda cool, not too lore friendly though. Has no dependancies that I\\'m aware of; dlc, skse, other mods or otherwise.",
  "descriptionHtml": "My first mod uploaded, anywhere - ever.\r\n\r\nIt includes occult themes, blood and gore\r\nand most importantly - poor taste. If you\r\nloath any of these things, please don\\'t\r\nread any further\r\n\r\n**************************************************************\r\nIn short (for those who don\\'t like to read):\r\n\r\nJust drop the file in your Data folder or\r\nhopefully NMM will do it for you. If you have\r\nor as soon as you commit murder, the first\r\nitem will be available to be crafted under\r\nthe Daedric smithing category. No preks\r\nrequired. After you make the first item, all\r\nyou need is it equipped and 1000 human\r\nskulls to craft the second item the same way.\r\n\r\nOr use your console - \\\"help vita\\\" will show\r\nyou the item number for the first one,\r\n\\\"help brarum\\\" will show you the second one.\r\nThen type in \\\"player.additem XXXXXXXX 1\\\" to\r\nget that item. (Gotta do it twice to get both.\r\nThere is a space between the m of additem\r\nand the first number of the item code, then\r\nanother space between the last number of\r\nthe item code and the 1 (that\\'s how many of\r\nthe item you want). No quotations.\r\n**************************************************************\r\n\r\nGet bored and frustrated with the daily\r\nSkyrim grind? Those pesky couriers and rude\r\ntownsfolk just rub you the wrong way? Well,\r\nfret no more! Anyone can become a serial\r\nkiller! All you have to do is kill more than\r\none person and you make the cut! :D\r\n\r\nWhat this mod does is offer a two fold gift.\r\nIt\\'s in thanks for ridding the land of one\r\nmouth peice it could do without and a tool\r\nfor taking out many, many more!\r\n\r\nIn order to get it, you need only pay the\r\nsmall shipping and handling fee from Hell\r\nPost Direct! Six human hearts, six pieces of\r\nhuman flesh and six filled black soul gems.\r\n(Grand souls please, but technically that\r\nwould just be a tip..)\r\n\r\nWhat you get is the \\\"..ex vita libre,\\\" which\r\ngoogle tells me is \\\"..leave this life\\\" in Latin.\r\nIf anyone more educated than myself\r\nknows this to be incorrect, please let me\r\nknow and I\\'ll correct it. Not Spanish (which\r\nis a fine language in all it\\'s modulations,\r\ndon\\'t get me wrong) but the old dead\r\nlanguage of Latin.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s a translucent bow with ethereal flames\r\ncrackling all around it. I highly reccomend\r\nenchanting it with \\\"magicka arrows,\\\" which\r\nyou can unlock with the fine work of\r\nMr./Miss (don\\'t know) Blazie151:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29059/?\r\n\r\nIf you like it, let us know! It\\'s not horribly\r\nover powered, but provide us with your\r\nfirst 1000 trophies (human skulls  - while we\r\nabsolutely love the souls you sent us, we\\'re\r\noddly at a shortage of mason jars..) and the\r\nbow that claimed them and we will send\r\nyou the \\\"Tenebrarum Amplexus.\\\" (The\r\nEmbrace of Darkness) It will one shot anyone\r\nor anything on the continent! You will\r\nfeel and hear the difference before you fire\r\neven your first arrow! It also has very\r\nimpressive range and is three times faster!\r\n\r\n**************************************************************\r\n\r\nMessage to other modders:\r\n\r\nYou may call it trolling, but I call it a great\r\nopportunity to learn stuff from people smarter\r\nthan me. Absolutely tell me what I\\'m doing\r\nwrong and how to \\\"doo it gooder!\\\" If you\\'re\r\nfeeling particularly trolly that is.\r\n\r\nI can say with a fair amount of certainty that\r\nI have roughly 10% of the tallent of the second\r\ncrappiest modder who has ever lived. If I\\'m wrong\r\nabout that, I\\'m prolly being too generous. With\r\nthat being said, I\\'m reading the forrums right now;\r\nlooking for answers to the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. With Nif files who\\'s textures are not included\r\n(given by some other part of the game), how do\r\nI manage to change the way they look? Blue\r\nflames are cool, but not very Hell like in my mind.\r\nThough I am 110% totally lacking in any kind of\r\n\\\"belief\\\" of any kind, occult/tabboo stuff has\r\nalways had a special place in my heart because\r\nof how much it pisses everyone else off.\r\n\r\n2. Is there a bestiary of all the stuff in all the\r\ndrop down menus of the Creation Kit? Between\r\nYahoo and Google I can get by though.\r\n\r\n3. How to add the unique enchantment magicka\r\narrows to this so it\\'s there right out of the box,\r\nyet players can also ad their own enchantments\r\nto it at a table with no issues.\r\n\r\nI used nothing but files that where already\r\navailable with the basic install sans DLC.\r\n\r\nI play this game frequently, if you want to IM me,\r\nI\\'m \\\"Fumble Fett\\\" on Steam. I\\'m always online so\r\nshoot me a message if you want and don\\'t worry\r\nabout bothering me.\r\n\r\nI read the whole \\\"Terms and Conditions\\\" section\r\nand it was pretty clear about \\\"teasing\\\" so I won\\'t\r\nget into what I\\'ve got planned with this mod, but\r\nI do plan on putting alot more work into it. Any\r\nsuggestions or help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n",
