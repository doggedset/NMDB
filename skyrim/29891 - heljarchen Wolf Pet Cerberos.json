  "modName": "heljarchen Wolf Pet Cerberos",
  "summary": "Adds a Wolf Pet with white fur and blue eyes named Cerberos to your heljarchen home (Might work with console spawn at other homes)\r\n\r\nFollow, Wait, Trade, Dismiss commands.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[color=red]NOTE:\r\n\r\nRequires Dawnguard AND Heartfires in order to load, sorry.[/color] (it might not but give it a try)\r\n\r\nAdds:\r\n\r\n6 required scripts for the dialogue to work.\r\n1 custom mesh (need for custom texture)\r\n1 custom texture\r\n1 esp file\r\n\r\nAbout Cerberos & Commands:\r\n\r\nWhere is he at?\r\n\r\nHe is by the side of the door at heljarchen (to the right)\r\n\r\nHe is .2 bigger than the rest of the wolves and has different textures. (good size for me)\r\n\r\nHe is marked as \\\\\\\"Essential\\\\\\\" meaning that he will take damage but not die, health bar will go down but when it reaches 0 he will not die.\r\n\r\nThe wolf has the following commands:\r\n\r\nFollow me: Cerberos will follow you like a dog, you can have another companion follow you as well.\r\n\r\nWait: Cerberos will wait for you anywhere you want, will protect any friends or allies that are in trouble while you are away.\r\n\r\nGive me everything you got, Dog: Cerberos will open up his inventory window so you can trade items (I will make it so that he can pick up items as well later on)\r\n\r\nTime to go home: Will send Cerberos back to heljarchen (or any other home which you spawned him at)\r\n\r\nNote that every command has a sound, usually a bark and when you dismiss Cerberos he will Howl just like a regular wolf.\r\n\r\nKNOWN BUGS:\r\n\r\n- Ghost Barks: Because the animations are borrowed from the dog animations some of the barks while Cerberos is idle are not there, personally this is not a biggie for me.",
