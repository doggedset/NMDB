  "summary": "Followers will begin to explore the area if you&#39;re boring, similar to Serana from Dawnguard.",
  "descriptionHtml": "DESCRIPTION:\r<br />\r<br />Followers will explore the area on their own if you bore them by not moving for a while, like Serana does. Also, when you tell them to wait, they’ll explore as well, and perhaps eat or sleep.\r<br />\r<br />REQUIREMENTS:\r<br />\r<br />A working copy of the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />\r<br />Place the contents of the .7z file in your &#34;Data&#34; folder, which is usually located under Steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />The ReadMe document and the .bsl file are not required for the mod to run -- you may keep them or discard them.\r<br />\r<br />UNINSTALLATION:\r<br />\r<br />Enter &#34;StopQuest PSFollowerIdleExplore&#34; into the console (sans quotation marks), wait a moment (until &#34;sqv PSFollowerIdleExplore&#34; indicates the quest has stopped) to end the quest and stop it from running updates.\r<br />\r<br />Then you may delete the included .esp and .bsa file.\r<br />\r<br />The nature of Skyrim’s scripting language, Papyrus, means that, even following this procedure, your Papyrus log will continue to throw errors about missing scripts, potentially leading to save game bloat. There is, lamentably, nothing that I can do about this -- you have been warned.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATING:\r<br />\r<br />Replace all older files with newer versions. If in doubt, replace all mod files with the contents of the latest uploaded archive.\r<br />\r<br />No in-game configuration is necessary.\r<br />\r<br />BUGS:\r<br />\r<br />As of yet, none.\r<br />\r<br />COMPATIBILITY:\r<br />\r<br />This mod will not work with any mod that entails allowing one to recruit multiple followers. I have, however, received reports that some multiple follower mods do work with this mod but only affect the first-recruited follower.\r<br />\r<br />Other than the above cases, this mod will be compatible with practically any other mod.",
