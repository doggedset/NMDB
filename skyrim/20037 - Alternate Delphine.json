  "descriptionHtml": "Description\r<br />============\r<br />\r<br />After many a play-through. I was getting tired of seeing the same ol&#39; Delphine, and her ugly butch mug. So I searched the nexus for a better version, however the only other person that edited her, made her too young and model-like for my taste. \r<br />\r<br />So for the first time I decided to make my own version. \r<br />\r<br />She is slightly younger, but not young enough to be a whelp, but also not old enough to have a stroke while swinging her sword. She has her share of scars, which In my mind she is quite proud of. I gave her as very little make-up as possible, because I doubt someone like her would use very much, if any. However I feel improving her overall looks was a must.\r<br />\r<br />Disclaimer\r<br />============\r<br />\r<br />This is MY idea of Delphine. If you do not like how she looks, that is fine. Please move on. If you do like how she looks, then well done you, and I am happy we have slightly similar tastes. I simply wish to share this so that other people have the option between butch and super fake model. Also this is my first ever submission so if something is broken or whatever please let me know. I will say, that I installed this myself using NMM and it worked perfectly. That is my recommendation as well, it makes it super easy to install/uninstall.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Required & Recommended Mods\r<br />=============\r<br />\r<br />1. ApachiiSkyHair by Apachii ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168 ) v1.4 Full (Required)\r<br />\r<br />2. ApachiiSkyHair Retexture by Bloodysunday.  ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10357 ) To have the same texture. v1.4 Wild Look. (Recommended)\r<br />\r<br />3. I use Better Females by Bella by BellaGail (eyebrows) ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812 ) (Recommended)\r<br />\r<br />4. The Eyes Of Beauty by Gabriel Mailhot ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722 ) (Recommended)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />True to Skyrim Version requires no additional mods. So it is strictly plug and play.\r<br />\r<br />Look at screenshot labels for comparison.\r<br />\r<br />If you switch from the Apachii dependant versions (Original, and Darker hair/Older) to the True to Skyrim version, make sure to remove the .BSA file as it is not needed. If you used NMM to install the file, simply uninstall it and install the True to Skyrim version.\r<br />",
