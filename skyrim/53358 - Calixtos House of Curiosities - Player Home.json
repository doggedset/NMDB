Thanks to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/9837312/?]skyf0rger[/url] for the idea&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The file has been cleaned with TES5EDIT, does not require any DLC, is fully navmeshed and has no scripts, so it should be safe for everybody to use. Still, you should always make a backup save before installing ANY mod, in case something goes wrong.\r<br />\r<br />As I have done with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48850/?]some[/url] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/39119/?]other[/url] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/39517/?]mods[/url] that turn quest locations into player homes, all the triggers have been left intact and the door simply links to a different cell, instead of the original one. It is possible to enable the mod without having done the quest [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Blood_on_the_Ice]Blood on the Ice[/url], although I wouldn&#39;t recommend it, as the original door of the cell is now underground so any NPCs entering or leaving the original cell with have trouble.\r<br />\r<br />I left most of the loot from the original cell around, so you won&#39;t miss them if you go in without having done the quest. The house is fully navmeshed but pretty bare-bones, with a couple of bookcases, a bed, a bedroll for a follower and some display - a couple of display plaques, a case, a mannequin and some weapon racks. There are alchemy and enchanting stations, as well as a sharpening wheel, workbench and anvil. All containers are safe and will not respawn.\r<br />\r<br />To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use the Mod Manager to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Now, for the credits:\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16525/?]Modders Resource Pack[/url] by Oaristys and Tony67.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14133/?]FoodContainer[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14135]BookSets[/url] Resources by Blary.\r<br />- [url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1264-catering-by-lilith/]Catering[/url] and [url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1300-ready-clutter-and-furnishings/]Ready Clutter and Furnishings 1.1[/url] by Lilith.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1869302/Skyrim/Banners/Knotwork.png[/img][/center]",
