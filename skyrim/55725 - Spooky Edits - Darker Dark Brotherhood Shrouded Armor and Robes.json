  "descriptionHtml": "[color=Lightsteelblue][b]Description :[/b][/color] Two variants of the dark brotherhood armor / robe sets to hopefully make them more assassin worthy :). I did a lot of editing to the vanilla female version of this armor to make these, so even if you are not a fan of the dark you could grab a version with just those edits [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55809/]here[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[color=Lightsteelblue][b]AIO : [/b][/color]Makes the Worn Shrouded Armor set use my reworked vanilla female texture fixes and the vanilla male texture (with de-saturated gauntlet studs), Shrouded Armor use the There Will Be Blood textures and Ancient Shrouded Armor uses the Ninja Assassin textures. There is an optional Ancient Ninja Armor file that can be used alongside v0.4 There Will Be Blood textures if you don&#39;t want the worn textures. Also I included the male torso mesh with bandana from the Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Patch in 0.51 to resolve the conflict it was giving me in my own game.\r<br />\r<br />[color=Lightsteelblue][b]Optional Normal Map Fix :[/b][/color] An updated version is included in versions 0.2 and above\r<br />\r<br />[color=Lightsteelblue][b]Lossless Versions :[/b][/color] These 24/32bit versions give a nicer depth to the textures and should be free from any artifacts, but are much more memory intensive so if you are already low on V-RAM then avoid :). \r<br />\r<br />[color=Lightsteelblue][b]Screenshots :[/b][/color] I always use the lossless versions of my textures alongside an edited [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30936/?/]RealVision Nova ENB[/url] with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27043/?/]Enhanced Lights And FX[/url].

I feel like I am a lot closer to what I want for the red version with this release.\r<br />\r<br />- Edited / created new spec maps for every texture since I was finding it all a bit too shiny for my tastes, especially the studs.\r<br />\r<br />- Painted over most of the bright spots on the red sections for the armor textures since they were a bit glow in the dark-ish.\r<br />\r<br />- De-saturated all of the male studs since I figured it was probably a bug like the vanilla female ones were; the odd one or two were coloured on one side and not the other.\r<br />\r<br />- Removed the crotch and bum studs on the male armor since they were a bit smelly and odd shaped (one of the crotch ones looked almost heart shaped in game.... lol)\r<br />\r<br />- Fixed some seams up the back of the male torso, the belt being the most obvious.\r<br />\r<br />- Made the female red more like the male... then fixed the male gloves and boots to also be more like the male :P\r<br />\r<br />- tweaking and tweaking and tweaking :) <br/> \n",
