  "summary": "Sets Embershard mine to be the target of Favor 154, the quest to purchase the Falkreath HF House.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Hearthfire Required. Works with SSE.\r<br />\r<br />Starting a new game ? \r<br />\r<br />When you go into Falkreath to get the Lakeview Manor quest, do you save and reload until you get the location you want ?\r<br />Tired of having to hump it out to Bilegulch Mine ? Worried about potential conflicts or respawn times with Knifepoint Ridge and the Boethiah Daedric Quest ?\r<br />\r<br />This mod is for you.\r<br />\r<br />It adds a variable for Favor 154 (quest to qualify to buy Lakeside)  that makes it calculate Embershard mine every time. That&#39;s it. Makes no other changes.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Should be compatible with everything except changes to &#34;Favor154&#34;. Recommended for a new game. Have not tested with Embershard already cleared, but it should cause the cell to reset and place the &#34;Bandit Leader&#34; there.\r<br />\r<br />Installation: Place Favor154.esp in Data folder and activate. Load order should not matter, let LOOT decide.\r<br />\r<br />Feel free to redistribute/ merge into your personal tweaks/ share or otherwise enjoy.",
