  "summary": "If you side with the Volkihar, a vampiric ferryman will appear at Icewater Jetty, ready to take you to Solitude, Windhelm, or Dawnstar -- for the usual fee.",
  "descriptionHtml": "DESCRIPTION:\r<br />\r<br />After choosing to accept Harkon&#39;s gift during &#34;Awakening,&#34; you will find a new ferryman and his boat at Icewater Jetty. Aside from being a vampire, he&#39;s otherwise identical to the normal ferrymen and can take you to the same locations (minus Icewater Jetty, obviously) for the same fee.\r<br />\r<br />Being a vampire, he doesn&#39;t care if you transform into a vampire lord right in front of him.\r<br />\r<br />REQUIREMENTS:\r<br />\r<br />A working copy of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and its expansion, Dawnguard.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />\r<br />Place the contents of the .7z file in your &#34;Data&#34; folder, which is usually located under Steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />The ReadMe document and the .bsl file are not required for the mod to run -- you may keep them or discard them.\r<br />\r<br />UNINSTALLATION:\r<br />\r<br />Delete the included .esp and .bsa file.\r<br />\r<br />The nature of Skyrimâ€™s scripting language, Papyrus, means that, even following this procedure, your Papyrus log will continue to throw errors about missing scripts, potentially leading to save game bloat. There is, lamentably, nothing that I can do about this -- you have been warned.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATING:\r<br />\r<br />Replace all older files with newer versions. If in doubt, replace all mod files with the contents of the latest uploaded archive.\r<br />\r<br />No in-game configuration is necessary.\r<br />\r<br />BUGS:\r<br />\r<br />As of yet, none.\r<br />\r<br />COMPATIBILITY:\r<br />\r<br />This should be compatible with practically any mod.",
