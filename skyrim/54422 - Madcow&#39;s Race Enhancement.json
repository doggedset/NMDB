  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=Green][size=7]Madcow&#39;s Race Overhaul[/size][/color][/center][center][color=Green][size=4]by Madcow and lofgren[/size][/color][/center] \r<br />[color=Green][size=3]Version             :[/size][/color]1.3\r<br />[color=Green][size=3]Date                :[/size][/color]5/28/2014\r<br />[color=Green][size=3]Category            :[/size][/color]Gameplay Effects and Changes\r<br />\r<br />[u][center][size=5][color=Green]Description[/color][/size][/center][/u] \r<br />Ever wondered why Khajiit always talk about Skyrim being so cold, but still are able to move around as if it&#39;s their home? Or how Nords don&#39;t really seem to have any advantage in fighting in their homeland? Well now that&#39;s gonna change.\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds additional racial abilities so that - wait for it -  weather, spells, and faction relationships now affect health, stamina, and magicka. So for instance, if you attack a Dunmer with Fire spells, you will ACTUALLY HEAL him. Same goes for Nords; attack them with Frost spells and you will HEAL him. Imperials get a bonus for joining the legion, Khajiits need to stay on warmer sands, Argonians are stronger in the rain, and so on.\r<br />\r<br />I tried to make it as lore-, biology- and history friendly as possible. If you feel anything is OP, UP, or needs to be changed to a more lore friendly version, I am always open to suggestions. All healing rates apply to during combat as well.\r<br />\r<br />The aim is to create a more in depth range of strengths and weaknesses so that it&#39;s almost better to have a counter for each race you encounter \r<br />\r<br />[u][center][size=5][color=Green]Detail[/color][/size][/center][/u] \r<br />Redguard - \r<br />Freezing Feet - Stamina Regen 10%/20% slower when it is raining/snowing \r<br />Desert People - stamina regen +10% when clear weather\r<br />Desert Men - fire resistance 30%, frost resistance 15%\r<br />\r<br />Nord\r<br />Fire vs Ice - 10% Weaker against Fire\r<br />Winter Warrior - 25% faster heal rate when snowing\r<br />Snowman in Ice - Stamina regen 10% slower when it&#39;s clear weather\r<br />Winter Warrior 2 - frost attacks heal you 25hp per hit\r<br />Disdain for Magic - 20 less starting magicka\r<br />Night of Tears - +10 damage when fighting elves\r<br />\r<br />Khajiit\r<br />Bathing in the Sun - 25% faster heal rate when clear weather\r<br />Cat in the Water - Stamina regen 25% slower when raining\r<br />Brittle Whiskers - Health damaged 1hp/s when snowing\r<br />Night Hunters - +10 damage between 8PM and 6AM, +20 Health and Stamina when full moon\r<br />\r<br />Dunmer\r<br />Fire Healing - Attack by fire damage heals 25hp per hit by Firespell. \r<br />Fire vs Ice - 10% weaker against Frost\r<br />Don&#39;t Get Wet - Stamina Regen 10%/20% slower when it is raining/snowing\r<br />\r<br />Imperial\r<br />Vini Vidi Vici - 25% faster health regen if player joins the Legion\r<br />Roma Invicta - +25 armor rating if player joins the legion\r<br />Intelligent and Shrewd - +10 to Speechcraft (Not base value, fortify enchantment)\r<br />Remarkable Light Infantry - Light Armor skill fortified by 10 points when wearing 2 or more light armor (100% Lore friendly.

I double checked to make sure all of them appear in the HUD but please let me know if you only don&#39;t see any of the ones mentioned. \r<br />\r<br />Q. Does this work with existing saves?\r<br />A. No. Try it out on your next new playthrough unless you want to risk that level 80 character you have. Regardless of whether it actually might or not work, I will insist on the same principles of my mod testing: Never install or remove a mod mid gameplay ,or skyrim sorcery will get to you. But upgrading should be fine.\r<br />\r<br />[u][center][size=5][color=Green]Incompatibilities[/color][/size][/center][/u] \r<br />Load it after ACE\r<br />If you are using SkyRe, do not load the race modules and load this after SkyRe. \r<br />\r<br />[u][center][size=5][color=Green]Credits[/color][/size][/center][/u] \r<br />Major thanks to lofgren for creating the essential spell effect of healing when under fire.
