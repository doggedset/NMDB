  "summary": "A mod which adds forgable and upgradable Blades Armor, as well as a standalone Light Armor Variety.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod, so please go easy on me.\r\n\r\nA mod which offers the following improvements to the Blades Armor:\r\nA Light Armor Version (Standalone, does not replace the pre-existing Heavy version)\r\nThe ability to Forge your own Blades Armor, either Light or Heavy (Requires Advanced Armors Blacksmithing Perk and the completion of the Alduin\\'s Wall quest)\r\nThe ability to upgrade your Blades Armor at the workbench\r\n\r\nYou\\'ll find the options to craft them in the Misc Section.\r\n\r\nSteam Workshop Version: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=100121136\r\n\r\nA Special thanks goes out to all the people at Nexusmods who put up with my innane questions in the Chatroom and who helped me get this, my first mod, rolling. You know who you are!\r\n\r\nTo do list for future versions:\r\nGet the options to craft them in their own \\\"Blades\\\" category.\r\nMake the Light Armor Version More Distinct and, well, Lighter. However, I really wouldn\\'t know what to do and would probably end up screwing this up royally. If you are a capable modeller and wouldn\\'t mind helping me, that would be awesome and I would strive to repay you in some manner. If interested, please let me know.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.1: Moved the armor to the Steel section of the Smithing UI.\r\n1.2: Made the sword forgable, and increased the armor on both versions and all pieces.\r\n\r\nNote: If you wish to include this mod in some pack or something, please just ask and I\\'ll probably say yes.",
