  "summary": "Adds a fairly large player home attached to Breezehome. Includes a small attached dungeon.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Breezehome is -boring-. So boring that I regret paying for it on a daily basis. Hence, Hall Under Breezehome. The Alchemy Lab area in Breezehome now has a trapdoor in the middle (upgrade not required) that leads down into a Spacious Passageway; this passageway is in itself a small dungeon, containing several bits of loot in the form of chests and satchels, guarded by mobs including a daedra, a dwarven centurion, and a &#39;plain&#39; dragon priest, among other, weaker mobs. The safe path is to the left of the entry alcove and then straight ahead, if you are lower-level or simply aren&#39;t interested in fighting. \r<br />\r<br />Exiting the passageway, you enter Hall Under Breezehome, a home worth the trouble of gathering all that gold early on. It comes fully furnished with an armory/forge room and magic room; the latter is hidden in a cabinet, so as not to offend guests with possible tortured groans or alchemical odors, and contains three semi-rare and helpful magic tomes on pedestals. The other rooms consist of a kitchen, a common room, two bedrooms, servant&#39;s quarters (for a future incarnation; NPCs are incomplete), and lobby.\r<br />\r<br />1.1 is an optional alternative that adds two scenic NPCs and one marriageable follower, all argonian. I strongly recommend the (Almost) Everyone is an Adventurer mod for the scenic NPCs; it outfits them in an armor according to your class choice and gives them extra use. \r<br />\r<br />This mod is my first and a work in progress. If anyone happens upon it, please share your thoughts and ideas. ",
