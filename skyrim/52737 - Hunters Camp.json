  "descriptionHtml": "-CONSULT USER IMAGES (NAMELY THOSE OF BAGGYBILL); THEY&#39;RE BETTER QUALITY THAN MY OWN-\r<br />\r<br />Cozy, lore-friendly  (with new, written lore to explain things) fortified camp tucked away in the forest, but near to major and minor roads. Unlike most home mods, this isn&#39;t magically granted to you or conveniently vacant. It was always yours. Within the camp is a journal written by the player, explaining that the camp is yours, why it is mostly void of supplies, etc. The home includes most of the usual amenities, however;\r<br />-Anvil\r<br />-Workbench\r<br />-Grindstone\r<br />-Cooking Pot\r<br />-Alchemy Table\r<br />-Food Allotment\r<br />-Poison Garden\r<br />-Storage\r<br />-Display Facilities (Excluding mannequins)\r<br />-Shelter and a fire, for mods such as Frostfall\r<br />-Bedroll\r<br />-Wood Chopping Block\r<br />-Archery Range\r<br />-And more&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Also around the camp are new creature spawns for the budding hunter in all of us (especially good for Hunterborn, RNaD, Frostfall, Requiem/SkyRe, etc... There are some bandits within walking distance of the camp, but not close enough to spot you unless you go looking for them. Vigilants and other wanderers do occasionally pass by, so you won&#39;t be alone, but you will be secluded and isolated for the majority of the time. \r<br />\r<br />With mines, caves, hunting quarry, bandits and wanderers within reasonable distance, you can also make a pretty penny based out of the camp. Riften isn&#39;t too far away, either.\r<br />\r<br />I know this mod will only appeal to a pretty niche market, but even if you&#39;re not a hunter and you just want a home away from the cities or you enjoy living under the stars or in the wild, this home is worth a look.\r<br />\r<br />If you enjoy the home, please endorse and/or comment. Any issues or bugs, please comment and I&#39;ll see to them ASAP. Enjoy your new home, everyone&#33;\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION\r<br />-NMM compatible, use that if you like. Place anywhere below Skyrim.esm and Update.esm.\r<br />-To install manually, just extract the file to your data folder.\r<br />-This mod is not incompatible with any mod I am aware of. Please alert me of any conflicts.\r<br />-Feedback on what you think&#33;\r<br />-IF UPGRADING TO V2.0, REMOVE YOUR STUFF FROM THE CAMP, UNINSTALL THE OLD FILES, THEN INSTALL THE NEW VERSION.\r<br />\r<br />UNINSTALLATION\r<br />-Remove using NMM.\r<br />-To remove manually, just delete the file from the data folder.\r<br />\r<br />",
