If that sounds like you then this player home is most certainly for you&#33; Downreach Hall is a majestic player home, museum & storage area. The mod is split into six different areas:\r<br />\r<br />1) Private Display Museum\r<br />2) Storage Room\r<br />3) Merchant Shop\r<br />4) Laboratory\r<br />5) Library Room\r<br />6) Bedrooms\r<br />\r<br />Before we go into any great detail, here is a list of the key features of Downreach:\r<br />\r<br />[u]Display Museum:[/u]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#0000ff][size=3]+[/size][/color] A private collectors museum with mannequins where you can display thirty-two sets of your favorite armor.

Containers used are chests, strongboxes & safes\r<br />[color=#0000ff][size=3]+[/size][/color] A fully manned guard station, to protect all your precious goods\r<br />[color=#0000ff][size=3]+[/size][/color] Shrines to Nocturnal & The Nine Divines\r<br />\r<br />[u]Merchant Shop:[/u]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#0000ff][size=3]+[/size][/color] An on-site merchant with a 5000 gold limit\r<br />[color=#0000ff][size=3]+[/size][/color] leveled weapon & Armor goods for sale \r<br />\r<br />[u]Laboratory:[/u]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#0000ff][size=3]+[/size][/color] A room for the crafting enthusiast.

There are separate bookcases        for notes, journals, recipe & spell tomes\r<br />[color=#0000ff][size=3]+[/size][/color] Six display cases for your favorite books\r<br />[color=#0000ff][size=3]+[/size][/color] Two separate chests to store Mod Manual Books and Property Deeds\r<br />\r<br />[u]Bedrooms:\r<br />[/u]\r<br />[color=#0000ff][size=3]+[/size][/color] Seven bedrooms for your character and followers\r<br />[color=#0000ff][size=3]+[/size][/color] A master suite for your character\r<br />\r<br />As of version 2.7 there is a small quest which will add abit of background about the origin of Downreach. The quest starts at the start of a new game with a courier delivering a note.\r<br />\r<br />Downreach Hall has two different entrances. The main entrance is located North-East on Whiterun&#39;s outer wall, the entrance is guarded by two \r<br />npc&#39;s in full armor. There is also a secret trap door located in the sewer entrance on the immediate right upon entering Whiterun. You can find \r<br />these locations on the images section on the mods nexus page.\r<br />\r<br />The mod was originally created by carbonus8910. I asked him permission to take the mod over which he agreed to as he was working on other\r<br />projects. I tried to make several significant improvements to Downreach Hall without destroying its original vibe. Some original material was \r<br />changed while some completely new features were added. I have logged the main improvements:\r<br />\r<br />[color=#0000ff]***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************[/color]\r<br />[color=#f4f4f4]Display Museum[/color][color=#0000ff]*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************[/color]\r<br />1) The dragon Priest mask holder was not working due to scripting issues. Deleted the old one and added a new one with a different design. All \r<br />     scripts are now fixed\r<br />2) The dragon claw holder was likewise not working due to the scripts not being present in the original. Deleted it and introduced a new design \r<br />     with working scripts\r<br />\r<br />Along the same wall as the dragon Priest mask and claw holders I added:\r<br />\r<br />+ A Black Book holder for all seven books (hence the mod now requiring Dragonborn DLC)\r<br />+ An Elder Scroll holder for all three scrolls (hence the mod now requiring Dawnguard DLC)\r<br />+ A bug jar holder for all five individual jars\r<br />+ A Deadric Prince weapon holder including a special holder for Spellbreaker above it\r<br />\r<br />In the middle of the hall near the extra large mannequin I have added a stand for all the Daedric prince Armor and ring rewards. This stand also has activators for Mehrunes Razor, Azura&#39;s Star and the Black Star.\r<br />\r<br />Podiums have been added to the mannequins along the side wall as well as the mannequin stands on podiums along the back wall. Finally the extra large mannequin has been moved over to make room for one more.\r<br />\r<br />Version 2.8 added a lot of new features into this room.Carpets were added along all the side walls and a fully manned guard station was built near the main entrance. A new holder for the Dawnguard Paragons was added along the main wall with the dragon claw holder. Because of this the secret trap door was moved into the Storage Room. \r<br />\r<br />You will also find the Daedric reward table has been moved to make way for a brand new treasure display area found in the center of the room.Here you will find three tables to display the items of your choosing. There are also new pre-set activators for:\r<br />\r<br />[list][*][size=2]Axe & Shield of Ysgramor                             \r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Crown of Barenziah & Bust\r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]All Thieves Guild Treasures                          \r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Divine Amulets wall mount[/size][/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[size=2]Version 2.9 introduced some additions to this room.\r<br />\r<br />Displays have been added for:\r<br />\r<br />[list][*]Dragonstone\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]Dragon Burial Map\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]Horn of Jurgen Windcaller\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]Arch-Mage Robes\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]Arch-Mage Boots\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]Savos Aren&#39;s Amulet\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[/list][/size][size=2]\r<br />Along the main display wall there has also been one addition:\r<br />\r<br />[list][*]Oghma Infinium\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />A hold guard uniform display for the nine cities has been added opposite the treasure display wall.\r<br />\r<br />(Check screen shots for the new displays)[/size][color=#0000ff]***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************[/color]\r<br />[color=#f4f4f4]Teleport Stones[/color][color=#0000ff]*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************[/color]\r<br />Upon downloading the original I noticed that the scripts for the original teleporter were deleted locally and would not work. With this in mind I deleted the original and in its place created nine new teleport stones that will teleport the player to the nine different holds in Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#0000ff]***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************[/color]\r<br />[color=#f4f4f4]Merchant[/color][color=#0000ff]************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />[/color]The original merchant was a Nord dressed in the Sheogorath outfit. My characters are nearly always Khajiit&#39;s so I made him into one (they are much better traders anyway&#33;) You will find him in his original position wearing a classic merchants outfit. Two special books have been added to the merchants inventory, they are named:\r<br />\r<br />1) Portal to Downreach Hall: Spell\r<br />2) Portal to Downreach Hall: Lesser Power\r<br />\r<br />These two tomes have a base value of 200 Septims. These will teach your character a spell/lesser power that will teleport you back to Downreach Hall from any location. A lesser power option was necessary as I realize that some people&#39;s characters do not use magic at all.\r<br />\r<br />The spell is in the novice alteration category, it takes 1.5 seconds to cast at the cost of 12 magicka (this can vary race to race). The lesser power version costs 12 magicka with no charge time and can be used an unlimited amount of times per day.\r<br />\r<br />As of version 2.5 the merchant has been moved into a custom built shop found attached to the storeroom\r<br />\r<br />[color=#0000ff]***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************[/color]\r<br />[color=#f4f4f4]Mannequin Wardrobe Rooms[/color][color=#0000ff]**************************************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />[/color]In Version 2.2 I introduced two very large Mannequin & Weapon storage rooms. In version 2.3 I have added two extra rooms on the opposite side. They are all completely nav-meshed for followers.\r<br />\r<br />They are located in the main hall and are named &#39;Wardrobe Room I, II, III, IV&#39; Each room contains:\r<br />\r<br />48 Normal Sized Mannequins \r<br />8 Mannequins on pedestals \r<br />\r<br />So all in all that&#39;s 224 Mannequins. Check the images section for screenshots.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#0000ff]***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************[/color]\r<br />[color=#f4f4f4]Storage Room[/color][color=#0000ff]*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************[/color]\r<br />During my own play-through I realized that the containers were not all categorized correctly for my own needs, so some alterations were made. By the end of the changes every category of item was covered for containment. It would be too lengthy to state every container in this room but every category of item you can think of has an appropriate container. Some containers were moved to allow others to be added. The new containers added in this room are as follows:\r<br />\r<br />Strongboxes:\r<br />\r<br />Earrings\r<br />Savings (a place to store Septims)\r<br />\r<br />Chests:\r<br />\r<br />Capes, Cloaks & Hoods (for the popular cloak mods)\r<br />Mage Robes and Hoods\r<br />Enchanted Armor\r<br />Enchanted Weapons\r<br />Mod Armor\r<br />Mod Weapons\r<br />\r<br />Safes:\r<br />\r<br />Food\r<br />Hearthfire Baking Ingredients\r<br />Soul Gems\r<br />Keys - Player Home & Properties\r<br />Keys - Misc Locations\r<br />\r<br />The &#39;Valuable Items&#39; container was changed to &#39;Dragon Bones&#39;.\r<br />\r<br />Version 2.5 revamped this room entirely. New containers have been added to the list above. Also added to this room was a fully manned guard station&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=#0000ff]***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************[/color]\r<br />[color=#f4f4f4]Library[/color][color=#0000ff]***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************[/color]\r<br />+ All singular book cases ran from the letter A through to Z, including a journal, note, recipe and spell tome case. I added a number 0-9 bookcase \r<br />   considering there are quite a few books with numbers as titles.\r<br />+ I also added reading tables going along the center of the room to make it resemble more of a &#39;library&#39;, clutter was also added to the tables.\r<br />+ Also added to this room were two extra chests labelled &#39;Property Deeds&#39; and &#39;Mod Manual&#39; chests.\r<br />+ Six display cases for rare books were added along with a writing desk.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#0000ff]***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************[/color]\r<br />[color=#f4f4f4]Laboratory[/color][color=#0000ff]**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************[/color]\r<br />Version 2.5 introduced a new laboratory with the hard-core crafter in mind. Found in this room is a cook-pot, forge, smelter, tanning rack, \r<br />grindstone, workbench & wood chopper. A lot of this was fairly cramped in the storage room so I created an entirely new room for it all. The room \r<br />can be found behind a secret wardrobe entrance next to the guard station in the storage room.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#0000ff]***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************[/color]\r<br />[color=#f4f4f4]Bedrooms[/color][color=#0000ff]************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r<br />***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************[/color]\r<br />I had received a few requests for separate bedrooms for the player and followers, so it was introduced in Version 2.5. In this room you will find \r<br />seven separate bedrooms. You can find the entrance in the same corridor as the merchant shop.\r<br />\r<br />Version 2.6 introduced a master bedroom suite. Just activate the central sigil stone in this room to access the new room. You will find a personal mannequin in this here along with a personal storage chest and another teleporter to return you to the previous room.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]MOD REQUIREMENTS[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Special display holders for the three Elder Scrolls and the seven Black Books have been added. Therefore, the mod now requires the following add-on&#39;s:\r<br />\r<br />1) Dawngaurd DLC\r<br />2) Dragonborn DLC\r<br />\r<br />You have my apologies if you do not own these. I dislike mods that require you to own specific DLC&#39;s to function but in this case it can not be avoided.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]RECOMMENDED MODS[/size] [/color]\r<br />\r<br />This mod contains a large number of mannequins. There are anumber of bugs in the game that can cause the mannequins to &#39;roam&#39; around. There is a simple fix for this, download from Skyrim Nexus:\r<br />\r<br />Vanilla Mannequin Script Fix - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10652/?\r<br />\r<br />I would also recommend you use any mod that allows you placeand move items easily in the game. My personal recommendation found on Skyrim Nexus:\r<br />\r<br />Jaxonz Positioner - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52583/?\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]INSTALLING THE MOD [/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />1.) Drag and drop the chosen file into the data section of your Skyrim folder and make sure the esp is activated.  \r<br />2.) Install using Nexus Mod Manager (NMM) or Mod Organizer (MO).     \r<br />\r<br />I would highly recommend the second option for beginners unless you know what you are doing.  \r<br />\r<br />**NOTE** The archive contains the scripts used in the mod, they are needed for the various holder and teleport stones to function\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]UPGRADING VERSION [/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]If you are upgrading from a previous version, like most authors, I would recommend making a ‘clean save’. Please follow these steps:\r<br />\r<br />[/size][list=1][*][size=2]Empty Downreach Hall of all the equipment you donot want to loose and store elsewhere temporarily\r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Release all of your followers, go into aninterior cell with no NPC’s and make a new save game\r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Download the latest version of Downreach Reborn(making sure you download the correct version)\r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Using a mod manager or manually, uninstall allfiles that are found in the original archive\r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Reinstall the latest version either manually orusing the preferred mod organiser\r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]After installation please remember to run LOOTagain and re-run any overhaul reproccers for mods such as Skyrim Redone. Also remember to rebuild your ‘Bashed Patch’. This is not always necessary but most consider it a good modding practice\r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Move the stored equipment back into DownreachHall[/size]\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]UNINSTALLATION  [/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]Because of the nature of papyrus scripts there is no way to completely remove the scripts from your save game. Where scripts are concerned; \r<br />adding is fine, removing them is not recommended. Try to test all mods with a clean save to test for incompatibilities before you proceed with playing. \r<br />\r<br />That being said, if you still wish to uninstall please follow the following instructions, either:\r<br />\r<br />[/size][list=1][*][size=2]Delete the esp and scripts found in the data section of the Skyrim program files. Consult the original archive for a list of files to delete.\r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]Uninstall through the Nexus Mod Manager (NMM) or Mod Organizer\r<br />[/size][/*]\r<br />[/list][size=2]\r<br />After deletion I would recommend you use a very clever tool designed by Hadoram:\r<br />\r<br />Save Game Script Cleaner - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52363/?\r<br />\r<br />This tool will remove all left over orphan scripts in the game, that is, scripts that are no longer needed or in use in the current setup. Like anything \r<br />mod related, it will not guarantee that your save will not be damaged but it will work 99.9% of the time\r<br />\r<br />NOTE - PLEASE REMEMBER TO REMOVE ANYTHING YOU HAVE STORED IN DOWNREACH HALL BEFORE DELETION&#33;[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER MODS [/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />+ Downreach is fully compatible with Open Cities, if you use it please download the relevant file\r<br />\r<br />+ The Open Cities file is now fully compatible with JK&#39;s Whiterun mod. The secret trap door was covered by alterations made by JK. The trapdoor \r<br />   has been moved slightly to compensate for this\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]KNOWN CONFLICTS & MINOR ISSUES[/size][/color] \r<br />\r<br />None have been reported so far, but if you notice anything please let me know politely as soon as possible and I will fix it.\r<br />\r<br />The only thing that is worth mentioning here is that upon teleportation, the game does not auto-save. So please just be aware of that.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]COPYRIGHT[/size][/color] \r<br />\r<br />If other authors would like to use Downreach or any aspect of it in their work please feel free to contact me. Otherwise please don&#39;t upload this mod to other sites or re-upload it here without permission.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]PLANS FOR THE MOD GOING FORWARD[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />I have already started improvements which will be coming during the next few months, these include:\r<br />\r<br />[u]Completed:[/u]\r<br /> \r<br />+ An attached wardrobe room with 100-200 more mannequins for the hard-core collector (like myself)\r<br />+ An &#39;Open Cities&#39; compatibility version, this will involve moving the trap door to just outside whiterun&#39;s main gate \r<br />+ A merchant shop attached to Downreach\r<br />+ Bedrooms attached to Downreach\r<br />+ A secret crafting laboratory attached to Downreach \r<br />+ A guard station in the storage room\r<br />+ A quest to gain Downreach and provide some immersion\r<br />\r<br />[u]In Progress:[/u]\r<br />\r<br />+ An auto-sorter for all the storable items in the game **It may take some time as I have never made one before; it takes a heck of a lot of scripting&#33;**\r<br />+ An auto-strip activator near the pool for the player and Followers\r<br />[u]\r<br />Low Priority:[/u]\r<br />\r<br />+ A complete redesign of the entrance to Downreach Hall\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]CREDITS[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Downreach Original Creator - carbonus8910\r<br />Various Display Holders and Scripts (modders resource) - skyrimlazz\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4]MY OTHER MODS\r<br />[/size][/color]\r<br />If you liked the custom teleport spells found in the game you may like my other mod:\r<br />\r<br />Player Home Portals - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61392/?\r<br />\r<br /> This mod will add either spells or lesser powers which will teleport the player to nearly every home location in the entire game and DLC&#39;s\r<br />\r<br />Did you like the custom displays found in the mod?
