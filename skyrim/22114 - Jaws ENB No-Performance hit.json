  "descriptionHtml": "I have a 6670 card. It\\'s not the fastest, but runs most things just fine. Along with vanilla Skyrim. However, once you start adding effects from ENB configs, it slows down a lot. \r\n\r\nThis is one I have modified myself. It does not include Depth of Field or any other fancy settings, which means it\\'s fully compatible with IMAGINATOR and DYNAVISION. It also keeps fire and lights orange tinted, not grey/white. I recommend using the above mods to adjust contrast and saturation to your liking.\r\n\r\nMy performance hit is 1-5 fps depending on area. \r\n\r\nThanks to all the people putting out guides, so people like me can attempt to do something on their own. :D\r\n\r\n",
