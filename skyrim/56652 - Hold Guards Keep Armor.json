  "summary": "Guards will continue to use the armor for their respective Hold, regardless of what side controls it.",
  "descriptionHtml": "After a Hold is taken in the vanilla game, the original guards are replaced by ones that wore Legion or Stormcloak armor.  Since I wanted the new guards to also use the guard armor for their respective Holds, I went into the Creation Kit and changed that.  After I finished, I decided to upload it here in case anyone else felt the way I do.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/images/110/2463779-1407310314.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />With this installed, after a Hold switches sides, you will now see Imperial or Stormcloak Guards (depending on the side you chose) who will still have the Hold armor and shields.\r<br />\r<br />Please note that the only testing I&#39;ve done is in playing through normally, and I have only used this while fighting for the Stormcloaks.  All guards are supposed to use Hold Guard armor, so if you see any that aren&#39;t, please let me know where you saw them so I can fix them.  However, please confirm that it isn&#39;t a soldier who is meant to be using that armor (no guards should look like soldiers with this mod installed).\r<br />\r<br />- Thanks to jayr848 for adding a link to this on one of his mod pages.\r<br />\r<br />[u][size=3]Suggested Mods:\r<br />[/size][/u][list][*][size=2][u][/u][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54212/?][u]Extra Guards[/u] by jayr848[/url]: As the name suggests, this adds many more guards across Skyrim, including in places that don&#39;t have guards at all.  I recommend installing this one only after the Civil War is over.  When I tried this, I kept getting bounties since the new guards literally stand in the middle of the battlefield, and I kept hitting them by accident.  If you use this mod, I also recommend installing the Extra Guards Patch, which you can find in the Files tab.[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2][u][/u][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25868/?][u]Stormcloaks with Sleeves[/u] by frank zunge:[/url] Gives Stormcloak Armor and all Hold Guard armors sleeves.[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2][u][/u][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/43493/?][u]Hold Border Banners[/u] by Thicketford:[/url] Adds banners on roads when they cross the border between Holds.[/size][/*]\r<br />[/list]",
