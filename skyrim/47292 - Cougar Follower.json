  "descriptionHtml": "This is my second mod.  It's a sexy cougar follower that will give you gifts, and fight with you.  I used the Lisette the Bard's model and gave her some sexy Forsworn armor with some badass enchants on.  She has a purple wisp arua around her because of the enchanted ring.  Give it a try and let me know.\r\nSide note she is marriable, and you have to have Dawnguard to use her.  Sorry forgot to add she's in the (sleeping giant inn) Riverwood",
