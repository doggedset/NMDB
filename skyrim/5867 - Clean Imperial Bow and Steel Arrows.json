  "descriptionHtml": "Hey everyone, \r\n\r\nThis is my first submission so I\\'ll be going right back into more modding in case I don\\'t respond right away. \r\n\r\nI didn\\'t like how the texture was on the awesome looking imperial bow so I though I could improve on it with the help of kevinwastaken version of the imperial bow. It has more of a natural wood look and I attempted to apply the hunting bow style tips on the ends. \r\n\r\nComments and suggestions are appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks, ",
