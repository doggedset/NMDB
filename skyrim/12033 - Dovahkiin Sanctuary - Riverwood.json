  "descriptionHtml": "You have inherited Dovahkiin Sanctuary in beautiful Riverwood. \r\n\r\nThis is a unique custom house containing all the ammenites a Dragonborn could ask for. Compact, 3-level design makes everything easily accessible.\r\n\r\nThe house comes complete with 2 Dovahkiin Guards (followers) - Nina, specializing in one-handed sword and archery and Jorgen, a Spellsword who is not bad with a bow either.\r\n\r\nSmithing, Enchanting and Alchemy equipment are included. \r\n\r\nIn addition, there is a large armory with Mannequins, shield and weapon racks, a seperate library, a room for the Guards and of course ample storage throughout.\r\n\r\n[u]IMPORTANT[/u]: This mod utilizes an esm (master) file in addition to the normal esp (plugin).
