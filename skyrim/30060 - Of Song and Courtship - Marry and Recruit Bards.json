  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://oi45.tinypic.com/jabdz4.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nThis is a simple mod I threw together in about 1.5-2 hours. I realize there are many more \\\"marry everyone\\\" mods out there, but I mostly dothis for practice. Check the To-Do list for more updates.\r\n\r\nOf Song and Courtship 1.0 allows the player to marry every bard in skyrim, including many of the students at the Solitude College. Remember to wear an amulet of Mara! Now also allows the player to recruit all bards EXCEPT the ones in college. Stay in school kids.\r\n\r\nFor mod-makers: This mod simply changes/adds the factions and relationships to PotentialMarriage and Lover status.\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i50.tinypic.com/2hnb1x2.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\nNMM Installation: Simply \\\"Download With Manager\\\" and install the mod.\r\n\r\nManual Installation:\r\n1. Download the RAR file\r\n2. Exctract the contents/file into your Skyrim Data folder\r\n3. Check that the mod is being loaded in the Skyrim Launcher\r\n4. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i47.tinypic.com/1235l05.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n- Noticed that some Actors treat the player as friend before marriage. Might alter the relationship status through papyrus instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n- [s]Allow player to hire all Bards as companions  (Currently being worked on! Keep an eye out for  version 1)[/s]\r\n    - [s]Make compatible with UFO[/s]\r\n    - [s]Make sure the bards are balanced[/s] (LoL, balance in a single player game.)\r\n    - How will balanced bards cope with mods like SkyRe? Assign a scientist and psychologist team to check on them after changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i46.tinypic.com/2r6eat1.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[code]\r\n-Version 1.0\r\nLaunched!\r\nNow with 80% more follower capability!\r\nThe other 20%? Don\\'t look at me like that.\r\n\\\"Responsibility as a mod maker\\\" my perfectly rounded behind.\r\nFIne, fine. I\\'ll run more tests. Mom.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Version 0.8-0.9\r\nSuccessfully implemented follower mechanics to all Bards. Changed my mind, and in order to show the kids the importance of staying in school, the college attending bards will not join you as followers. IMMERSION!\r\nMinor tweaks before full release most likely tonight or tomorrow (18th)\r\n\r\n\r\n-Version 0.7\r\nRearrange for efficiency, spend 30 minutes trying to figure out why it doesn\\'t work. Forgot to enable plugin. Cry.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Version 0.6\r\nScrapped hireling idea  \r\nAll bards \\\"simple followers\\\" - works  \r\nChecked UFO compatability - works  \r\nPoured coffee - Could have been better  \r\nChecked again - Works  \r\n\r\n\r\n-Version 0.5\r\n\\\"Beta Release\\\"  \r\nSven wouldn\\'t marry. Probably because he was courting this other woman. Had a chat with him, he should be more willing now.  \r\n\r\n\r\n-Version 0.1-0.4\r\nLet there be light - The core concept implemented  [/code]\r\n\r\nThanks for checking it out!",
