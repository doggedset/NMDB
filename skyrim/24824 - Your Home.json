  "descriptionHtml": "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \r<br />20 Jun 2015 \r<br />\r<br />I appologize to all who have had issues with my mod recently. I have not been able to work on or update it for some time (well over a year I think). I am currently in the military so it has not left me much time to work on this. Fortunately I will likely have time to work on this in the coming months. I appreciate all the support I&#39;ve gotten for this mod and can&#39;t wait to get back to it&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Respectfully, \r<br />Spookyu \r<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \r<br />\r<br />Update 3 Oct 2012: Another minor update but the mod&#39;s changed enough to warrant a new version number&#33; Change list bellow.\r<br />-Added (the MUCH requested) weapon racks for staffs next to fireplace\r<br />-Added 2 mannequins near fireplace\r<br />\r<br />Description:\r<br />Simply put, I couldn&#39;t find a house mod that satisfied me, I&#39;m a simple man that likes to organize and display his spoils of war.

Please leave me any kind of bug fixes in the comments below.\r<br />\r<br />Known Bugs:\r<br />-Mannequins like to wander and strike poses. They don’t move but a few feet and have always returned to their original location upon exiting the home and reentering. Any suggestions on this would be GREATLY appreciated, as comical as this is I can’t get them to stop.\r<br />-Dawngaurd weapons won’t mount to display racks or cases (armor works just fine on mannequins).",
