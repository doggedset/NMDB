Go use that instead.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Requested by zxx900811.\r<br />\r<br />It has come to my attention that the Fortify Restoration effect fortifies itself, basically becoming a Fortify Alchemy effect. This fixes that by simply changing all Fortify Restoration effects to belong to the Alteration rather than Restoration school. (Does it make sense? Only barely. But it does the job.)",
