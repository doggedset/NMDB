  "descriptionHtml": "this is my hack and slashed enb setup. its perfect for what i want for \r\nnow and i keep consistent 35 to 60 fps without using fxaa, just enb.on \r\na geforce 465 so yeah, BADASS. the pallet texture took a while to get \r\nright where i wanted it but im pretty happy with it. do with it what \r\nyou will. \r\n\r\n\r\nthanks to boris ddd remmy hd6 and others\r\n\r\nMsiafterburner solution provided by JJ8132\r\n\r\nok after some tweaking with msi afterburner i got it to work wit enb. For people wanting to keep msi afterburner running for their profiles you need to go to MSI On-Screen Display Server and change application detection to none and turn off onscreen display. With that i got the mod fully running and i havent noticed a performance hit at all yet. ",
