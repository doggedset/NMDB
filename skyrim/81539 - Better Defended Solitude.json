  "descriptionHtml": "I made this mod after a video i saw from Shadiversity on the defence of Solitude, it is not a big mod, it just adds some gates to seperate the barracks area from the other baileys. I also fixed the problem with the wall that was too high to function as a battlement.\r<br />\r<br />The video by Shad:\r<br />[youtube]uMLfn9lNEp4[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />This mod does not make big changes but it is a nice addition if you want some immersion.",
