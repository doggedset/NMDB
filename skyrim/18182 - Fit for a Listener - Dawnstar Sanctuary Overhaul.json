  "summary": "A smallish mod to restore a sense of power to the lair of the Dark Brotherhood.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is an overhaul of the Dawnstar Sanctuary with one specific goal: To make it fit for a listener. I felt that the vanilla Sanctuary was a bit too dank and dirty for my taste. The greatest assassins in all of Tamriel should lurk in the shadows, not in the cobwebs. I created this mod to make the Sanctuary resemble the former glory that the Brotherhood boasted in it\\'s hay-day. Making it more symmetrical, regal, uniform, and intimidating, while still maintaining the rough-and-tumble Skyrim feel. Below are a list of features:\r\n\r\n-Blacksmithing necessities\r\n-Enchanting table\r\n-New, whole banners\r\n-Redesigned dining room\r\n-Lighting re-balances\r\n-Reopened crypts\r\n-Redesigned bedroom\r\n-Room for more recruits\r\n-Swept-up cobwebs\r\n\r\nThese are all in addition to general changes to make the sanctuary feel more imposing and impressive.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Notes*\r\nI STRONGLY recommend installing this AFTER acquiring the sanctuary and possibly after receiving all upgrades, as I have not tested how these scenarios work with the mod.\r\nI expect there to be a few bugs along the way, and I\\'ll keep as up-to-date on fixes as I can.\r\n\r\nA word to the wise: Some doors are best left locked, lest you find yourself on the wrong side of maternal instincts.",
