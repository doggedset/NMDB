I originally tried creating this mod from papyrus but found that the papyrus scripting was way too slow to handle the hud targeting. So I had to create a SKSE plugin to accomplish my goals, so thanks a lot SKSE team&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Note:\r<br />The papyrus scripting is very light.  Most of the code implementation is in the SKSE plugin and the SWF HUD file that is included with this mod.  The papyrus scripting is only used for hotkey events and for passing parameters to the widgets.  There are no OnUpdate events.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=gray][size=4][i][b]Requirements[/b][/i][/size][/color]\r<br />1. This Mod Requires SKSE Version 1.6.16 or Greater found [url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]here[/url].\r<br />2. This Mod Requires SkyUI Version 4.1 or Greater found [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863/?]here[/url] (for MCM only).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=gray][size=4][i][b]Installation[/b][/i][/size][/color]\r<br />It is recommended that you download and install with Nexus Mod Manager.  \r<br />\r<br />If you want to install manually, install the following files to these locations:\r<br />[list=1]\r<br />[*]Install AHZmoreHUD.bsa and AHZmoreHUD.esp into the &#34;&lt;Skyrim Folder&gt;/Data&#34; folder\r<br />[*]Install The SKSE plugin AHZmoreHUDPlugin.dll into the &#34;&lt;Skyrim Folder&gt;/Data/SKSE/Plugins&#34; folder\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[color=gray][size=4][i][b]Removal[/b][/i][/size][/color]\r<br />To remove, go to the moreHUD MCM menu, and choose &#39;Uninstall&#39;  then exit the MCM menu.  Then save your game and remove the mod.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=gray][size=4][i][b]Compatibility[/b][/i][/size][/color]\r<br />1. Less Intrusive HUD is not able to position these widgets, but moreHUD gives the options to move the widgets in the MCM menu.\r<br />\r<br />This mod should be compatible with most everything else that does not modify the HUD since there are no leveled list and very few papyrus scripting, etc.  \r<br />I have even taken the extra time to be compatible with Harvest Overhaul found [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16553/?]here[/url].  \r<br />\r<br />If you do find any incompatibilities please let me know.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=gray][size=4][i][b]Known Issues[/b][/i][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />1. Sometimes the total armor rating does not match the vanilla&#39;s armor rating found in the inventory menu by 1.  I suspect there is a rounding issues with the vanilla&#39;s display value.  The value that this mod displays DOES equal to the total armor rating for all the equipped armor, so who knows.\r<br />\r<br />2. There appears to be a bug in the vanilla game that calculates bow damage as (bow damage + bolt damage) when there are bolts equipped (DG).  Obviously, this is not correct and this mod&#39;s calculation does not do that an therefore will not match the vanilla&#39;s\r<br />\r<br />3. Also, when targeting a bow, and the player has a crossbow equipped, the vanilla game calculates the weapon difference using the following formula (targeted bow damage + (equipped bolt damage (* 2?)) - (equipped crossbow damage + equipped bolt damage).  So this mod does not do that either\r<br />\r<br />4. The weight for unharvested ingredients is not displayed because I have not found a reliable way of predicting how many ingredients the flora or tree will yield when using leveled lists (Harvest Overhaul).  I may look into this later.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=gray][size=4][i][b]Thanks&#33;[/b][/i][/size][/color]\r<br />[list=1]\r<br />[*]The SKSE Team\r<br />[*]The SkyUI Team\r<br />[*]Those that help with finding bugs&#33;\r<br />[*]And of course, Bethesda&#33;\r<br />[/list]",
