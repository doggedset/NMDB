Simple!\n<br />\n<br />Here a little video: [youtube]AtMtLOtnDV0[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />This is an idea I had a while back that didn't end up being as funny as I thought it would be, but it's complete enough for release, so here it is!\n<br />\n<br />NOT compatible with any other blood replacer or remover.Â  Should be compatible with anything else, though. If confetti isn't showing up, try moving this to the end of your load order.\n<br />\n<br />This is NOT a complete blood removal - neck stumps are still red, some splatters, particularly werewolf and vampire attacks, may still be bloody.",
