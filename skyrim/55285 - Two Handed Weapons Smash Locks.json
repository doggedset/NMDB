  "descriptionHtml": "I hate video game doors. Like, &#34;Oh no, how will my missile launcher possibly overcome this insurmountable wooden thing? Earth is doomed&#33;&#34;\r<br />\r<br />This mod provides an actually meaningful difference between one-handed and two-handed weapons: One-handed has higher DPS, but two-handed now has a useful secondary function. \r<br />\r<br />Your weapon&#39;s worth determines what locks it can smash. Loosely:\r<br />\r<br />Iron -- Novice\r<br />Steel -- Apprentice\r<br />Dwarven -- Adept\r<br />Elven -- Expert\r<br />Ebony -- Master\r<br />\r<br />...but it&#39;s based on the gold value of your weapon, so Smithing can improve your chances. Weapons added by other mods should work too as long as they&#39;re categorized as Battleaxes or Warhammers. \r<br />\r<br />I didn&#39;t include Greatswords because that&#39;s another meaningless vanilla choice -- Greatswords have the highest DPS so why wouldn&#39;t you use them? Well, because swords can&#39;t smash things.\r<br />\r<br />Since it would break quests, locks that require a key can&#39;t be smashed (%#@&#33;). \r<br />\r<br />Note that smashing open a lock is really loud, and doing so will almost certainly attract attention. You might want to kill everything first.\r<br />\r<br />Also note that smashing a lock when there&#39;s a guard nearby will give you a bounty. Again, smashing locks is really loud -- guards will notice even if they&#39;re far away.\r<br />\r<br />Finally: Vanilla Skyrim offers a curious spell that mages might find especially useful now...\r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod. I wanted to do something simple but useful: Something small enough to let me learn how things work, but broad enough that I&#39;d actually use it in my own playthroughs. I also wanted to give back to everyone who&#39;s added so much to my favorite game. This is what I came up with; I hope you like it. :)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />--- VERSION HISTORY ---\r<br />\r<br />1.0 - Totally borked BSA file\r<br />\r<br />1.0a - Totally working .7z file\r<br />\r<br />1.1 - Fix so that followers who are classified as Guards (such as followers from Orc strongholds) won&#39;t give you a bounty.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]MY OTHER MODS[/size]\r<br />\r<br />* [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57721/?]Epic Restoration[/url] \r<br />[size=3]* [/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65433%08/?]Useful Alteration[/url]\r<br />* [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58543/?]Master Spells Should Be Masterful[/url]\r<br />* [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58547/?]One Click Inventory Sorting[/url] \r<br />* [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/55285/?]Two Handed Weapons Smash Locks[/url]",
