  "descriptionHtml": "I\\'ve been working on porting some Oblivion LOTR mods to Skyrim(I\\'ve successfully done Hadhafang and Anduril, waiting for permission from the original authors to release them), and while waiting for permission to release decided to try some originals. As it stands, these replace the Nightingale gloves -- the item they are a retexturing of. I simply do not know how to add new items to the game, so this is the best I can do, sorry fellows.\r\n\r\nThis is my first retexturing, so go easy.\r\n\r\nTo those who want a sword on their back -- try a two-handed sword. ;) I\\'m actually in the process of figuring out how to switch the placement for 1 and 2 handed weapons between the hip and the back, but I\\'ve become stuck at the last step. All animations play properly, and it\\'s held at his side/back as is appropriate...but the sword remains stationary there. Trying to sort it out. \r\n\r\nInstallation is easy, simply drop the extracted archive into the data folder.",
