  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a new set of robes and staff to the world of Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />The robes (unenchanted) can be crafted if you have Elven smithing at the forge under misc sectionÂ and supports both male and female.\r<br />\r<br />Also, you can find an enchanted version, plus staff on three npc&#39;s that are found near the Serpent Stone.\r<br />\r<br />Unfortunately, there is no beast support for the mask but I did include a hood that will work for them.\r<br />\r<br />The mask and shoulder pieces are part of Natterform&#39;s Ordinator armor and added to this mod with permission. It can be found here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26720/?\r<br />\r<br />Finally, due to this mod using assets from a mod that is a Nexus exclusive, this mod must remain a nexus exclusive release.\r<br />\r<br />Credits\r<br />\r<br />Bethesda for Skyrim\r<br />Natterforme for his awesome Ordinator armor\r<br />Blender 2.49b\r<br />NifSkope\r<br />PS CS6\r<br />\r<br />Thanx, Scroll Thief",
