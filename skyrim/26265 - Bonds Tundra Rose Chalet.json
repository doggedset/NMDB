  "descriptionHtml": "I have uploaded a new esp. Please download the main file and substitute this esp for the original. It corrects for a navmesh issue at the boat. Companions will now accompany you aboard the boat.\r\n\r\nThis mod is based on inspiration and assets from Nart2007 and his exterior home mod, \\\"Whiterun Outskirts Home\\\". It has all new textures and assets and in no way conflicts with the original, which I highly recommend as a download and addition to your game. You can find that fine home here:\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23827\r\n\r\nLOCATION:\r\n\r\nYou can fast travel to the house. It is located east of Half Moon Mill and North of Falkreath on the lake. It consists of a two story exterior home with clear windows on the world. In addition it is a working farm with some new chickens including roosters.\r\n \r\nA party ship waits at the dock for you, It has a full two level interior.\r\n\r\nThere is a two level basement. The first level is a display room and includes enchanting and alchemy benches. The lower level is a fancy dorm for your friends and companions.\r\nThere is a lot of storage and display available.\r\n \r\nThere are six mannequins.\r\n\r\nAll crafting is available.\r\n \r\nThis mod makes no pretense at being \\\"lore correct\\\". It\\'s for fun and pleasure. A place to relax in a rough neighborhood with your companions. The house and all levels, as well as the ship are fully navmeshed and companion friendly.\r\n\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\nAdditional Credits:\r\nClinster74 for weapon racks, alchemy bench, enchanting bench, and display cases. \r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\nNew Plants 1_1 by Tamira\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22018\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\nMighty Joe Young from 1mjytropicalcastle mod\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18215\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\nFood Container Resource by Blary http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14133\r\nBook sets Resource by Blary  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14135\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\nSpring Flowers for Skyrim by elinin  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/searchresults/?adv=1&\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\nModders Resource Pack by Oaristys   http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16525 \r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above are my own many new textures particularly for furniture, floors, walls, ceilings, rugs and vases. \r\n\r\nAll my assets are free use without further permission.
