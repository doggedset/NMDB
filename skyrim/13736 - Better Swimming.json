  "descriptionHtml": "SUMMARY:\r\nThis mod gives the player speed penalties for wearing clothing/armor when swimming. Heavy armor reduces swim speed more than light armor. \r\n\r\nSwim naked - it\\'s fastest. Excellent for roleplaying.\r\n\r\nI thought the default swim speeds were way too fast compared to real life.\r\n\r\nI called it Better Swimming instead of realistic swimming, because it\\'s not perfect. \r\n\r\nSpeed breakdown:\r\n\r\nWearing anything: -10%\r\nHeavy armor: -40% (any item)\r\nLight armor: -25% (any item) (doesn\\'t stack with heavy armor)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, your inventory weight compared to your carry weight will influence your swim speed as well, up to 40% slower (30% for Argonians) at max capacity.\r\n\r\nWearing heavy armor fully loaded = -80% swim speed\r\n\r\nArgonians (and anyone with the active waterbreathing effect) bypass the armor slow downs, so the slowest you could be while waterbreathing is -40% (-30% for Argonians).\r\n\r\nIf you drop all your stuff by the shore (or in the water) and go skinny dipping, you suffer no penalties.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeedback wanted.\r\n\r\nINSTALL:\r\nPut esp in Data folder\r\nPut pex files in Scripts folder (3)\r\nPSC files are included in Source folder (3)\r\n\r\nUNINSTALL:\r\nRemove above files\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\nNitor\r\n\r\nPERMISSIONS:\r\nPlease edit, redistribute, and make derivative works. I would appreciate credit. I\\'m sure someone out there can make swim speeds more realistic.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\nMy Other Mods\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6745]Hypothermia[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7417]Smithing Tomes[/url]",
