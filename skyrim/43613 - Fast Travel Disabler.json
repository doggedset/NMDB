  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i.imgur.com/g4bEpbm.jpg[/img]\n<br />[size=10][b]Description:[/b][/size]\n<br />This mod disables the fast travel option within the game. Even though you could simply abstain from doing it in game, this mod is targeted at those (and myself) who take comfort in the fact that they never had a choice. It is a small mod and was made due to the fact that several other mods that do this on Nexus are no longer updated, are absent of minor tweaks I prefer, and/or are not compatible with Dawnguard/Dragonborn. This mod is also script-free and I plan to keep it that way.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Why would somebody want this?[/i]\n<br />By preventing yourself from using fast-travel, or completely removing the temptation as this mod does, you will find yourself more immersed on your travels through Skyrim. You will discover things, creatures, scenery, and events that you would normally miss by fast-traveling. Even your horse more fully serves a purpose and getting one will feel more rewarding...losing one more harsh. Your average play-through length will obviously be longer across the board. \n<br />\n<br />Maybe it's the old school RPG or Morrowind in me, but I find it more immersive to scour the lands instead of teleporting everywhere. Taking the option completely away from myself helps further. This mod isn't for everybody, but I do know there is a niche for it. \n<br />\n<br />[b]Several things to note:[/b]\n<br />-You still have access to the carriage drivers at Markarth, Solitude, Whiterun, Windhelm, and Riften. In a way with this mod, they now serve a greater purpose other than a one time use to unlock the fast-travel map.\n<br />-The only way to Solstheim now is via boat at 250 septims a trip. I can lower this but for now, I left it alone.\n<br />-I also disabled the fast travel warning messages within the map.\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://blog.atomicreach.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/picard.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[size=10][b]Requirements:[/b][/size]\n<br />1.9 version of game and all three expansions at this time.Â \n<br />\n<br />[i]Note: All plugins in the \"Optional\" and \"Miscellaneous\"download sections are stand-alone.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Load Order:[/b]\n<br />The load order for this mod is simple....[b]last[/b] or near it. There are many mods which will override the little edits I made and re-enable fast-travel.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Known Incompatibilities:[/b] \n<br />I have also been informed that this mod is currently incompatible with a newly released map mod called \"Warburgs 3D Paper World Map\" as his mod contains worldspace cell edits which conflict. Currently, the only solution is to use TESEdit to create a patch, which could be tedious:\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/806594-detailed-paper-world-map/?p=11461810][i]TESEdit patch Instructions[/i][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[size=10][b]Recommended:[/b][/size]\n<br />I recommend using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14950/?][i]Convenient Horses[/i] by Alek[/url] in conjunction with this mod although it is not required. Normally, if you lose track of your horse, a quick fast travel would spawn him near you. Without fast travel, Convenient Horses gives you the option to summon your misplaced horse via a whistle or a horn. It helps a lot with a mod like this.\n<br />\n<br />I also recommend a console command as well: \"set timescale to 10\", (20 is default, 1 is real-time)  A save will lock it in, and \"show timescale\" will tell you what your current save is set on. This makes the game time go a little slower since you're a traveler now, adding to the immersion in my opinion.\n<br />\n<br />Lastly, for those playing or who plan to be playing the amazing mod known as [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11163/?][i]Frostfall[/i] by Chesko[/url], simply forgo using my mod and use his built in feature which does the same thing and won't cost you an additional plug-in. You'll find it in the mod's menu options.\n<br />\n<br />[size=10][b]Uninstall:[/b][/size]\n<br />Simply use NMM to uninstall or delete the plugin from your Skyrim Data directory. This mod does not use any scripts so feel free to uninstall mid-game without worry.\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/drnegative/][center][/center][center][img]http://steamsignature.com/profile/english/76561198039392776.png[/img][/center][/url]",
