  "summary": "After completion of the Thieves Guild questline, Karliah returns to her leather armor rather than wearing her Nightingale set forevermore.",
  "descriptionHtml": "DESCRIPTION:\r<br />\r<br />There&#39;s some unused scripting that indicates Karliah was supposed to return to her brown armor post-&#34;Darkness Returns.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Actually, it would have been changed during &#34;Darkness Returns,&#34; but I figured that the Nightingale aesthetic was appropriate for the Sepulcher.\r<br />\r<br />REQUIREMENTS:\r<br />\r<br />A working copy of the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />\r<br />Place the contents of the .7z file in your &#34;Data&#34; folder, which is usually located under Steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />The ReadMe document and the .bsl file are not required for the mod to run -- you may keep them or discard them.\r<br />\r<br />UNINSTALLATION:\r<br />\r<br />Enter &#34;StopQuest PSKarliahOutfitChange&#34; into the console (sans quotation marks) to return Karliah to her Nightingale armor.\r<br />\r<br />Then delete the included .esp and .bsa file.\r<br />\r<br />The nature of Skyrimâ€™s scripting language, Papyrus, means that, even following this procedure, your Papyrus log will continue to throw errors about missing scripts, potentially leading to save game bloat. There is, lamentably, nothing that I can do about this -- you have been warned.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATING:\r<br />\r<br />Replace all older files with newer versions. If in doubt, replace all mod files with the contents of the latest uploaded archive.\r<br />\r<br />No in-game configuration is necessary.\r<br />\r<br />BUGS:\r<br />\r<br />As of yet, none.\r<br />\r<br />COMPATIBILITY:\r<br />\r<br />This should be compatible with practically any mod.",
