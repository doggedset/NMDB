  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Tahoma][size=3][center][color=#00ff00]THIS NOT-FOR PROFIT MOD CAN BE DOWNLOADED AND USED FREE OF CHARGE[/color][/center][/size][/font]\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][center][img]http://i.imgur.com/WbYsKL1.jpg[/img][/center][/size]\r<br />Need a place to crash in while at Riften, but can&#39;t afford Honeyside yet? Or wish for an extra home for followers? Or that you want a home that can satisfy most of your needs? Built into the Snowshods&#39; manor is the Riften Garret.\r<br /> \r<br />Simple, out-of-the-way, and fills in the boxes. :) No god items, just ready for habitation.\r<br /> \r<br />[b]Features[/b]\r<br />[list][*]Double bed\r<br />[*]Kitchenette\r<br />[*]Personal work desk (includes library, alchemy lab and enchanting table)\r<br />[*]Crafting and upgrade stations (includes anvil, armor table, grinding wheel, tanning rack -- and a mini-smelter&#33;)\r<br />[*]Five-weapon rack\r<br />[*]Small heated bathroom\r<br />[*]Extensive storage\r<br />[*]Can be used as a secondary home for followers (using My Home is Your Home)\r<br />[*]Checked and cleaned with TES5edit\r<br />[*]Auto-strip/re-equip for followers whenever they take a bath, and auto-strip (but no reequip) for your character if he/she sits in the tub.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[color=#e69138][b]Lore[/b] (Spoilers Beware)[/color]\r<br />The legendary Gallus, then the scholarly Guildmaster of Riften&#39;s notorious Thieves&#39; Guild, where under his leadership his guild rose to prominence in the underworld, and at the same time obtained wealth and influence, needed a home for which to easily manage the guild on a day-to-day basis and at the same time allow him to entertain influential guests in complete privacy. \r<br />\r<br />So with the permission of the Snow-Shods (and generous payments of Septims), he had the Garret constructed right above the manor, and reflecting his intellectual prowess, had the home equipped with bookshelves to fit most, if not all, of the knowledge and lore of Tamriel he obtained easily, and then when not at duty would spend his free time reading books obtained across the continent and committing his thoughts to paper on a desk, even editing several rare books concerning the Guild and the Nightingales.\r<br />\r<br />To keep his gear in proper fighting condition, to prepare weapons and armor, and to create potions and poisons needed for specialized work, and with the help of a trusted friend in the College of Winterhold, he also had an enchanting and alchemy table made to order, and moved in several pieces of crafting equipment.\r<br />\r<br />At the end of the day, Gallus would retire to the Garret, strip off his armor and relax in the hot bath, himself he built out of Dwarven pipes and fixtures, thanks to his extensive study of the now-extinct race and their advanced technology. But then the Garret was an also a convenient abode for which to spend intimate time with Karliah, especially on the large bed, as they talked about the future and whom shall be the one deserving to lead the guild if ever should he decides to retire for good.\r<br />\r<br />But tragedy fell when Gallus himself became the victim of his own success, leaving the Garret unoccupied, and thus forcing the Jarl to seize the property as her own. Since then the fortunes of the Guild were reversed, their numbers dwindled, and their wealth vanished, and while many succeeding occupants were able to rent the Garret from the Jarl, for some inexplicable reason the tenants were bestowed with bad luck, which meant the Jarl had the Garret closed for good.\r<br />\r<br />The Garret, now silent, awaits for whoever shall come through its doors, hoping that one would change not just Riften but the rest of the world.\r<br /> \r<br />[b][color=#e69138]Backstory[/color][/b]\r<br />This mod was one made out of necessity -- my character has yet to accomplish several more Riften-related quests but needed a home for the duration until she could finally buy Honeyside. So I created this player home that supports basic crafting, add lots of usable storage, and be able to comply with some realism mods such as Frostfall, and at the same time it&#39;s a sandbox for me to try out ideas in interior design with emphasis on usability.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#e69138]Compatibility[/color][/b]\r<br />This mod is highly compatible with...\r<br />[list][*][size=2][b]Dawn of Riften & Skyrim[/b] (Well... somewhat compatible, considering that DoR/DoS changes Riften&#39;s navmesh. Your follower may have trouble climbing up the stairs or coming out, but will still enter the house. I may try to address this in the next update.)[/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]Frostfall[/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]Realistic Needs and Diseases[/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]My Home is Your Home[/size]\r<br />[/list] \r<br />[b][color=#e69138]Installation[/color][/b]\r<br />NMM: simply install the mod.\r<br />Manual: open the downloaded file with 7zip, and then click and drag the .ESP into Skyrim&#39;s Data folder.\r<br /> \r<br />[b][color=#e69138]Uninstallation[/color][/b]\r<br />NMM: use NMM to uninstall the mod.\r<br />Manual: open Skyrim&#39;s Data folder, find RiftenGarret.esp and delete it.\r<br /> \r<br />[b][color=#e69138]Upgrading (just in case)[/color][/b]\r<br />Take all stored items from containers, chests and racks, and then step out of the house (position yourself at, say, Riften&#39;s market), before making a new gamesave and exiting Skyrim. Use the installation procedure to upgrade the mod, before going back into the game.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ff7700]Credits[/color][/b]\r<br />FPI Research (TESA) for their custom mini-smelter model -- [i]what&#39;s a master thief if he can&#39;t smelt down his loot?[/i]\r<br /> \r<br />[b][color=#e69138]Notices[/color][/b]\r<br />Any changes or alterations to the mod must require my permission.
