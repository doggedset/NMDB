  "descriptionHtml": "Kjorik the Curious is a hunter based in Windhelm. A [i]non[/i]-essential follower (merely protected), he can be [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Boethiah%27s_Calling]sacrificed to Boethiah[/url] or used as a regular follower. He will also buy and sell hunter items (e.g., hides and meat). Find him outside the Windhelm Stables during the day, and in Candlehearth Hall at night. He will level with the player from 5 to 40 and can be married.\r<br />\r<br />His default outfit is bandit furs, leather boots, and executioner gloves. His starting weapons are a hunting bow, iron arrows, and a steel sword. He also carries random hunter items, some food and drink, and a small amount of gold. His NPC class is CombatRanger, and he prefers light armor, bows, and one-handed weapons. He is [i]not[/i] essential (so you [i]can[/i] kill him) and has a standard Nord male voice.\r<br />\r<br />No known incompatibilities. He has an idle marker outside the Windhelm stables, though (at the southwest post holding up the roof, where the horses stand), so something that rearranges the stables&#39; exterior too much might clip it or leave a gap.\r<br />\r<br />This mod has been cleaned with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859]TES5Edit[/url].\r<br />\r<br />If you find any bugs or incompatibilities, let me know in the comments&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Kjorik is also available on the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=207724798]Steam Workshop[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[b]-- Instructions (manual install) --[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Download the zip, then unzip the esp and bsa files to your [i].../skyrim/Data/[/i] folder.\r<br />\r<br />[b]-- Changelog --[/b]\r<br />\r<br />See [i]Changes[/i] tab above.\r<br />\r<br />[b]-- Notes --[/b]\r<br />\r<br />This mod&#39;s filenames are [i]AoM_Kjorik-sacrifice.esp[/i] and [i]AoM_Kjorik-sacrifice.bsa[/i].\r<br />\r<br />Kjorik&#39;s base info in the Creation Kit is under [i]Actors → Actor → AoMKjorikSacrifice[/i].\r<br />\r<br />His BaseID is [i]xx000D62[/i] and his RefID is [i]xx0012C6[/i] (replace [i]xx[/i] with whatever number this mod gets in your game; type [i]help kjorik[/i] (without quotes) in the console to find it).",
