In addition I added the single dynamite and the bomb as clutter object.\r<br />\r<br />A demo esp is included for a quick overview. I placed the objects on top of the Western Watchtower near Whiterun. Don&#39;t let this esp activated when you seriously play your game.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Tools used:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />Blender\r<br />Nifskope\r<br />NifUtils by Skyfox\r<br />Creation Kit\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Permissions:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />This is a modders resource.You may use the meshes and textures for your own mods as long as you give credit and you do not charge money for it.\r<br />\r<br />You may use this resource in Skyrim Special Edition too.
