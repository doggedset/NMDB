  "summary": "Hello everyone! Well this is just a small little mod that I came up with after seeing the \\\"lantern belt\\\" mod. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE :: I added a Pendant of Night Eye AKA Night Vision also, from request. Once again my go to man is Belethor so, he sells this pendant also.   \r\n\r\n All this nifty little mod does is adds a pendant to the game, that creates a hovering light above the wearer of the pendant. I decided to throw this little thing together because my newest character is a 2 handed warrior. It was a real pain to have to run around dungeons with a torch or spell in my hand and then switch to my weapon. \r\n\r\n    Some may say this isnt that big of a deal but for my 5th play through I\\'m gonna play the way I want to! Pendant is sold by Belethor at his General Goods Store in Whiterun. The Pendant does have a nice price tag on it.\r\n\r\n   Hope everyone that does download this mod enjoys it, as it is QUITE simple of a mod. Please endorse if you do like it, it will be much appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer !!:::!:!:!!:!:!:! I may decide to improve upon this pendant by making the pendant actually glow or something. Im new at modding still so....we\\'ll see. Enjoy!\r\n",
