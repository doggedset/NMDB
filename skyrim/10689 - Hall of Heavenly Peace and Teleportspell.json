  "descriptionHtml": "This is a ruin in the northern style. It serves as a home for your Dovahkiin.\r\n\r\nThe ruins include enough space for weapons and armor. \r\nIn the lower part there is a blacksmith with a dealer. \r\nAn alchemist\\'s bench and a table for enchantments are also available!\r\n\r\nIn the last section of the ruin, there are several Doomstones and a teleporter with whom you are teleported to Breeze Home! In Breeze Home is also a teleporter with whom you are teleported back to the ruins!\r\n\r\nV1.4\r\n-I put all Doomstones in the great hall!\r\n\r\n-In the great hall you can no longer fall down and get stuck when you walk across the wooden planks!\r\n\r\n-The teleporter in Breezehome, is now in the alchemy room!\r\n\r\n-I\\'ve placed two bookcases in the entrance Area!\r\n\r\n-I delete the Dog\r\n\r\nV1.3\r\n-The chest of the Dealer is now closed! The Dealer has a key for the Chest.\r\n\r\n-All names are in English\r\n\r\n-The Skeleton is no longer on the Enchantment Table\r\n\r\n\r\nV1.2\r\n-I created a spell, so you can teleport into the ruins. No matter where you been! The spell you can learn in a book, which is in the ruin!\r\n\r\n(Can anyone give a tutorial which explains how to create water in CreationKit?)\r\n\r\nwill build further on the ruins! Criticism and suggestions are welcome!\r\n\r\n(sorry for my bad English!)",
