  "descriptionHtml": "[b][size=4]Introduction\r<br />I made this &#34;mod&#34; just now. The reason I have done this is because I love Malukah and her songs in TESO but I did not have the means to play the game. I live in a rural area in America that has an Internet with speed slower than a turtle race. Therefore, I can only enjoy the songs by importing them into Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />Note:This was made for personal entertainment. I just made it in the spur of the moment so I don&#39;t really know if this is appropriate. If it is not, mods can freely take down this.\r<br />\r<br />What does this do.\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s just a simple file that replace your custom song book of &#34;Become a Bard&#34; mod into a TESO song book. I have no experience with modding so I can&#39;t make a separate song book. If someone wants it to be a separate song book, I don&#39;t know how to do so. If you don&#39;t want it to replace your custom songbook, I cannot comfort your need and you will need to ask somebody with experience in modding or LP. I will just put this here as an open resource for someone who can put it into a separate songbook.\r<br />\r<br />The song was sung by Malukah so it is recommended to use a female character while playing these songs\r<br />It does not have all the songs from TESO because of the limit on custom songs in a single songbook.\r<br />\r<br />Songs used:\r<br />\r<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdcVK47BY0&list=PL47ibCP70Cu0sOzub-XRJUaIRK7HzeWrx\r<br />\r<br />Credits to Velenis for creating this playlist and as well as ZenimaxOnlineStudio for composing the songs\r<br />\r<br />Three Heart As One - Covered by Malukah\r<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TWLy7Iv0Gg\r<br />\r<br />List of Songs and their durations, so that you can edit the performing animation corresponding to the song&#39;s time\r<br />Custom01 - From Dread Daedra Save Us - 2 : 10 - 130 secs\r<br />Custom02 - Mourning The Dead - 1 : 27 - 87 secs\r<br />Custom03 - Ode to the Queen Aryenn - 2 : 02 - 122 secs\r<br />Custom04 - Sway As We Kiss -  1 : 35 - 95 secs\r<br />Custom05 - The Ebonheart Pact - 1 : 59 - 119 secs\r<br />Custom06 - The Plane Meld (Molag Bal) - 2 : 07 - 127 secs\r<br />Custom07 - To Freedom ~High Rock~ - 2 : 06 - 126 secs\r<br />Custom08 - Three Heart As One - 2 : 12 - 132 secs\r<br />Custom09 - Warrior Goddess ~ Mother of Nords ~ - 1 : 22 - 82 secs \r<br />Requirements:\r<br />Skyrim (heh)\r<br />SKSE\r<br />Become a Bard by LP and all its requirements\r<br />(http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=200602183)\r<br />\r<br />How to install.\r<br />\r<br />Install it with Mod Organizer or NMM or (your mod organizer).\r<br />\r<br />Or do it manually by putting the xvm files into Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;Sound&#92;FX&#92;Mus&#92;Bard&#92;Custom\r<br />\r<br />Credit:\r<br />Bethesda for the awesome game\r<br />ZenimaxOnlineStudio for TESO\r<br />Malukah for her beautiful composes and devotion to Skyrim musics\r<br />https://www.youtube.com/user/malufenix\r<br />LP for his awesome mod Become a Bard that enables me to role-play as a real bard\r<br />Steam.
