  "summary": "A small tool to convert draconic bits and pieces to english. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Version History:\r\n\r\nV.0.1:            Initial release\r\nV.0.1.0.1:       Added function to extract font. Also fixed a bug where the options window doesn\\'t show up.\r\n\r\nEver wondered what one/more characters where saying when they switched to draconic for several seconds? Or if there is deeper meaining behind a dragon\\'s name? Now you can decipher it, as this is just a basic tool but also provides anything you need (probably it works with everything from the game but don\\'t expect to write romantic novels for dragons...).\r\n\r\n---- > Yep, I suck at writing desciptions.\r\n\r\nLong story short: This is all what is left and functional of a once big \\\"project\\\" from myself. I eventually got sutck onto details (dynamic translation, modular interface, text recognition ??,...ingame mod) and it never got finished. Now - nearly two years later - I found it again and decided to patch it together, so it work at a minimal ratio. \r\n\r\nWhat it does: \r\n --> TRANSCRIPTION: Take a phrase/sentence or copy whole text (use right click!) and translate it.\r\n---> CONVERSION: Dynamically prints out the draconic equivalent of the text.\r\n\r\nWhat it does not:\r\n----> TRANSLATION: Actual conversion of a languange with proper grammer, endings, senctence order and so on. \r\n-----> STYLE: This is only for writing. If you want different fonts or formats, then use Word.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\nFor now i built cores for English and German. You can either switch them while the program is running or you just add them into the folder.  However, this language was constructed by Americans, so they did not check with German grammar for example and the results are more awful then useful.\r\n\r\nConfig files:\r\nWhen using more than one core file, the program uses the one it find first, when starting (alphabet). You can either switch the core in the \\\"Files\\\"-window then OR create a config file in the \\\"Config\\\"-window. To do that just write the file name into the edit and hit \\'Save\\', then restart. If you are storing the core in another folder, specify the path AND the filename (e.g. C:\\\\MyStuff\\\\File.dov). \r\n\r\n",
