  "summary": "What this mod does:\r<br />\r<br />- Fixes two verticles in the mesh that were causing the pommel texture to stretch onto the handle. Praise to Nifskope and Blender. \r<br />\r<br />- Full retexture of the weapon, including the scabbard. Now it should look much less glowy and a bit more immersive. Praise Nifskope for UV map export and GIMP for texture ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Malacath&#39;s Cleaver\r<br />\r<br />Basically my first mod (of a mod). \r<br />\r<br />You need Hothtrooper&#39;s Immersive Weapons (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27644) for this to work. The original weapon mesh was made by Urwy and can be found in his &#39;URW Useless Resources - Weapons&#39; pack (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12087). If there is any issue with this mod, please contact me. \r<br />\r<br />What this mod does:\r<br />\r<br />- Fixes two verticles in the mesh that were causing the pommel texture to stretch onto the handle. Praise to Nifskope and Blender. \r<br />\r<br />- Full retexture of the weapon, including the scabbard. Now it should look much less glowy and a bit more immersive. Praise Nifskope for UV map export and GIMP for texture creation. ",
