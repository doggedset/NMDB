  "descriptionHtml": "JewelCraft (Craft enhancment and expansion)\r\n**************************************************************\r\nV0.20\r\n[IMG]http://i43.tinypic.com/29eohp4.png[/IMG]\r\nLATEST NEWS\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT!\r\nSorry it has been so long since the last update but I have been VERY busy with work and going back to university. Please read the next section as it can save your game from breaking!\r\n\r\nJewelCraft V0.20 has had some major FormID changes so that it will work in the CK.\r\nThank you very much to blove for doing this in advance and saving me hours of work!\r\n\r\nHowever. This means there may be issues with existing items that are worn. PLEASE back up your save files before updating and when you do take all jewellery you are wearing off (circlets inlcuded) then load the new JewelCraft and Then put it back on. test, then save. Otherwise BAD things might happen.\r\n\r\nI have added all of the Single stone Ebony amulets now. Amethyst, diamond, sapphire, ruby, topaz, garnet, emerald and onyx.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n----------------\r\nOk, I used to be a jeweller and games often irk me with the way they implement jewellery. But in Skyrim there were 2 things that were slightly annoying and 1 that was utterly UNFORGIVABLE!\r\n\r\nThe annoying first. Jewellery was made craftable *YAY* but they didn\\'t allow you to craft circlets. This has been fixed. The other annoying thing is that there are a few rings and amulets in the game but missing a large combination of metals and stones. I mean they don\\'t even have a silver sapphire ring WTF?! So this mod will be aiming to add those things and also differnet combinations of circlet/jewllery gems. I will also be making alot of new meshes of different jewellery designs to really spice things up. So stay tuned.\r\n\r\nTHE UNFORGIVABLE! Steel.... It is made of carbon and iron.... not corundum and iron. For those out there who don\\'t know gemology, corundum is the crystal \\'family\\' that sapphires and rubys belong to. So I have modded corundom and renamed it copper ore and copper ingot. The items that used them in their formula still do, with the exception of steel which is now made with iron ore and 2 charcoal. These actually end up being quite realistic as copper is somtimes used in alloys to harden soft metals and the meshes Including the viens actually look like copper. The other material oddness that irked me was malachite. Also ABSOLUTLY NOTHING to do with glass. So it has been renamed Moldavite which actually IS a type of rare natural green glass. All glass formulas have been left the same, just renamed.\r\n\r\nI will be adding alot more different alloys of metal and alot more different gemstones and jewellery combinations they can be made in to. This will also include more grades of gems. I will do as much as I can for now, but a lot of work might have to wait until the construction set has been released. That way I could make things much faster.\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n*****************\r\nunzip the entire archive into:\r\nSteam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\r\nto uninstall delete \\'JewelCraft.esp\\' and everything in the the Meshes\\\\Armor\\\\AmuletsandRings and textures\\\\Armor\\\\AmuletsandRings folder.

Communities are what make mods grow!\r\n\r\nRebalance costs of either gems or circlets. Doesn\\'t make sense that a sapphire is 400g while the circlet is only 250g and has 3 of them in there. I will either be doing this be changing costs (which will cause all sorts of balancing issues for the leveling lists) or introducing different grades of gems. The most desirable outcome would be if the better grade stones increase the colour and value of the circlets.\r\n\r\nAdd more gemstone types and grades\r\n\r\nAdd more jewellery designs and stone combinations\r\n\r\nMight see if I can add smithing level resrictions on higher value jewellery\r\n\r\nDown the track I would like to add jewelled gauntlets, daggers and armour\r\n\r\nAbility to craft misc items for decorating your house like that golden bee or statues\r\n\r\nJewellery Quests for recipes and rare jewellery/gem artifacts\r\n\r\nJeweller\\'s bench to do the crafting at and move all jewels to that crafting bench.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit\r\n*******\r\n\r\nPretty much all credit goes to AeonVita for letting everyone know how to mod the recipes\r\nYOU ROCK!\r\nAnd Samutz for the original method\r\n\r\nMy wish has come true, there is an ultimate crafty goodness mod that a LOT of mod authors are getting on board with. Check out Tytanis\\' Ultimate Mod now partnered with Jewelcraft.\r\nYou can find it on the address below and JewelCraft exists inside of it in a slightly altered form. So if you do get it you don\\'t need to run JewelCraft aswell.\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1601\r\n",
