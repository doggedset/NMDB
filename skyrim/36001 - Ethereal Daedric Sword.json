  "summary": "Adds an Ethereal Daedric Sword to the game. that can be summoned and banished infinitely (basically an infinite bound weapon, but actually a physical item).",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod makes it possible to call forth an extremely OP Ethereal Daedric Sword to use to your pleasure. Goes great with foster xbl\\'s \\\"True Bound Daedric Armors\\\" and GarryG\\'s \\\"Daedric Armor and Weapon Improvement\\\" mods (links below), and Ghost FX on your character (which is a player.addspell console command). I added new summoning and banishing sounds. The sword itself is invisible when not equipped (to give it that summoning feel), so you won\\'t have some big fiery thing on your side. The reason for it being so OP is because I figured a ghostly Daedric weapon is beyond anything mortal, so naturally, it would kill any mortal without any effort. Sorry if the OP-ness of the weapon bothers you, but you could always change it, I suppose. Hahaha :) It is located in the chest in Breezehome (like.. literally IN the chest. It\\'s right under the lid of the chest. You\\'ll have to turn off clipping to get to it. ;P).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrue Bound Daedric Armors: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34269//?\r\nDaedric Armor and Weapon Improvement: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3104//?",
