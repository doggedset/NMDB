  "summary": "A utility for creating and assembling custom mod packages. Allows for a powerful and flexible pseudo scripted install, creating a single archive out of any number of smaller archives. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a tool for assembling custom packages. If given a bunch of mod archives (.zip, .7z, .rar, ect) it extracts them into a skyrim and data folder, shuffles the files together, and makes a custom installation. This is meant as a resource for modding guides like MGT, STEP, and SR. Anybody can use this to create their own custom mod guide and mod package. It is a powerful and flexible tool for managing files and the extraction of compressed archives. \r<br />\r<br />For Users: Download the user files. Extract it anywhere you like, for example on your desktop or in you downloads folder. Place the source files from the mod package you downloaded into source directory. Put all mod archives into the User directory. Run the ModPackageBuilder.exe. When the program has finished, a new archive will be placed in the user folder. You can extract this manually to your skyrim directory or you can load it using your favorite mod manager. \r<br />\r<br />If you are using windows XP or server 2003, then you will need to download a resource kit. Vista or win7 users don&#39;t need this, its already in your OS:\r<br />\r<br />http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17657\r<br />\r<br />For Package Builders:\r<br />Download the MODCODE and the read the readme. It explains both how the utility works, and how to create your own custom mod package. I will provide a great deal of support to anyone making a serious attempt to use the utility for their own mod or guide. Feel free to post in the discussion board or send me private message if you have questions or concerns. ",
