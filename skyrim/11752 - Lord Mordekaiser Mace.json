  "descriptionHtml": "Thanks for peeking at my mod, this is... well my first one. So be gentle but criticism is more than welcome.\r\n\r\nThis is based on Lord Mordekaiser from League of Legends, easily my favorite champion in the game.\r\n\r\nSince both the champion and my dovahkiin raise the dead I couldn\\'t stop seeing my dovahkiin as Morde and decided I needed to make this weapon.\r\n\r\nThis is a daedric weapon, which can be crafted unenchanted from the forge and upgraded on the grindstone. :]\r\n\r\nAny comments about bugs please email to xjadewolfx@gmail.com, I am aware of the black on the textures, but am unsure how to fix it, please drop me an email or a poke here if you can fix it. :]\r\n\r\nI\\'m also looking for someone decent at skinning armor to help me get meshes of Lord Morde\\'s armor into the game!",
