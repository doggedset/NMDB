  "summary": "My first mod, ever. Was just made for myself, I decided to share it. Don&#39;t expect much.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This little mod adds five spells that use the unrelenting force attacks to push enemies, a spell that makes people go berserk with a health boost, a magelight that does fire damage, a spell that boosts all crafting skills, and a spell that makes lockpicking easier. All spells are added as tomes you can buy and find. Be easy, this is my first mod.",
