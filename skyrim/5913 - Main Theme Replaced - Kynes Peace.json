  "descriptionHtml": "This simple sound mod replaces the main theme with \\\"Kyne\\'s Peace\\\" from Skyrim\\'s soundtrack.\r\n[i]Kyne is the Nordic goddess of the Storm. Also known as Kynareth, she is the widow of Shor and the favored god of warriors. She is often called the Mother of Men.[/i]\r\n\r\nVery gentle, works well in the menu. I didn\\'t tweak the volume as the softness is a nice touch to this song.\r\n\r\nCheers for Jeremy Soule, I eagerly look forward to his next game soundtrack.\r\n\r\n==Installation==\r\n\r\nI hardly doubt you need a tutorial if you\\'ve been using mods for Skyrim before, but just in case, just drag the \\\"music\\\" folder into \\\"Data\\\" (if on XP), or just drag the whole \\\"Data\\\" folder into the root of Skyrim\\'s directory and merge its contents (Vista and above).",
