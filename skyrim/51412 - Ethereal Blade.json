  "descriptionHtml": "\r<br />[Heading]9.9.9[/heading]\r<br />\r<br />Due to the amount of problems (especially the skeleton one which I can&#39;t replicate at all), I will be remaking Ethereal Blade entirely. \r<br />\r<br />I was thinking about replacing the rune system with a experience system, similar to that of Forgotten Magic Redone. Three options occurred to me.\r<br />1. All experience goes to a single pool, which is then spent to upgrade an individual spell.\r<br />2. Each school of magic has a separate pool of experience, which is spent only on spells of the same school.\r<br />3. Each spell has an individual experience pool, leveling once enough is collected.\r<br />\r<br />If anyone reads this, please pick which of the three options you think would be best or suggest an alternative in  the comments.\r<br />\r<br />[Line]\r<br />\r<br />Name: Ethereal Blade\r<br />Version: 2.0.0\r<br />Date: 5/30/2014\r<br />Category: Weapons\r<br />Requirements:    \r<br />[list][*]Skyrim (Updated to 1.9.32.0.8)[*]Dawnguard[*]Dragonborn[*]SkyUI: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863/?]Get here.[/url][*]SKSE: [url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]Get here. [/url][/list]\r<br />Author(s): BlackLink16\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[heading]MOD INFORMATION[/heading]\r<br />\r<br />Description\r<br />===========\r<br />A sword with multiple enchantments and spells.  \r<br />\r<br />Details\r<br />=======\r<br />Note: With 2.0.0, there is now seven elements.  Telekinetic Grasp and Root Grasp may have \r<br />some problems working.  If Root Grasp doesn&#39;t seem to work, upgrading it will increase the \r<br />duration; this might make the effect more noticeable.\r<br />\r<br />The quest for the sword starts when you load the game.  You are given a note to find the dungeon, which the sword is in.  Once the quest is complete, you can start to modify the sword.  The first page in the MCM menu is for choosing what you want enchantment you want on the sword and what spell is in your off-hand.  The spells are always in the left hand, and will override anything originally in the hand when the sword is equipped.  There is an option for no enchantment (the blank sword is only iron quality) and no spell (for use with shields and other spells).  You can equip spells or shields after drawing the sword, only when equipping the sword does it override the off-hand with the spell.\r<br />\r<br />The four elemental pages are used to level the enchantments and spells.  Each level costs runes, which can be purchased at general stores.  The boss also carries a few runes on him.  Leveling the spells increase the power and the cost of them.  All the spells have casting perks for spell cost reduction.  Other perks doesn’t affect the spells.  Maybe in a future update if people want them.  Leveling the enchantments also increases the base damage of the sword.  The highest leveled enchantment has a daedric quality sword. \r<br />\r<br />The sword cannot be crafted nor tempered.  Using the console to add the sword will not work unless you also set the associated quest to stage 100 (which unlocks the MCM menu).  However, killing the boss is the only way to unlock the ability to buy runes.\r<br />\r<br />The enchantments are all vanilla enchantments, and thus are subjected to any mods, which change them.  The spells are nearly all custom, with one (Static Field) using the Breton spell absorb power.  An optional file contains a document with stats on all of the spells.  \r<br />\r<br />The mod was cleaned with TESVEdit.\r<br />\r<br />Known Issues or Bugs\r<br />====================\r<br />Some of the triggerboxes are a bit slow in activating if rushing through the dungeon.  \r<br />\r<br />Finding the runes might be hard.  The runes were added to vendor soul gem lists, but it might take\r<br />a few tries to see someone selling them. Try Riverwood, Lucien definitely can sell them if they spawn.\r<br />\r<br />[heading]INSTALLATION AND UNINSTALLATION[/heading]\r<br />\r<br />Manual Install\r<br />==============\r<br />1.
