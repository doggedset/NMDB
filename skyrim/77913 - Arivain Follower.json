His mother had\r<br />always claimed, that he had Dunmer blood in him, and that his father was killed\r<br />before he was born. He didn’t doubt that at first. Not until his mother was\r<br />killed too, just when he was old enough to become and apprentice. [/font]\r<br />[font=Calibri] [/font]\r<br />[font=Calibri]With no parents who could take care of him, he was sent to an orphanage. Arivain had\r<br />always been talented with magic, he knew a few ‚tricks‘, to attract people\r<br />with, but on the inside, he had always been lonely. No one wanted to adopt him,\r<br />and the other children avoided him too, because of his strange eyes. No one\r<br />could look at them for too long.[/font]\r<br />[font=Calibri] [/font]\r<br />[font=Calibri]But when an old magician found him playing in the streets, showing off one of his little\r<br />‚tricks‘, he decided to take him home, and teach him all he could about magic,\r<br />none the less. And Arivain had been a good student, very interested and\r<br />talented. He dreamt of attending the academy, but he knew that he could never\r<br />afford it. [/font]\r<br />[font=Calibri] [/font]\r<br />[font=Calibri]When the old mage passed away, Arivain was on his own again. Since he didn’t have a\r<br />place to go, nor the money to go to the academy, he decided to find out about\r<br />his roots, while trying to earn as much money as he could.[/font]\r<br />[font=Calibri]He endedupserving as a mercenary in Whiterun, but since people didn’t trust him,\r<br />nor wanted to be alone with him because of his strange eyes, he could hardly\r<br />make the money to pay for his room.[/font]\r<br />",
