  "descriptionHtml": "Ok so I have downloaded many hot female armors from the nexus, but in the game itself there is not many hot females that can wear them...And here we are , I have made five hot female companions who will fit the armors beautifully. REMEMBER where you dismiss them because there they will stay which is great for players who use custom houses, with condition the house you use  have a good navmesh. All of them are located in whiterun, three in the Bannered Mare and two in the Drunken Huntsman. Their level cap is 70. Elanor and  Lessien are ranger class, Raine is mystic class, Valkyrie is one handed  and Thema is dremora class.\r\n\r\nRequired  MODS:\r\nApachiiSkyHair   http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168\r\n\r\nRecommended mods :\r\nBetter Females by Bella  (options\\\\no shine)  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\nCalientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition -CBBE  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\nNatural eyes high res.  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3589#content\r\n\r\nENJOY...\r\n\r\ninstallation : I recommend that you install manually.
