  "descriptionHtml": "[center][font=Trebuchet MS]&#34;I&#39;m just a cook, lass.&#34;\r<br />&#34;We got rooms and food.&#34;\r<br />&#34;Are you hungry ? Thirsty ? Both ?&#34;\r<br />&#34;Food for the Hungry, Drink for the Thirsty &#33;&#34;[/font][/center][font=Trebuchet MS]\r<br />\r<br />Ever wondered why Inn have so little food available, as they serve everyday and everynight food and drinks for the people of skyrim ?\r<br />I did, and i added a lot a food stocks in Inns because ... No really ? Three potatoes and a bottle of Ale in the ONLY DAMNED INN IN SOLITUDE ?\r<br />Especially when you play with a lot of survival mods and immersion you realise that people of skyrim shoudl eat like ..ehm ... Half a potato per week to survive successfully with such an empty stock in Inns.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is currently a short version of the mod a wanted to do but actually its because i dont know how to.\r<br />It should be compatible with everything that does not modifies Inns&#39; LeveledList so ... Majority of mods.\r<br />I would appreciate every bit of information about what i did wrong &#33;\r<br />I apologize for the poor quality of this mod, but im trying to make it better &#33;\r<br />\r<br />I added a version where salt is a non-alchemical ingredient and is considered as food because du to its mineral nature plus the heavy quantity available it should not (in my opinion) be an alchemical stuff.\r<br />Both versions are standalone.\r<br />\r<br />Future updates (?) : 50+ DLs being enough persons for me to take time, I will do some patchs for added food by greats survivals mods if i found some which need it. [s]FOr now im going to make DLC-using versions.[/s][font=Trebuchet MS] [DONE][/font][s] [/s]I wont do any DragonBorn version because there is only Boarmeat and it cannot be cooked in the vanilla game so i find this worthless (but i will treat it if needed)\r<br />\r<br />[center][b]THE HEARTFIRE VERSION IS UP[/b][/center]\r<br />[/font][center][font=Trebuchet MS]It would be great if you, fellow dragonborns, tell me what mod you use, so i can make patch for them.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/font][/center][center][font=Trebuchet MS][b]\r<br />IMPORTANT : The 0.1 version modifies LeveledList that should NOT be modified, change ASAP for the 1.0 Version &#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]IMPORTANT : Though fully compatible with Alternate Start - Live Another Life, It may cause a funny situation, because alternate start pick up in the Inn leveledList to give you your starting items. You now have a lot of food. Nice work.\r<br />\r<br />IMPORTANT : I have an issue, i dont know how to randomize a bit the quantity to seems more immersive\r<br /> if anyone have the solution i would be glad to know.\r<br />[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[/b]\r<br />[/font][/center][font=Trebuchet MS]\r<br />Thank you.\r<br />[u]\r<br />EDIT:I had to remake the entire mod because i used a mod created by someone else as an example to know how to do, and i forgot to change the mod entirely &#33;[/u]\r<br />\r<br />[/font][center][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][b]DO NOT HESITATE TO TELL ME ANY ERROR OR MISSING CONTENT &#33; :)[/b][/size][/font][/center]",
