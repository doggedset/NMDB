  "descriptionHtml": "Hey Guys!\r\n\r\nIf you liked this check out version 2! \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/46002/?\r\n\r\nBreif Description:\r\nThe Storage Facility mod is meant to give you a large area where you can keep all of your items in one place and you can also keep specific things in each chest such as armour and weapons, you have the freedom to do this because there are so many FREAKIN chest boxes! Also, there is a Workbench, Alchemy Workbench, Enchanting Workbench and a bed for when you get sleepy (don't worry it's a double bed for you and your significant other ^_^ if you don't have a significant other, then extra space for you I guess :3).\r\n\r\nIntroduction:\r\nThis is the first mod I have made on Skyrim, it's not the best so I was hoping you can post things that I can update and any cool ideas that I can implement into the mod (it would be much appreciated)!\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\nAs you can see in the first screenshot this Storage Facility is located in Riverwood, and if you can't see the entrance it's at the bottom right of the picture (Sewer hole entrance).\r\n\r\nThe Storage Facility is quite hidden away, so again if you can't see the entrance please refer back to the first screenshot.\r\n\r\nI need your help!:\r\nPlease post below to give me ideas for improvements because at the moment it is pretty bland. Also, if you want the entrance to be moved and many other people do to, I will be more than happy to move the entrance to an easier place or somewhere nearer to a quick travel destination (it's not that far from the Riverwood quick travel destination, but I don't mind moving it)\r\n\r\nUpdates:\r\nAdded NavMesh for followers.\r\nAdded lights.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and I hope you enjoy my first mod!\r\n\r\n~H0N4X",
