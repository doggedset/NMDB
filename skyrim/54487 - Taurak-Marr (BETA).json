Once a mod is installed and running it is highly advised to [b]never[/b] save your game while [b]inside or around player-created content[/b], as this can lead to [b]game content caching[/b].  Basically, the game remembers bits and pieces of a modâ€™s content in your saved game which can possibly cause problems in the future if that same content is changed or updated in any way.  Saving your game in the outside game world helps prevent this from happening.",
