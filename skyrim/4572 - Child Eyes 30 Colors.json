For the sake of completion, I went ahead and provided all eye options (with the exception of the beast races)\r\n\r\nOrc and Elf eyes may not look appropriate, but that\\'s a matter of opinion.\r\n\r\nI have added a screenshot of all eyes, for an general idea of what they will look like. \r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON USE:\r\nTo try a different eye type, just overwrite the file with an alternate. For this purpose I copy, instead of move the file, in case I want to use it again later.\r\n\r\nThe file goes here:\r\nskyrim/Data/meshes/actors/character/character assets/eyeschild.nif\r\n\r\nTo uninstall, just delete eyeschild.nif, and Skyrim will use the default again, just like any other mesh replacer.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wanted to try many different colors, so here we are.\r\n\r\nI have set them to light grey (Image 1), by default. The alternative colors are in the .zip archive.\r\n\r\nTesting lots of variations can be time consuming; your best bet is to go with something normal. Orc and Elf eyes may not look ... human. Blues, greens, greys, hazels should look nice. Dark Elf purple works well.\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to have more variation in children in the future, if each child is created as an entirely new race. We will have to see when the Creation Kit comes out.\r\n\r\n\r\n*This mod requires a playable child race mod, CHOOSE 1:\r\n\r\n- Killable Children by Xylozi\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=774\r\n\r\n- Playable childs and Dremora races by Sagittarius22\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=817\r\n\r\n- Playable children race by SpyderMoHawK\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1066\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will also want:\r\n\r\n-Playable child clothes for child characters, by DeadlyKris \r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4148\r\n\r\n\r\n> For more information on how to even have a chance in surviving, go here: http://childrenofcyrodiil.com/forums/index.php?topic=1896.0\r\n\r\n\r\nMY OTHER UPLOADS:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Rift Performance PLUS\r\n\r\n[*]V s Conjuration Sounds\r\n\r\n[*]Eye Glow Colors\r\n\r\n[*]Catacomb Ambiance\r\n\r\n[*]Rulf, level 1 Imperial, game start, and level 49 game saves \r\n[/list]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=3137532]FIND THEM HERE[/url]",
