  "modName": "The Circle Redone",
  "summary": "Since the Companions are my favorite faction and wasn\\'t really pleased with their overall looks I modified them a bit, but is still tried to keep lore-friendly and well - wolf-ish. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "I tried to keep them looking lore-friendly to a certain degree and I\\'ve used 5 other mods which you\\'ll need in order to get them to look just like the pictures. There are 5 different files in one folder in case you just one to install one. - THIS MOD CHANGES ONLY THE FACES AND NOT THE COMPANIONS DEFAULT OUTFITS.\r\n\r\nApachii\\'s SkyHair\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\r\n\r\nChris57 and FavoredSoul\\'s Better Males - Faces - GeonoxFaces\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488\r\n\r\nNevenbridge81\\'s Natural Eyes\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3589\r\n\r\nCoverwomen Look 2\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3563\r\n\r\nNo More Blocky Faces\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAela - tried to make her more attractive so I removed the tattoo and added a scar (the result of a fright between werewolves). If people will ask for a version with her trademark tattoo I\\'ll add one. I made her thinking she\\'ll look good, but still be fierce and kick arse - and not wearing bikini-type armor. \r\n\r\nFarkas - removed the dirt and the tattoos and cleaned him up in general, changed the hair and the facial hair, but I tried to keep the wolf-ish look without making him look too boyish or effeminate - he\\'s still the two-handed wielding warrior and the throat-ripping werewolf we know and love (or worse - anime-ish).\r\n\r\nVilkas - since he\\'s the intellectual one I tried to make him less grungy and gruff, so I changed a few thing like the hair and the facial hair, removed the dirt etc. He\\'s more clean-cut than Farkas, but will still tear you apart.\r\n\r\nSkjor - I always like him and wished he could\\'ve been a follower. I\\'ve kept his tough/rough warrior look, while giving him better/more proportionate look.\r\n\r\nKodlak - gave him a more pensive/ wise-man look, while still looking like a warrior. He was the one to impart wisdom and reign in the Circle so I wanted to keep that look. \r\n\r\nINSTALL\r\n\r\nJust copy the the .esp and .bsa to your Skyrim/Data folder.\r\n\r\nUNINSTALL\r\n\r\nDelete the .esp and the .bsa\r\n\r\nThe armours - in case someone asks here\\'s what they\\'re wearing:\r\n\r\nAela - TH3WICK3D1\\'s Elite armor recolored - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7807 + Nivea\\'s Winter is coming cloaks - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13486\r\n\r\nFarkas/Vilkas - L0rd0fWar\\'s Witcher 2 Models - the chain mail B and the knight armor (formerly the old version of Saskia\\'s armor for males) - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5588\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: I may be re-doing some major NPC (currently finished Ulfric, Elisif, Tulius and few more) and I plan on doing all of the marriageable companions/followers. Anyways feedback is welcome and I hope you like them.",
