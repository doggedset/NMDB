  "descriptionHtml": "Saw there were no Khajiit Female save games uploaded, which I found to be lame.  Here is my first/main character Rah-Zheed.  She\\'s lvl 44 and has completed the main storyline as well as the college, thieves, empire, and companions stories.  TONS of sidequests have been done as well, but of course there\\'s still tons left to do!  Smithing skill is up to 100, and destruction and enchanting are pretty good as well.  High one handed, just not many skills in it.  She owns most of the ownable houses. (Had to get Hjerm through console commands so it\\'s a little....unusable.  Also don\\'t have the Markarth house.)   Oh, and she\\'s married to Aela the Huntress.\r\n\r\nAlso included is a fresh start save.  Same character, just at the very beginning of the game right as it\\'s her turn to head to the chopping block.  \r\n\r\nSome mods were used in my game such as better night skies, better eyes, and practice bow and arrow, but none that are essential to the game, so no need to download...though you should because they\\'re all awesome mods!\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you\\'re wondering about the weird named ring and necklace...I\\'ve got in to this habbit of only trapping important human souls (like bosses or whatever) for enchanting and I name the enchanted item after the person who\\'s soul goes in to it.  Yeah, I get bored.",
