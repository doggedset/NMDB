[color=#993333][b]Description[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Leave your criminal past behind by using the face sculptor found in Riften&#33; \r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve always found skyrim lacking in an immersive way to lose a bounty without getting yourself caught. This mod makes it so that the using the face sculptor in Riften removes all current bounties placed on the player&#39;s head.  The price of surgery will also increase with player bounty.\r<br />\r<br />2. [color=#993333][b]Installation[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Drop Replace Your Criminal Face.esp into your Skyrim Data folder. I recommend doing this with your favorite mod manager. Requires Dawnguard.\r<br />\r<br />3. [color=#993333][b]Compatibility[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Won&#39;t be compatible with mods that edit the face sculptor or the surgery quest.\r<br />\r<br />4.
