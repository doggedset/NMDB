  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img706/9547/blackjacklogo.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nYou\\'ve waited until the dead of night to start picking the lock of your next target location. As you enter, you realise that the occupant has chosen tonight of all nights to stay up past their bedtime. You\\'d rather not have to resort to spilling their blood, but you cannot pass up the chance to relieve them of their valuables. What do you do?\r\n\r\nThis is where your trusty Blackjack comes into play. Now with a quick sneaky smack on the back of their head, you can go about your business safe in the knowledge that you won\\'t be disturbed for a little while\r\n\r\nSome of you may remember a brilliant mod for Oblivion called \\\"Thieves Arsenal\\\" by Scruggsy. Well, this mod brings the Blackjack to Skyrim. \r\n\r\nFor the measly sum of 2 Iron Ingots and 2 Leather Strips, you can craft the weapon at any forge. It can be found under the iron category.\r\n\r\nWhen used normally, the Blackjack is as fast and has the same reach as the iron dagger, but does only half the damage. But if you are sneaking and your intended target has not detected you, then your hit will make them drop like a sack of potatoes and they will remain that way for 10 minutes. Be sure to make yourself scarce before they wake up, they don\\'t take kindly to being forcibly sedated and will try to hunt you down!\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of how the knock-out effect is scripted, you are unable to loot the unconscious NPC\\'s. I probably could\\'ve found a workaround for this, but decided against it. The weapon could be considered a bit overpowered, but I think this limitation helps to balance it. Also, please note that the knock-out effect only works when the Blackjack is used by the player.\r\n\r\nIf you do not like how long the NPC\\'s stay unconscious for, you will be able to choose a suitable option from the Mod Configuration Menu of SkyUI, if you have it installed (please note: SKSE & SkyUI are NOT required to run the mod, only if you want to configure it to your liking)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\nJust move the esp and bsa files into your \\\".../skyrim/Data\\\" folder and then activate the mod in your load order\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\nThere shouldn\\'t be anything in this mod that sticks to your save (in theory!). To uninstall, first of all make a new save just in case. Now place any Blackjacks you\\'ve made in a container in a respawn-able location (one of the taverns will do). Then fast-travel to the other side of the map and make a new save (don\\'t overwrite the previous save). Now exit the game, remove the mod from your load order, then load the last save again and immediately make a brand new save. Continue playing with this new save from now on. You can now remove the files from your data folder\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nThanks to everybody in the BGS Forum, Creation Kit section. \r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Verteiron for figuring out the original method to render NPC\\'s unconscious and for a very productive conversation\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatured on:\r\n\r\nemmathepony\r\n[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwdLP_n64u4&sns=em[/youtube]\r\n\r\nSam Vincent\r\n[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBIIRia9o60&sns=em[/youtube]\r\n\r\nLiveStyleGaming\r\n[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO1WQFfFeD4[/youtube]\r\n\r\nOther mods by Hypno:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32020]Helmet with Dynamic Visor[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27146]Player Statue[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26260]Wyrmsbane Manor[/url]",
