INFORMATION ON THE MOD           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   This mod gives lots of Nords the ability to use the Fus Ro Dah shout.\r\n\r\n\t   I was thinking that it is kind of sad that Skyrim has this new magic system with \r\nshouts, but almost no one can use them.  There is the player character, the Greybreards, Ulfric\r\nStormcloak, some heroes at Sovngarde, and some high-level draugr, but that is it.\r\n\r\n\t   So I thought it would be fun to make a mod like this where lots of people are always\r\nshouting all the time and the player character gets paid back for all the times he or she has hit \r\nother people with unrelenting force.  \r\n************************************************************************\r\n2. Installation                           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n           Extract (decompress) the .esp to your Skyrim directory.  \r\n(It will be something like *Installation directory*\\\\Skyrim\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data)\r\nMark the box next to the \\\"Nords are Rude and Shout a Lot\\\" plugin in your mod manager.\r\n \r\n           Alternately, extract someplace else.  Then move the .esp to Skyrim\\\\Data.  Mark the \r\nbox next to the plugin in your mod manager.\r\n************************************************************************\r\n3. Version History    \r\n************************************************************************\r\nV 1.0  7/30/12   Initial release.   \r\n************************************************************************\r\n4. Conflicts, Known Issues, and Troubleshooting\r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   This mod is most definitely not lore friendly.  I just thought it would be funny.  I \r\nguess if you wanted to come up with a lore explanation, you could say that most young Nords go to\r\nHigh Hrothgar and live with the Greybeards for awhile so they can learn to shout.\r\n\r\n\t   This mod will conflict with other mods that edit the Nord race.  It will conflict with \r\na lot of mods that edit particular NPCs.\r\n\r\n\t   This is just a joke mod.  I am not really expecting that people will keep it in their\r\nload orders forever. \r\n\t\r\n\t   If you locate a bug, contact David Brasher on TES Nexus so that the situation can be\r\nexamined and can hopefully be fixed. \r\n************************************************************************\r\n5.
