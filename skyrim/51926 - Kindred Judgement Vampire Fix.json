  "modName": "Kindred Judgement Vampire Fix",
  "summary": "Allows the player to proceed with the Kindred Judgement quest as a vampire lord while siding with the Dawnguard",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod makes a minor change to Isran&#39;s blocking dialogue, which makes him insult the dragonborn if conversation is attempted as a vampire. Upon completion of Touching the Sky, the dragonborn will be able to initiate the dialogue with Isran as a vampire, required proceed with the quest Kindred Judgement. No other changes have been made; the dragonborn will not be able to communicate with other members of the dawnguard or complete their quests until he or she has been cured of vampirism. This is a simple change I&#39;ve made for personal use but decided to upload since I couldn&#39;t find anything on the internet; Please comment on any bugs that occur.",
