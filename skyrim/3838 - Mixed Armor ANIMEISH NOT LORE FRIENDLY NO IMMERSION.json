THIS ARMOR IS MADE TO MY OWN PERSONAL TASTES, IF YOU DO NOT LIKE IT FEEL FREE TO WALK AWAY AND LEAVE***\r\n\r\n***this does not include the head used in the images, nor the headdress because I could not find copyright info on them. sorry but please stop asking***\r\n\r\nupdate4: fixed some naming problems in the nif files.\r\n\r\nupdate3: ive done a very poor skin fix, now her skin color will match your face color. However because I simply mapped the UV to a location on the texture that has nothing there will be no textures on her skin but at least it will be better than that bright color...\r\n\r\nupdate2: ive given up on redoing the uv map for the skin, waaay beyond my skill level\r\n\r\nupdate1: hopefully ive fixed the crashes caused by the 1stperson meshes, let me know if you still crash using the new file.\r\n\r\nthe very first armor i converted from oblivion. female only, replaces dragonscale armor set minus the helmet, does not include the head used in the images, nor the headdress because I could not find copyright info on them.\r\n\r\nto install extract the data folder inside the .rar into your skyrim folder\r\n\r\ngauntlets/boots: tona\\'s whitesquall armor\r\ngloves/socks: hepsy\\'s gothppo\r\ncorset: R18PN\\'s amy set\r\nboot sections: hentai\\'s hernisch and serenity armor\r\nother parts: Aridale\r\n\r\nnote the skin textures does not change regardless of your char/race, and it is probably quite bright for a vanilla skyrim.\r\n\r\nthe first person hands have some clipping, and the fingers arent rigged so fingers dont move (they move with the hands)\r\n\r\nthe armor is super skinny because i like skinny girls and i pretty much made everything skinnier, there are no weight sliders, so if you like big girls this probably isnt for u.\r\n\r\ntheres a problem that very rarely when you equip the armor piece your game will crash but ive no idea whats causing it.\r\n\r\ntheres prolly a lotta bug on this but this is my first ever armor mod so any tips r appreciated.\r\n\r\nI originally made this out of random pieces I had in my oblivion folder so I\\'m rly sorry if you made anything in this armor and I didn\\'t mention you, or I\\'m not supposed to release your stuff (but im pretty sure i got every1)\r\n\r\npermission:\r\ndo whatever\r\n\r\ncredits:\r\nexnem for the original eyecandy body in oblivion\r\nRAIAR for the HGEC body\r\nR18PN\r\ntona\r\nhepsy\r\nhentai\r\nAridale\r\n\r\nPS. lots of requests to fix the skin color, hands, and crashes.\r\nthe skin color i would like to fix but i would need to learn how to texture stuff from scratch, i donno anything about texturing, the crashes i would also like to fix but have no clue whats wrong with it, and the hands, im probably not going to bother until I fix the other 2 problems. If any1 wanna help/gimme tips that\\'d be nice.",
