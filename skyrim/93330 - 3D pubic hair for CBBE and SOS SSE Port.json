  "summary": "This is the special edition port for 4uDIK1's 3D pubic hair for CBBE and SOS. Textures and meshes have been optimized to work with SSE.  All credits go to the original author!",
  "descriptionHtml": "You'll need SOS Full OR Lite for SSE.  the pubes only show on the \"Smurf Average\" shape, so make sure you have that selected if you've installed SOS Lite, if you have SOS Full simply go and select \"smurf average\" from the MCM menu..  that's how the original mod was made, i may try to adapt it for the rest of the shapes in the future but no promises for now! \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />If you want to use the pubes on your female character only and not for all female NPCs, i highly recommend using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3006]Unique Character [/url]﻿and manually moving the meshes and texture files for CBBE Pubes to their corresponding folders.  \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />As for SOS, all males who use Smurf Average penis will have those pubes!",
