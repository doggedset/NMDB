  "descriptionHtml": "Featured in Gamespot\\'s top 5 mods of the week! Check it out here: http://youtu.be/koIpxX1JCsI?t=8m20s\r\n\r\nHello! Its 3PSQWERTY back with a brand new mod. This mod addresses a feature that I have thought was missing from this wonderful game for quite some time. Smithing is a slow and tedious process to level up. also, if a smelter is available, why can\\'t weapons be smelted down into their base metals? So, thats what this mod does. Weapons can be smelted back into most of their base ingredients. Be sure to let me know about any bugs or any ideas you have for future versions of the mod. Yes, this system can be abused, but it is also realistic, so don\\'t complain about how its abuseable, its not my fault that you are tempted into abusing it. Thanks! \r\n\r\nUPDATE: Basic Jewelery has now been added, all gold necklaces with gems can be taken to a workbench, and the gems can be extracted from them. Unfortunately, due to limits with the creation kit, I can\\'t also return gold ingots.\r\n\r\nHere is what can be smelted: \r\n\r\n-Iron Weapons \r\n-Steel Weapons \r\n-Elven Weapons \r\n-Dwarven Weapons \r\n-Silver Weapons \r\n-Ebony Weapons \r\n-Orcish Weapons \r\n-Glass Weapons\r\n-Gold Jewlery (WIP)\r\n\r\nHere is what cannot be smelted: \r\n\r\n-Silver Jewlery (WIP)\r\n-Daedric Weapons\r\n\r\nMy plans for the next update:\r\n-Being able to remove jewels from jewlery and smelt down jewlery\r\n-adding glass weapons\r\n-any ideas the community has!\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nYou need to have Skyrim 1.9.32 or later to install, thanks to the wonders of steam auto update...\r\nthen, just download with manager!\r\n\r\nFAQ:\r\n-This mod is so abuseable!\r\nI know. But, you still need other ingredients to keep crafting. If somebody truly wanted to abuse smithing, all they need to do is open the console and type player.advskill blacksmithing 1000\r\n\r\n-It won\\'t install!\r\nCheck your data folder to see if the ReverseCrafting.esp is there, and make sure your skyrim is up to date.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I run a Youtube channel dedicated to teaching people to mod various games and creating engaging content. A mod spotlight will be going up shortly. check me out here: http://www.youtube.com/user/3PSQWERTY ",
