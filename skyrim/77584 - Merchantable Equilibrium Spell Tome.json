  "descriptionHtml": "Merchants will now sell the Equilibrium spell tome that can normally only be found in the Labyrinthian ruins during &#34;[size=2]The Staff of Magnus&#34; quest for the college of winterhold. This is useful to those that wish to obtain this spell but don&#39;t want to start the College of winterhold quest line just to get it.\r<br />\r<br />[/size]The spell itself is an alteration spell that drains 25 health per second and converts it into magicka. This can be used to give yourself an extra magicka boost when you have the health to spare.\r<br />\r<br />Another use for it is to aid in restoration leveling. With this spell in one hand and a healing spell in the other, casting them both at the same time will allow you to create a loop of restoration experience. If you are losing health too quick for this to be worth it you either need to turn down your difficulty settings or acquire a higher level healing spell.",
