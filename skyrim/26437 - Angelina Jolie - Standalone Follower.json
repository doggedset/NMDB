If you want her to wear the armor I gave her, talk to her, make her a follower, trade with her, take anything out of her inventory and give it back, she will now wear her items normally. Or make her a follower then enter any other cell (a door or something) on the other side she will be wearing her armor as normal.\r<br />\r<br />#4 HELP, she keeps using a shield in close combat, what&#39;s up with that? I thought she was now a dual wielder&#33;\r<br />She will always prefer to use a shield when there is 1 in her inventory, make sure you don&#39;t give her a shield and make sure she always has 2 1handed weapons in her inventory..\r<br />\r<br />#5 I&#39;m using the CBBEv3.2 version 1.2 and her body appears to be black, what do I do?\r<br />To fix this problem problem .. If you are using the CBBE3.2 version I recommend doing the following, \r<br />\r<br />1- Go to this mod page\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666]Calientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition -CBBE-[/url]\r<br />2- Go to Files tab\r<br />3- Scroll down to the optional files\r<br />4- Download CBBE v3-2 High Medium and Low resolution textures\r<br />5- Extract it on the desktop or something but not to the game files\r<br />4- Open the extracted folder, (pick a body texture quality that suits your pc, either High or Medium or Low) proceed to &#34;Textures&#34; &gt; &#34;Actors&#34; &gt; &#34;Character&#34; &gt; &#34;Female&#34; and copy the 3 files inside &#34;femalebody_1, femalebody_1_msn and femalebody_1_s \r<br />5- Go to your skyrim folder SteamsteamappscommonskyrimDatatexturesactorscharacterAngelina Jolie and paste them there, when it asks to overwrite say yes ..\r<br />6- Your black body problem should be fixed now, if it doesn&#39;t get fixed, try the texture files in the &#34;Low&#34; folder that you downloaded ...\r<br />\r<br />#6 I want to marry her but no conversation options show up about marrying her (Interested in me?) what do I do?\r<br />Go to Riften and talk to Maramal (he will be either in the Temple of Mara or in the Bee and Barb inn) then ask him about how marriage works in skyrim, also acquire an Amulet of Mara and equip it, once that&#39;s done, any eligible spouse will start mentioning to you how amazing and awesome you are and how it&#39;s hard to believe you are not taken yet, the dialogue option for marrying them should show up now (Interested in me?)\r<br />\r<br />#7 Make her a playable preset please&#33;\r<br />Sadly, it&#39;s not as easy as it sounds and here is the reason why.. Angelina&#39;s face is custom and the headmesh (inside the facegeom folder) used by her was edited by hand (by Omega99jp) to make it look like Angelina , there is no way to replicate her custom face using the face morph sliders.. However there is a much more advanced way which is making a race with her as a preset for that new race, the only problem is that there is no way (AFAIK) to convert a follower headmesh to a race headmesh, the only solution around that is to rebuild her face from scratch on a race headmesh which would consume a lot of time and I personally lack the skill set to do it myself ..\r<br />\r<br />#8 Where can I get the other npcs in your screenshots?\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15808]Migals Housecarl Beauties[/url]\r<br />And [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24900]Camilla you Whore[/url] -Contains ADULT Images-\r<br />[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]#### CREDIT and PERMISSION####[/color][/b]\r<br />FULL CREDIT GOES TO Omega99jp and I got permission from him to include all his original files into my mod\r<br />Both the body meshes and textures are based on the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709]UNP female body by Dimon99[/url] so credit goes to him as well\r<br />Both the body meshes and textures of the CBBE version were taken from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666/]CBBE Big Bottom Edition by Caliente (Warning: Contains ADULT content)[/url] Full credit goes to her for giving me permission to include her files",
