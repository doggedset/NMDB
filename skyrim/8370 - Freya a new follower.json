  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod ever so any and all constructive criticism is appreciated :)\r\n\r\nadds a wood elf named Freya to the sleeping giant inn. all u have to do is ask her to follow you and thats it plain and simple, i modeled her after Faendal and she specializes in archery, 1-handed, and light armor and her level also scales with the player up to 80 so she can be a valid late game follower\r\n\r\nMods i used for specific look:\r\nBright eyes 1.3\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2464\r\n(u just need the wood elf eye if your picky about the eye pack you use)\r\nCover Women\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3563\r\n(type 4)\r\n\r\nthe only small issue you might (most likely will) have is that the head colors don\\'t match the body color\r\nthis is a weird CK issue that a lot of the modding community has been having and no one apparently knows how to fix yet, but Beth is looking into the whole issue\r\n\r\n===========================================\r\n\r\nFuture Plans:\r\n\r\n- a new tank follower\r\n- possible spell-sword follower\r\n- I\\'m going to attempt a mini centurion pet (won\\'t replace follower)\r\n\r\n=============================================================\r\nTips for making your own follower:\r\n\r\nin factions make sure u have \r\nPotentialFollowerFaction = 0 (from what i read this gives u the \\\"i need your help\\\" dialogue) \r\nCurrentFollowerFaction = -1 \r\nin relationships make a new form and in the \\\"Child\\\" field go all the way to \\\"P\\\" and find Player then set your relationship to what you see fit (i suggest Ally) \r\nand make sure in \\\"scripts\\\" you add \\\"CarryActorScript\\\" this lets you open the npc\\'s inv if not then it just sends u back to the dialogue choices \r\n\r\nim not sure if you need it but if that still doesn\\'t work add \\\"DunPlayerAllyFaction\\\" to factions",
