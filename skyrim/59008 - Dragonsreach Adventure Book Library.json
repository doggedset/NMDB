  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Hello[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b]About this Mod:[/b]\r<br />After many years of stalking the Nexus, I thought it was about time that I created a mod myself. So I bit the bullet, or rather the arrow, (which is not easy when it&#39;s sticking out of your knee, I can tell you) and created this small mod.\r<br />\r<br />[b]What is this Mod?:\r<br />[/b]This just adds a small library to the far end of the right-hand[i] mezzanine[/i] as you enter the main hall of Dragonsreach, which I always thought looked a bit empty anyway. It contains a few items of furniture, a little decoration, and at the moment, four books containing short stories, written by yours truly. It uses vanilla assets, is completely lore-friendly and has had the nav-mesh tweaked so as not to cause problems with npcs. The books are set to &#39;Player&#39; so can be taken without having to resort to thievery ;)\r<br />\r<br />Non of the DLCs are required for this mod.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation:\r<br />[/b]Use NMM or download and extract the &#39;Adventure books.esp&#39; (no other files are needed) and place in your Skyrim Data folder. Load order is probably unimportant but, as usual, later is probably better than earlier.\r<br />\r<br />NB. SHOULD RUN FINE ON SKYRIM SPECIAL EDITION TOO.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Version history:\r<br />\r<br />[/b]V1.0  ........... Contains three books: Draugr Tomb, The Giant Whisperer, Lost Legionary.\r<br />V1.1  ........... New book added: Mage&#39;s Mistake.",
