  "descriptionHtml": "REQUIRES DAWNGUARD! BEAST, MALE, FEMALE, ORC, MER SUPPORT! WEIGHT SLIDER DOESN\\'T WORK YET!\r\n\r\nOkay, I\\'ve been working on this set of gear for mid-to-long time.\r\nI\\'ve had numerous issues during the creation process, and that is going to explain most of the bugs you might encounter. \r\nThus I really hope you backup your save. Even if it\\'s just a piece of armor.\r\n\r\nWhat this mod does?\r\nAdds craftable items TO SKYFORGE. NO OTHER REQUIREMENTS. NOTE! ARMOR PARTS ARE UNDER MISC SECTION, HAND AND BOOK UNDER JEWELRY\r\nThe items:\r\nOblivionwalker Hood (Horned hood)\r\nOblivionwalker Helmet (Recolored Glass helmet, looks a bit similar to Lich helmet from oblivion)\r\nOblivionwalker Robes \r\nOblivionwalker Gloves (Bandages)\r\nOblivionwalker boots (Mix\\'n\\'matched set of boots)\r\nDestructonomicon Wearable book, grants you invisibility and muffle on sneak, increases magic resistance by 10%, damages health and stamina regeneration rate by 75% AND gives you the spellbreaker effect while blocking\r\nHelping hand Wearable hand in a quiver on your back. Fortify conjuration by 10%, increases the potent of conjuration spells by 20% (Length), and increases magic resistance by 15%\r\n\r\nThis supports both, male and female, human, mer and beast. (Didn\\'t test orc though but it should work)\r\n\r\nStats suck now.\r\nI know it, you don\\'t have to say it.\r\nWhat I do want you to say is better idea for the stats.\r\n\r\nBUGS:\r\nEh, there might be many, there might be none.\r\nI had to pack this mod manually because creation kit started to talk to me about bsshader bug, and I haven\\'t yet been able to figure out why it\\'s acting like that.\r\nWEIGHT SLIDER IS NOT WORKING!\r\nI had made the male and female _1 versions, but when I tested them in-game, they went full retard when I equipped them.\r\nHowever, as this requires Dawnguard you are able to walk into Ragged Flagon and change your apparance, thus your weight too.\r\n\r\n",
