  "descriptionHtml": "Requires:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22602/\r\nand\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286/\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n-Must be using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286]Skyrim Redone[/url]\r\n-Install [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22602]Witcher 2 Style Dawnguard and Standard Heavy Plate[/url]\r\n-Install my ESP\r\n-Uncheck the original \\\"Baraban-Dawnguard-Plate_SkyRe.esp\\\"\r\n-Make sure both \\\"SkyRe_Main.esp\\\" and my \\\"SkyRe_Plugin_Witcher 2 Style Dawnguard Armour.esp\\\" are loaded.\r\n\r\n*Should still work perfectly fine with Baraban\\'s Steel Plate replacer*\r\n\r\nTo install you MUST install Baraban\\'s mod FIRST(before or after SkyRe doesnt matter), then install my ESP. [b][u]Do not load both my ESP and Baraban\\'s original \\\"Baraban-Dawnguard-Plate_SkyRe.esp\\\" [/b][/u], just use mine as replacer/modified version.\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not remove the items from Gunmars vendor list so you can still buy them normally, nor did I edit any of the stats. I added the recipes for crafting at the forge(theyre under Steel), meltdown recipes, and tempering recipes - all with the same requirements/stats as regular Steel Plate which is slightly better than the normal Dawnguard heavy set already. I DID add in some Vampire Dust as one of the crafting ingredients though, because I had a ton of it and I thought it made it more interesting :p\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nThanks to LordOfWar for taking the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5588]Witcher 2[/url] models to Skyrim, and LordBaraban for the epic [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22602]retexture[/url]. The vanilla Dawnguard heavy set was pretty lackluster so I when I saw this armour set I fell in love, and as a SkyRe user making it compatible was the next logical step.",
