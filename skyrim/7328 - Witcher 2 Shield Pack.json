  "summary": "Adds 20 new craftable and improveable shields",
  "descriptionHtml": "DESCRIPTION:\r\nThis shield pack adds 9 heater shields, 5 pavise shields, 4 longer kiter-type shields, 1 spiked shield and 1 round  from the Witcher 2 into Skyrim. \r\nAll can be crafted (some with the steel smithing perk) and can be found in the Studded menu, also improveable at the workbench. One of the ingredients is firewood, because it meant little sense to me to have wood in the game and not have shields made out of it.\r\n====================\r\nCONTENTS:\r\nShield of Redania\r\nShield of Temeria\r\nShield of Kaedwen\r\nShield of Aedirn\r\nShield of the Free Company (Adam Pangratt\\'s shield)\r\nShield of Dethmold\\'s Guard (alternative names welcome!)\r\nShield of La Valette\r\nShield of Ancient Kaedwen\r\nPlain Wooden Shield\r\nWorn Round Shield\r\nSpiked Shield\r\nShield of Redania (kite)\r\nShield of La Valette (kite)\r\nShield of Baron La Valette\r\nShield of the Flaming Rose\r\nPlain Pavise \r\nPavise of Nilfgaard\r\nPavise of Nilfgaar (variant)\r\nPavise of Kaedwen\r\nPavise of Dethmold\\'s Guard\r\n=========\r\nFUTURE VERSIONS:\r\nThere will be some things that I will get around to doing and these include:\r\n1. Possibly less glossy versions for some of these depending on feedback\r\n\r\n=========\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\nExtract folders under meshes to your meshes folder and likewise for the textures. Place the .esp file into Skyrim/Data, then make sure it\\'s ticked in the Data Files part of the launcher.\r\nOnce in game, go to forge and find them under Iron (I changed my mind when doing the recipes and made them require steel, so this is a mistake here and will be changed to steel with the CK), BUT... you still need the steel perk.\r\n==========\r\nCREDITS:\r\nMeshes and textures belong to CD Projekt Red, the developer of the Witcher 2 (http://www.thewitcher.com/), who have very generously allowed the use of their game assets by modders provided they are given credit.\r\nI have extracted all materials from the Witcher 2 game files, exported them to Blender, edited them, and then ported them into Nif format.\r\n\r\nIf you use these, I only ask that you give me credit for porting them over :)",
