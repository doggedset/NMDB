So I made a file which tweaks the Entropy spells as I had imagined them. \r<br />\r<br />So the way I imagined entropy was a health-based High risk- High reward caster. So I buffed the damage by ~ 50% for Death spark and ~100% for Death Breath and lowered the base Mana cost by 50%.\r<br />Devour Soul has been buffed to absorb more health from dead enemies. Boosted to 25%/50%/75% up from 15%/20%/30%.\r<br />\r<br />File comes as is with no support.\r<br />\r<br />If you don&#39;t like the buffs you can edit them using TES5Edit.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />",
