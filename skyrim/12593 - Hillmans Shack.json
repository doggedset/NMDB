  "descriptionHtml": "Hillman Hunter Shack\r\nCatagory: Homes and Abodes\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Description:[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nA home fit for a hunter located in a nice area, east of Valthiem Towers and Darkshade Cave. Made for the hunter in mind, it is a small cabin in a wooded area next to a river. But there is also a nice storage cellar and a largish display room in a forested cave for you to display your best items. The place is locked up though so you\\'ll have to find the key. It is located near the shack, if you want to know where I will spoil it later. There is a note near the entrance providing some backstory.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Features:[/u][/b]\r\n\r\n[b]All obligatory crafting stations[/b] - as per standard.\r\n\r\n[b]Storage[/b] - Should be just enough storage, didn\\'t go overboard.\r\n\r\n[b]Lockable doors[/b] - Don\\'t want anyone just waltzing in do you?\r\n\r\n[b]Automatic Lights[/b] - Cabin lights turn off at 7am and turn back on at 6pm.\r\n\r\n[b]Bookshelves[/b] - 4 bookshelves in the cabin and 10 more in display room.\r\n\r\n[b]Mead barrel[/b] - Pour some mead by clicking on the barrel.\r\n\r\n[b]Fishing[/b] - On the pier out the back is a fishing rod collection, click on them to start fishing.\r\n\r\n[b]Auto storage[/b] - For food, all ingredients, potions and poisons, soul gems and scrolls, and crafting items.\r\n\r\n[b]Hunters Bow[/b] - Does 10 points of damage to animals, the effect does not work on anything else.\r\n\r\n[b]Display weapons[/b]- Weapon plaques, racks, display cases.\r\n\r\n[b]Mannequins[/b] - 11 resident mannequins.\r\n\r\n[b]Command animal spell[/b] - Just the Bosmer command animal power, in spell form. Book is on the shelf next to the bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Un/Install:[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nPut the ESP & BSA files into Skyrim/data folder.\r\nTo remove, delete or remove associated files.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Bugs, incompatabilities:[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nThere is another mod (A castle type mod) that used the same area. It completely covers the shack, so obviously only use one or the other. The shield of Ysgramor (Spelling?) doesn\\'t display on the shield rack quite right, it\\'s not too bad, just a little off. But I just discovered in the CK that the shield IS a little wonky so it probably displays the same on vanilla player house plaques. Also the Axe of Whiterun. Don\\'t know why, everything else is ok. Those plaques are just copies of the ones in other player houses. You could display that shield on a mannequin instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Location of the key:[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nDon\\'t read if you want to try and find it yourself............It\\'s under the shack, under the cooking fire, in an iron kettle. Take the kettle or move it and tip it upside down, the key should fall out.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][u]Credits:[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nBethesda for the game\r\nNexus for a great place to upload files\r\nTomHart for the sorting script\r\nCipcis for the light script\r\nAnyone else I may have missed",
