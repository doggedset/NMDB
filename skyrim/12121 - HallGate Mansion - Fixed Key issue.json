This home is on a semi large scale, being a mansion\r<br />that is based on the BlackBriar Chalet. The outer model remains the same, but the interior has been completely revamped...every item has been\r<br />deleted and the walls and rooms have been remade. The result is a completely new home, refined for those with expensive taste but still like simple\r<br />interior design. Outside the home is a new area too, all secluded and tucked away from prying eyes by a fully surrounding and high walled walkway.\r<br />No more will pesky thieves just wander in&#33; Or villagers attempt an attack on your precious home&#33; \r<br />\r<br />The rear of the house supports a viewing balcony, with views of a beatifull pond. Leading to this pond from your own private stable is an above ground walkway.\r<br />-----------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-----------------------------\r<br />[COLOR=YELLOW]HOW TO FIND HallGate Mansion[/COLOR]\r<br />-----------------------------\r<br />\r<br />This home and area is located west of Whiterun, it is fairly obvious as it has a large surrounding wall and many high trees visible behind it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />====================\r<br />[COLOR=LIGHTBLUE]FEATURES IN THIS MOD[/COLOR]\r<br />====================\r<br />\r<br /> - Crafting facilities contained\r<br />  \r<br /> *Furnace\r<br /> *Workbench\r<br /> *Sharpening Wheel\r<br /> *Cooking Stove\r<br /> *Tanning Rack\r<br /> *Enchantment Table\r<br /> *Alchemy Table\r<br />\r<br /> - Plenty of storage for all your items, placed in handy areas and near crafting utilities\r<br />\r<br /> - Weapon racks, 4 in the dining area and 1 beside your bed\r<br />\r<br /> - 3 mannequin beside your bed\r<br />\r<br /> - Beautifull open plan design inside mansion\r<br />\r<br /> - Bar with cosey socialising area\r<br /> \r<br /> - Larder with collectable items\r<br />\r<br /> - Balcony, reached from upper floor door\r<br />\r<br /> - Nice homely room for your companion\r<br />\r<br /> - Beautifull pond out back\r<br />\r<br /> - Another pond near entrance\r<br />\r<br /> - Wooden walkway to home from gate\r<br />\r<br /> - Inside home fully navemeshed from scratch\r<br />\r<br /> - Insects and fish\r<br />\r<br /> - A map marker for easy travel to this location once found\r<br />\r<br /> - A dragon skull with fire breathing magic cast on it in the main dining room\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />============\r<br />   [COLOR=LIGHTBLUE]PLANS[/COLOR]\r<br />============\r<br />\r<br />These are some things im planning to do with this mod ( Only one to go now&#33; )\r<br />\r<br /> * Make a mission to gain access or the key to this home and front gate - possible story from previous owner\r<br />\r<br />=======\r<br />[COLOR=RED]Version[/COLOR]\r<br />=======\r<br />\r<br />[COLOR=YELLOW] *UPDATED 12.03.2012*[/COLOR]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />V3 - ESSENTIAL UPDATE&#33;&#33; Now fully Navmeshed&#33;\r<br />\r<br /> - Navmeshed the grounds outside the house from scratch\r<br />\r<br /> - Fixed Navmesh to doorways in and out of house\r<br />\r<br /> - Fixed Navmesh up stairway to master bedroom in home\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: Please make sure you only have one version of this mod installed.
