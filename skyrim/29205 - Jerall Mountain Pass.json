  "modName": "Jerall Mountain Pass",
  "summary": "This plugin adds a small Nord Ruin, Imperial Guard & Trading Post in the Jerall Mountains.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I made this plugin to correct some terrain mistakes in the vanilla game and add some more detail and life to this area. You can fast travel to location. You will find horses, structures and NPC\\'s.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2.0\r\nFixed minor lighting problems in temple & tweaked Companion attributes. All Texture & Mesh folders cleaned and added. There should not be a grey face bug problem anymore!\r\n* I would recommend using a body/face replacement mod so the companions look better then vanilla. I\\'m using CBBE and high rez textures available at the nexus.\r\n\r\nThis mod has been cleaned with TESVEdit.\r\nNavmesh checked and Follower friendly.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\nUnzip\r\nPlace in Data folder. C:/Program Files(x86)/Steam/Steam Apps/Common/Skyrim/Data\r\nNMM should work as well.\r\n\r\nUNINSTALL: \r\nJust delete plugin.\r\n\r\nBugs: \r\nYou may get \\\"grey face bug.\\\" If so you will need to export the face gen data with CK using \\\"Ctrl\\\" key & \\\"F4\\\" not my fault. Game is just buggy. The face gen data is included so in theory the game should find it. But...\r\n\r\nYou can enter & exit the Trading post just fine BUT if you travel with companions some times they will not leave when you exit. I made the interior cell a place to fast travel from. So just leave via fast travel and all will be well. Nothing I can do. Navmesh is the problem and I\\'m not going to do major re-work to it.\r\n\r\nCredit:\r\nThe good folks at Nexus \r\nThe developers of TESVEdit\r\nBethesda\r\n\r\n\r\n",
