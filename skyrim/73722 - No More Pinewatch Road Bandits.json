  "descriptionHtml": "Very simple: removes the two bandits on the tiny encampment over the road from Falkreath to Lakeview Manor. I got tired of fighting the same two low-level punks every time I wanted to go into town, so I deleted their spawners. Also removes the traps.\r<br />They&#39;re not challenging and they don&#39;t add anything to the game, they&#39;re just annoying. All they do is scream, shoot barely-damaging arrows, drop rocks on the road (along with a huge pot that I am 100% sure they use as a toilet), and mark you as &#34;in combat&#34; until you climb up into their fort and one-shot them. Besides, it doesn&#39;t make sense that bandits could set up shop in the open (as opposed to deep underground in Pinewatch proper) on the short road between the hold&#39;s capital and the [b]Dragonborn&#39;s[/b] home. I also removed the rock/kettle traps themselves because they&#39;re triggered by walking near them, not by any switches or anything. If there are no bandits, there shouldn&#39;t be any bandit traps going off on their own.\r<br />\r<br />All this mod does is remove the two bandit&#39;s spawners, traps, and trap triggers. It shouldn&#39;t conflict with anything unless it alters those particular bandits or their traps, which is unlikely.",
