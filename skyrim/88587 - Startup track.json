  "descriptionHtml": "Taken from a really bad straight to dvd title &#39;Knights of Steelblood&#39;, pretty much the only good thing about it really (well I thought anyway). I&#39;m probably breaking copyright laws here (NO. I know I am) but the intro track is just too damn good to let fade away. The original is roughly 55 secs long and just loops but the end is very abrupt so I cut off a second or two and faded it with Ocenaudio (a free audio editor, check it out) then used the one and only &#39;Skyrim Audio Converter&#39; tool from JohnB (Thank you so much JohnB&#33;) with the highest settings. If this makes it through, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Place &#39;mus_maintheme.xwm&#39; into &gt; Skyrim/Data/music/special folder and load up Fas Do Rah&#33;\r<br />Uninstallation:\r<br />Delete &#39;mus_maintheme.xvm&#39;. Bam, and the track is gone&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Using Linux Mint 17.3 KDE 64bit running latest version of Wine and am damn grateful that Skyrim runs almost flawlessly under it&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />*Sorry people, had it in the wrong category. 1st time ever uploading anything Skyrim&#33;",
