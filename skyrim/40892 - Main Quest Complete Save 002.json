  "descriptionHtml": "I couldn\\'t find a save game with a low number, so I made one, well three (3), for people who wanted one.\r\n\r\nThe Main Questline is complete. It will put you in Sovenguarrd (sic).\r\n\r\nBleak Falls Barrow and Ustengrav is complete, but I left all the treasure, etc.\r\nintact (as much as was possible, this includes NPCs) if you want to \\\"re-raid\\\"\r\nthose areas.  \r\n\r\nYou have an Amulet of Mara (bought from Maramal) if you wish to get married \r\nright away.\r\n\r\nI have three (3) files. First one is with the main quest only. Second is with main quest and civil \r\nwar complete (Imperial). The third is main quest, civil war (Imperial), and Thieves Guild Completed.\r\n\r\nIf you have ever wanted to start a new character and save game with a low number -- this is it.\r\nMy personal favorite is \\\"the big 3\\\" [all 3 quest lines complete]... this save \\\"saves\\\" me countless hours starting a new character.  I am Guild Master, Dovakin supreme, and I kicked Ulfrics rear. All this without having to play 2 days to get to this point. I bought the house in Riften and you have enough money to go back and buy the one in Whiterun and upgrade.\r\n\r\nI hope this fulfills the \\\"save game\\\" some have asked for.  Thank you.  I am marking \\\"adult only\\\"\r\nonly to be safe.  It should be, but please check for yourself. Only requires Skyrim with latest update. 1.9.something\r\n\r\nUse this all you want, just credit me.\r\n\r\nDescription Update: You will be Level 1 with all skills at 15\r\n\r\nSPEEDMULT IS SET REALLY FAST! Please use [player.modav speedmult -#] to accomplish a\r\nslower game.  Read through the posts if you have any questions about this.\r\n\r\nPlease if you like these don\\'t forget to endorse.\r\n",
