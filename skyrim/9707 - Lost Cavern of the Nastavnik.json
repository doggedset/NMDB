If people keep having problems, i shall move all the items to a new file incase i bumped something when copying sections of other maps to remove bugs i was having.\r\n\r\nMessage from Vil: When you enter the cavern, there are 2 books on pedestals, the one on the left is my log book of work im doing, have done, and will be doing, as well as known bugs and things i would like your input on.
