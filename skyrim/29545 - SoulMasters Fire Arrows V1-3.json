(although I am quite pleased with the look of the arrows)\r\nA2 Now I have re-textured everything hopefully they look a little better?!\r\nA3 Now ewi65 has done the textures they are totally awesome!!\r\n\r\nQ I\\'m forever running out of Firewood to craft the Arrows and there\\'s just not always a handy woodblock - can you help?\r\nA Well, funnily enough I can!
