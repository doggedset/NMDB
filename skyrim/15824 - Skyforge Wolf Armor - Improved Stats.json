  "summary": "Wolf Armor with moderately improved statistics to reflect the fact it&#39;s meant to be Skyforge Steel.",
  "descriptionHtml": "==========\r<br />Introduction\r<br />==========\r<br />It always bugged me that while the Skyforge Steel weapons are the same weight as normal Steel, but do better damage, the Wolf Armor made at the same forge has the same defense as Steel, but weighs less. Where is the logic in that? How about some consistency?\r<br />\r<br />This small mod aims to address this issue.\r<br />\r<br />As of version 2.0, there are eight versions of this mod, providing compatibility with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34093/?]Weapons & Armor Fixes Remade[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24909/?]aMidianBorn Book of Silence[/url]--both with and without the Content Addon--and invisible helmet versions of each.\r<br />\r<br />You should only install ONE esp.\r<br />\r<br />==========\r<br />Stats, etc\r<br />==========\r<br />For version 2.0, I&#39;ve rebalanced the original stats slightly. Essentially, Wolf Armor weighs much the same as Steel now, while it gives a bit more defense. I&#39;ve weighed Wolf Armor in between Steel and Steel Plate, to match the kind of body coverage it provides. That makes it weigh considerably more: a total of 55.5 instead of 32.\r<br />\r<br />That is offset by a moderately higher defense than Steel Plate, actually falling in the range of Orcish and Carved Nordic. For comparison, here are the base numbers (always below what you see in game):\r<br />\r<br />Armor:\r<br />- Steel / Wolf: 31\r<br />- Steel Plate: 40\r<br />- Orcish: 40\r<br />- Skyforge Wolf: 41\r<br />- Carved Nordic: 43\r<br />- Ebony: 43\r<br />\r<br />Helm:\r<br />- Steel / Wolf: 17\r<br />- Steel Plate : 19\r<br />- Orcish: 20\r<br />- Skyforge Wolf: 20\r<br />- Carved Nordic: 20\r<br />- Ebony: 21\r<br />\r<br />Boots / Gauntlets:\r<br />- Steel / Wolf: 12\r<br />- Steel Plate: 14\r<br />- Orcish: 15\r<br />- Skyforge Wolf: 15\r<br />- Carved Nordic: 15\r<br />- Ebony: 16\r<br />\r<br />Shield (if using aMidianBorn):\r<br />- Steel: 24\r<br />- Steel Plate: n/a\r<br />- Orcish: 30\r<br />- Skyforge Wolf: 30\r<br />- Carved Nordic: 26.5\r<br />- Ebony: 32\r<br />\r<br />If that seems like a big jump (from 31 to 41 on the body armor, for example), I would argue that the Wolf Armor, judging by its body coverage and design, would be somewhere between Steel and Steel Plate Armor if it was made anywhere other than the Skyforge. Both the Steel Plate and Wolf Armor, for example, contain a full chest plate, while standard Steel Armor does not. If non-Skyforge Wolf Armor were between Steel and Steel Plate, it would probably have a rating of about 35  or 36. And then the jump to 41 is not as large.\r<br />\r<br />In the end, I feel these stats suit the &#39;lore&#39; better than the original ones. The Skyforge is meant to create excellent weapons and armor. It should be (arguably) the best steel in the world. It&#39;s still steel though, and isn&#39;t going to be better than dragonbone. But I don&#39;t really see why a legendary forge should produce such terrible armor.\r<br />\r<br />(In version 1.0, I placed these values slightly higher, as for some reason I thought that Ebony provided higher values than that. Version 2.0 reduces the value slightly, placing Wolf Armor at approximately the same point as Carved Nordic--a couple of points lower if you&#39;re not using a shield, or higher if you are--and 0.5 lighter.)\r<br />\r<br />This leads to the following total armor values:\r<br />\r<br />Without Shield:\r<br />- Steel / Wolf: 72\r<br />- Steel Plate: 87\r<br />- Orcish: 90\r<br />- Skyforge Wolf: 91\r<br />- Carved Nordic: 93\r<br />- Ebony: 96\r<br />\r<br />With Shield:\r<br />- Steel / Wolf: 96, or 102 with the Shield of Ysgramor\r<br />- Steel Plate: 87 + shield\r<br />- Orcish: 120\r<br />- Skyforge Wolf: 121\r<br />- Carved Nordic: 119.5\r<br />- Ebony: 128\r<br />\r<br />Version 2.0 also increases the cost of these items, matching the prices used in Weapons & Armor Fixes Remade, and provides compatibility with the Wolf Shield added by aMidianBorn Book of Silence\r<br />\r<br />==========\r<br />Balance\r<br />==========\r<br />Indeed, the only reason I can see for vanilla Wolf Armor to be so weak (and light) is balance. You can pick up a set of Wolf Armor fairly early in the game, and long before Orcish (unless you do some serious grinding and get lucky with vendors). Using Skyforge Wolf Armor at that point will clearly give you an advantage. If that&#39;s an issue for you, I&#39;d recommend only installing this mod when you naturally acquire Orcish Smithing.\r<br />\r<br />As I hope I&#39;ve made clear above, I have tried to make the stat adjustments as lore-friendly as possible. Wolf Armor is a good version of Steel Armor, essentially. It is not meant to be comparable to Dragonbone or Daedric, and I have no plans to add stronger versions with those values. Quite aside from the lore, it isn&#39;t really necessary. To reach the armor cap of 567 requires a base armor value of 85; vanilla Wolf Armor has 72, while my adjusted version has 91. In other words, by maxing out your Heavy Armor and Smithing skills, this mod allows you to reach the armor cap with Wolf Armor. If you&#39;re using the Wolf shield added by Book of Silence, it&#39;s even easier.\r<br />\r<br />==========\r<br />Compatibility\r<br />==========\r<br />Because this mod only alters statistics it should be compatible with everything which does not also alter those statistics. For most purposes, the standard vanilla version should be all you need.\r<br />\r<br />Version 2.0 adds compatibility with Weapons & Armor Fixes Remade and aMidianBorn Book of Silence. If you&#39;re using those (excellent) mods, download the esp which fits your set up, and make sure this mod loads after the ones you have installed. If you&#39;re using the aMidianBorn Content Addon, that means both the default brown set and the additional grey set will use the improved stats from this mod.\r<br />\r<br />I would have liked to create a smart installer in the vein of my Khajiit Speak mod, but it seems that the &#39;&&#39; symbol causes problems for NMM.\r<br />\r<br />==========\r<br />Invisible Helmet\r<br />==========\r<br />I have included an alternate &#39;invisible helmet&#39; version of each of the esps. Using this version will render the helmet invisible when you wear it (shock&#33; horror&#33; bet you didn&#39;t see that coming&#33;). Basically, it forces the helmet to occupy the Circlet slot only, rather than both the Circlet and Hair slots. It will still provide armor value and exposure protection if you are using Frostfall. \r<br />\r<br />==========\r<br />My Other Mods\r<br />==========\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14513/]Khajiit Speak - Complete Dialogue Overhaul [/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31985/]Cultural Diversity[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14430/]Improved Race Descriptions[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16231/]Reduced Gold Rewards for Quests[/url]",
