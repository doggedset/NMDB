  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;ve seen that Lydia becomes a little weak when we get strong, this is because she doesn&#39;t level up like we do, so I&#39;ve created this mod mainly for this, but later decided that a change in her appearance would do just fine, so this mod contains:\r<br />\r<br />Level-up system:\r<br />She will always have the level as the hero.\r<br />\r<br />Perk System:\r<br />She is mainly a defender, so her shield and heavy armor perks will be her mainly perks.\r<br />\r<br />Appearance:\r<br />Look at the images&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Essential NPC:\r<br />She&#39;ll not die anymore, will just go to the ground and stay there for a moment.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />Install this via NMM or put the contents on your Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If you like, endorse, if don&#39;t, just pass in silence, but all the critics will be pondered, they&#39;re necessary to a greater work.\r<br />\r<br />Anyone that is willing to have another NPCs remodeled, just PM me, I&#39;ll be happy to help where I could.",
