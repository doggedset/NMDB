Unfortunately there was quite a large gap in the light weaponry tree when using Tanto&#39;s, Wakizashi&#39;s, and Katana&#39;s (and in the Heavy Tree Nodachi&#39;s) with the left side of the smithing branch.  You were with forced to either loot/buy a Daedric quality weapon, grab all the heavy (right-side) smithing perks to forge a Daedric one, or concede to Silver quality weapons in the middle.  \r<br />\r<br />This mod fills out many of the missing gaps in materials using a combined set of models and textures from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12892/]Weapons of the 3rd Era MoS Edition[/url] and [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10171/]Wulfharths Dragonbone Weapons[/url] all pre-balanced and fully-integrated for Skyyim Redone.  The complete list of weapons included in this pack follows:\r<br />\r<br />* Elven Tanto\r<br />* Elven Wakizashi\r<br />* Elven Katana\r<br />* Elven Nodachi\r<br />* Glass Tanto\r<br />* Glass Wakizashi\r<br />* Glass Katana\r<br />* Glass Nodachi\r<br />* Ebony Tanto\r<br />* Ebony Wakizashi\r<br />* Ebony Katana\r<br />* Ebony Nodachi\r<br />* Dragonbone Tanto\r<br />* Dragonbone Wakizashi (Special note: this was created by scaling the Katana in Nifskope)\r<br />* Dragonbone Katana\r<br />* Dragonbone Nodachi\r<br />* Dragonbone Shortsword\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve also edited some of the leveled lists in SkyRe so some of these weapons should pop up in the SkyRe universe.\r<br />\r<br />[color=yellow]Closing Thoughts[/color]\r<br />This is a pretty simple mod, I created it since it wasn&#39;t very clean to install the entirety of Weapons of the 3rd Era MoS Edition and Wulfharths Dragonbone Weapons.  It created a lot of crafting clutter and duplicate recipes which my slightly anal-retentive self has issues with.  I also found it quite easy to make a Dragonbone Wakizashi by scaling Wulfharths Katana model down which kept the lists tidy, and also straight up adding the Dragonbone Shortsword as well by him to SkyRe.  \r<br />\r<br />I am NOT a model creator though so all credit must be given to masterofshadows and Wulfharth for this plugin.  I&#39;d love to also expand this plugin to fill out more of the missing gaps in SkyRe; things like Scimitar&#39;s, Spears, Mauls, etc. but it beyond my abilities to create them.  If you have any suggestions of other mods that might work and can put me in contact with their mod authors I&#39;d be happy to think about adding them to this pack.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks&#33;",
