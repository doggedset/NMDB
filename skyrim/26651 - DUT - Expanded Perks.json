  "summary": "Additional ranks for a number of perks that could use a bit of an extra \\\"kick\\\", either to bring them more up to par with other perks, or to allow more specialized \\\"flavor\\\" character builds -- changes or replacements to just a few other perks that felt too... \\\"lacking\\\"",
  "descriptionHtml": "[CENTER][SIZE=6][B]Dark Uncle\\'s Tweaks -- Expanded Perks[/B][/SIZE][/CENTER]\r\n  \r\n[center][url=http://www.skyrimgems.com][img]http://i.imgur.com/1wXSO.png[/img][/url][/center]\r\n \r\n[SIZE=4][COLOR=#ff0000][B]What this mod is:[/B][/COLOR][/SIZE]\r\nMostly an expansion of the perks already in the vanilla game, providing some additional/different specialization paths for more flavorful character building. In some cases it also reworks some perks that in my opinion are either so poorly designed as to be effectively \\\"broken\\\", or else just so uninteresting as to never really be worthwhile.\r\n \r\nAt the most basic level however, this is less an \\\"overhaul\\\" - and more just an expansion of what is already in the vanilla game.\r\n \r\nAlso this mod is designed to give users a fair amount of control over what changes they do or do not want to use. I have never been one for \\\"bigger is better\\\"... I\\'m more of a \\\"less is more\\\" kind of developer, and my mods usually reflect that -- thus I won\\'t be adding huge numbers of perks just for the purpose of adding perks, or other dynamics changes just because I can.\r\n \r\nIt is also worth noting that while I have tried to keep game balance in mind while designing this mod, I do not consider it to be particularly balanced - not am I interested in putting huge amount of effort into making it as balanced as possible. Overall I would suggest using this mod with higher difficult settings and/or mods that add difficulty to the game... but achieving game balance is a highly personal thing in my opinion: I\\'d rather see folks mix and match mods and settings to find the right balance for them, then break my own back trying to find a balance that pleases everybody.\r\n\r\n[B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#ff0000]IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THIS MOD:[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]\r\nThe changes made by this mod incorporate changes from the Unofficial Skyrim Patch, and the Unofficial Dawnguard Patch mods wherever necessary to insure compatability when loading my mods after those two --- in other words, loading this mod after those two will maintain their changes, except where they specifically clash with the purpose of this mod. This does not mean that these mods are required, just that they are fully compatible. It also means that if you run this mod without either of those two mods, you\\'ll get a few other minor changes that are not otherwise documented here (all of them minor, and unquestionable \\\"fixes\\\" to Bethesda\\'s mistakes).\r\n \r\n[B][SIZE=4][COLOR=#ff0000]Required mods:[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]\r\n[LIST]\r\n[*]Dawnguard DLC\r\n[*][URL=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1175]Skyrim
