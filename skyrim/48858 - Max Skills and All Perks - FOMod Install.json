  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://imageshack.com/a/img834/8293/64cn.png[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />I have [b][u][i]FINALLY[/i][/u][/b] fixed the XX issue so you no longer need to edit the files. The fix is based on the fact that you chose Dawnguard dlc&#39;s position in the load order in the installer. This way you can easily install the version of the file that will work for you. More details is in the installer.\r<br />\r<br />With this .bat file you gain access to all Skills and all Perks with one command. To get this file just download with NMM and follow the FOMod Install.\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://imageshack.com/a/img834/6409/k9ss.png[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />Just launch the game and press ~ and then just type [i] bat skillperk [/i] and you&#39;re done. You now have [b]ALL[/b] perks and [b]MAX[/b] Skills. You can gain x amount of levels with this file. Just make all the skills [i]Legendary[/i] after you used this file and just repeat the process all over again to gain infinite levles.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE : The Werewolf and Vampire part require Dawnguard to be installed and and you must have joined either the Vampires or the Dawnguard. Otherwise, no effect.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00B3B3][size=4]Please [i][u][b]ENDORSE[/b][/u][/i] this mod if you liked it or found it helpful :-)[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />NOTE:\r<br />\r<br />If you want the skill interface screen look like mine, you need this mod: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/7308/?] Skill Interface Retexture [/url]",
