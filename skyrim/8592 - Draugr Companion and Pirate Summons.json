Calixto&#39;s House of Curiosities in Windhelm has a few more books, one of which will summon a Pirate fighter. The fighter will last a few days before he leaves again ( or if he is defeated).\r<br />\r<br />This is very much a work in progress. In the final version I will add some back story quests and custom  voice over.\r<br />\r<br />When you tell Jarl Winter to leave he will return to Whiterun.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33;",
