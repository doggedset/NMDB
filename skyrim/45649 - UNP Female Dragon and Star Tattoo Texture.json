It should work just fine for other UNP body variants as well!  Its Simplistic and not overcrowded like so many, yet it still has lots of body coverage.  It flows smoothly; treating the body like a canvass as opposed to just stamping tattoos in random areas.  It is sexy but not overly sexualized like so many mods here on the nexus.\r\n\r\nI hope you Enjoy!\r\n\r\n[center][heading][b] Download and Installation [/b][/heading][/center]\r\n[b][u]First we need to download all required files which include UNP and my new texture![/u][/b]\r\n\r\n[b] [1] [/b] Download and install [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709/?] Dimonized UNP Female Body[/url] \r\n[b] [2] [/b] Download my mod with NMM or manually\r\n\r\n[b][u] Next we backup our original texture so if we want to delete the mod later we still have it[/u][/b]\r\n\r\n[b] [3] [/b] Go into your Skyrim install directory usually (Steam\\\\Steamapps\\\\Common\\\\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim) from there navigate to (Data\\\\Textures\\\\Actors\\\\Character\\\\Female) and fine the file called (Femalebody_1.dds) rename that file to something like (Femalebody_1BAK.dds) or whatever you will remember later on!\r\n\r\n[b][u] Lastly we install the mod and overwright when necissary [/u][/b]\r\n\r\n[b] [4] [/b] Double Click in Nexus Mod Manager and say yes to overwright\r\n\r\n[b]......OR MANUALLY......[/b]\r\n\r\n[b] [4] [/b] Unrar the rar file and drag the data folder into:\r\n(Steam\\\\Steamapps\\\\Common\\\\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim)\r\nand over wright any files!\r\n\r\n[b] [5] [/b] DONE!
