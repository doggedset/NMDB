  "descriptionHtml": "This is a small, novelty mod I made for myself that adds Pamun, the first character I ever made in the game, as a follower. You can find him in the Bannered Mare in Whiterun. This mod only uses assets found in the vanilla game, so it doesn&#39;t require any DLCs and will be affected by any follower-tweaking mods you install.",
