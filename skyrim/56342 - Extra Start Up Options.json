  "descriptionHtml": "Starting a new game can be extremely tedious. This mod offers a few helpful options in a small menu that opens after character creation. Everything is completely optional so feel free to download even if you only like one feature. The others will not bother you again after character creation.\r<br />\r<br />The options are:\r<br />\r<br />[b]Reassign Stats[/b] – Offers two options: Racial Only or All.\r<br />\r<br />If you select Racial Only, your skills will be set to 15 and you will be able to choose 1 skill to add +10 to and five skills to add +5 to. In other words you will end up with the same distribution as all vanilla races.\r<br />\r<br />If you select All, you will have a few more options. Your skills will be set to 5 and you may then choose:\r<br />\r<br />1 Area of Expertise (Warrior, Mage, Thief): +5 to all.\r<br />1 Primary Skill: +25\r<br />5 Major Skills: +20\r<br />6 Minor Skills: +10\r<br />\r<br />At the end of this process you will have the same number of total skill points as in the vanilla game, but one skill may be as high as 35 and some may be as low as 5 (depending on your choices).\r<br />\r<br />[b]Choose a Birthsign[/b] – Allows you to choose one of the vanilla Standing Stone boons to start the game. Selecting another boon from a new Standing Stone will replace the one you start with.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Get Some Gear[/b] – Opens a chest with extremely basic starting gear. Hide and iron armor, one of each weapon, novice spells, a few minor potions, a few basic crafting items, five soul gems and ten lockpicks.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Appearance Changer[/b] – MCM menu. Toggle the option to gain a spell that will allow you to change your appearance. Turn the option off again to clean up your spell book. Because it shouldn&#39;t cost 1000 gp to get a haircut.",
