  "descriptionHtml": "Test file of remeshed Falmer boots to fit artifex0\\\\\\'s Argonian Raptor Feet mod.  They are playable and can be found in the Whiterun Guardhouse.  \r\n\r\nI believe the normal maps are not displaying correctly so the textures look flat.  I am just learning how to mod for Skyrim and have been looking at tutorials and troubleshooting posts but cannot fix the texture/normal/shader issue.  Somebody please help!  If I figure out what\\\\\\'s wrong I will soon be making Footwraps and Helmets that display horns hopefully.\r\n\r\nEdit: Sorry my mistake - what I thought were flat textures due to a normal map display issue due to an error in Nifskope are actually the default in-game Falmer textures lol - they are really atrocious because the front face of the Bethesda boot mesh is completely flat and made up of like two polygons vertically split lengthwise down the middle - meaning it\\'s impossible to make these boots not look flat on the front.  Will be working on an alternate mesh soon.",
