  "modName": "House of Clan Dragon-Tongue",
  "summary": "A player home with four other characters, including two marriageable characters, and a follower. One character has been referenced in my previous mod, and makes an appearance here. The house is located in the wilderness, and replaces a spot where some useless rocks once were.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Clan Dragon-Tongue lives in the wilderness, where they have a spare bedroom, for your character. Whether you are a Dragon-Tongue, traveller who has stayed for a while, or someone they found dying and nursed back to health... This place is for you. Of course, there are more possibilities than those listed, but that matters not.\r<br />\r<br />One who has read Thalmor Dossier: Hjoric Dragon-Tongue, which appeared in my other mod, Cloud Ruler Manor (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53202/?tab=1&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D53202%26preview%3D&pUp=1) may wonder why he does not appear as he is referenced. This is clearly for roleplaying purposes, with several possibilities to include. For example...\r<br />\r<br />- He may not be that Hjoric Dragon-Tongue,\r<br />\r<br />- He may have planted evidence on another with that description, leading the Thalmor to believe that the framed person is Hjoric.\r<br />\r<br />- Did Aeritis or Brylica (also from Cloud Ruler Manor) plant the evidence for him, in more recent times as he is old?\r<br />\r<br />As you can tell, there are so many possibilities, and those listed are but a few.\r<br />\r<br />This time, there are no new books or weapons, but there is a follower, and two spouses. The follower is actually one of these spouses, really.\r<br />\r<br />For the mods that I am creating, this is but the second. They will all link together, in one way or another. Some more than others, but the fact they link makes it rather interesting to me.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Edit: The file with unfinished details is exactly the same as the other, but was added accidentally, and before. Only take one, as they are exactly the same in-game. ",
