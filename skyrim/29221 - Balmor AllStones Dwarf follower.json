  "descriptionHtml": "Balmor is in the market place of Riften fresh in from hunting all over Tamriel. He\\'s a tough two handed Berzerker as all Dwarfs are & heavy armor specialist. Not two bad a archer either as he is an accomplished hunter. He is a stand alone character and does not replace any Vanilla characters. SOOO if your looking for a butt kicking sidekick with a mean streak, bad breath and a unhealthy affection for ale, instead of a pin up barbie in her undies....here\\'s your dwarf!",
