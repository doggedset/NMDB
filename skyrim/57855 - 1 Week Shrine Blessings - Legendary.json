  "summary": "Extends all shrine blessings (including Auri-El&#39;s blessing and the daedric blessings) to 1 week of duration. Requires Dawnguard and Dragonborn.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Just a little convenience mod that extends blessings from shrines from 8 hours to 168 hours (one week).Â  Includes the Auri-El shrine from Dawnguard and the Azura, Boethia, and Mephala shrines from Dragonborn.\r<br />\r<br />This version of the mod requires both the Dawnguard and Dragonborn DLC. Other mods exist that provide a similar effect just for vanilla shrines, I made this one myself as a convenience for those who needed an all-DLC Legendary edition.\r<br />\r<br />Permissions\r<br />========\r<br />Do anything you feel like with it, with or without crediting me.",
