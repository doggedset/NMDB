  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=5][b]\"Our arrows will blot out the sun!\"[/b][/size][/center]\r\n[center][size=5][b]\"Then we will fight in the shade.\"[/b][/size][/center]\r\n[center][youtube]qvx7oXqiaMM[/youtube][/center]\r\n\r\nI was disappointed with vanilla Dawnguard's bloodcursed eclipse effect. It was supposed to make the day \"as dark as night\", as the NPCs put it. Except it didn't. Now it is, perhaps even [i]darker[/i] than night. It's quite a bit darker than usual, and it takes some getting used to, but I personally think it makes the effect that much more immersive.\r\n\r\n[b]Note:[/b] The lighting mods you have may affect the degree of darkness, etc. experienced. For example, in my screenshots, I have [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17802]Climates of Tamriel[/url], [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27043]ELFX[/url], and [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30936]RealVision ENB[/url]. The latter tends to make darker environments much darker and brighter environments much brighter, so keep that in mind. \r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Requirements[/b][/size]\r\n[b]ENBs are [i]not[/i] required to use this mod[/b]; I only noted them in the screenshots since I use them, since results of other users may differ depending on what ENBs or other graphical mods they have installed. Also, I hate to be captain obvious here, but this mod requires Dawnguard, so if you don't have it, don't bother installing.\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Installation[/b][/size]\r\nAs for the installation process, it's only 1 ESP file. You can either manually extract it to your Skyrim/Data folder or use Nexus Mod Manager. I like to use the latter for simplicity, though.\r\nAdditionally, [b]if you have Realistic Lighting Overhaul, make sure to load this [i]after[/i] the Dawnguard module![/b]\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Changes in 1.1 and 1.2[/b][/size]\r\n - Slightly less dark sky\r\n - Sky now has a subtle orange-reddish tint towards the horizon, staying true to the vanilla eclipse sky effects\r\n - Added a more reddish glare to the bloodcursed eclipse\r\n - You do not have to upgrade if you like the old effects better\r\n\r\n[size=5][b]Future Plans[/b][/size]\r\n - Allow for varying degrees of darkness for the effect\r\n - Add night sky effects - stars, auroras, etc - during the duration of a bloodcursed eclipse\r\n\r\n[b]Like this mod? Please endorse![/b] It may not seem like much, but it shows that you like this mod, which encourages me to continue modding.",
