INFORMATION ON THE MOD           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   This mod adds more quests to the College of Winterhold.\r\n\r\n\t   To start the new quests, join the College of Winterhold and speak to Ajira in the Hall\r\nof Countenance living quarters of the college.  You can do these quests before, during, or after \r\nthe main questline of the college.\r\n\r\n\t   These quests are inspired by (directly ripped off from) the Mages Guild quests in \r\nMorrowind. \r\n\r\n\t   This mod uses voiced dialog.\r\n\r\n\t   Morrowind did not have quest markers and it did just fine without them.  So this mod \r\ndoes not use quest markers either.\r\n\r\n\t   At this point, the mod just adds two new quests.\r\n\r\n\t   If you thought that the College of Winterhold quests were a bit disappointing because \r\nthey were too short and did not add enough hours of play time to the game, then this mod could \r\nhelp a bit.\t    \r\n************************************************************************\r\n2. Installation                           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n           Extract (decompress) the .esp and the .bsa to your Skyrim directory.  \r\n(It will be something like *Installation directory*\\\\Skyrim\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data)\r\nMark the box next to \\\"Wild Goose Chase Quest.esp\\\" in your mod manager.\r\n \r\n           Alternately, extract files someplace else.  Then move the .esp and .bsa \r\nto Skyrim\\\\Data.  Mark the box next to the plugin in your mod manager.\r\n************************************************************************\r\n3. Version History    \r\n************************************************************************\r\nV 0.5    5/20/12   Initial release.   \r\n************************************************************************\r\n4. Conflicts, Known Issues, and Troubleshooting\r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   Since this mod does not use any meshes, textures, or sounds from Morrowind, it is not\r\nexpected that it will be pulled down because of piracy accusations.\r\n\r\n\t   If you aren\\'t smart enough to be able to read diary entries and complete quests that have\r\nno quest objective markers, then you aren\\'t smart enough to play this mod.  We are sorry.  There is\r\nnothing we can do about your intelligence level.  Maybe you could drink a potion or something.\r\n\r\n\t   You say this mod is not lore friendly?  Lore friendly?  What is that?\r\n\r\n\t   Some of the screen shots show soul gems from a savegame using the mod \\\"Morrowind-Colored \r\nSoul Gems\\\"   http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9033\r\n     \r\n\t   This mod probably needs more play-testing.\r\n\r\n\t   If you locate a bug in this mod, contact David Brasher of Freddy the Noob\\'s Mod Team\r\non TES Nexus so that the issue can be examined and hopefully fixed.\t   \r\n************************************************************************\r\n5.
