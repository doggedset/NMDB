  "descriptionHtml": "Well I am lucky I am not good at writing descriptions cause a mod like this doesnt really need one. look at the screenshots :P.\r\n\r\nInstall it by extracting everything to skyrim folder (where the exe file is)\r\n\r\nGo to skyrim.prefs in my documents/games/skyrim and change  bFloatPointRenderTarget=0 to  bFloatPointRenderTarget=1.\r\n\r\nAnd thats it. Then you can enjoy your sexy skyrim. What really does it for me is how realistic the grass/plants look. \r\n\r\nCredits to Boris and his fantastical enb. Couldnt make this without it. \r\nMods that make this sexy: Flora Overhaul, HD 2k Skyrim\r\n\r\nSidenote: Sorry if i left something out in the credits or files D: please dont delete the mod just tell me what to add.",
