  "summary": "Married NPCs in the player home will every so often walk up to the chest to change to one of multiple player-created outfits of clothes or armor.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Update 2 - now v2.1, Debug messages removed and default faction is now &#34;Player Married&#34;.\r<br />Update - now v2.0, can be setup once in any player home, stock or downloaded.\r<br />\r<br />What the mod does\r<br />===================\r<br />Married NPCs who are temporarily or permanently located in the selected player home, will every so often walk upstairs to the Chest to change to a randomly picked outfit of clothes or armor.\r<br />\r<br />The sets of outfits (not the same as CK outfits) can be setup in-game beforehand:\r<br />\r<br />eg boots #1, pants #1, top #1\r<br />   boots #2, pants #1, top #2\r<br />\r<br />It will work with any 3rd party clothing/armors. Any outfits previously added to an NPC will get removed when they next change. While in-game, you can wipe the outfits setup so far, and start again. Clothing change interval can be set from 10 seconds to multiple in-game hours. Changes will still occur while the player is travelling around Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />The Chest can be setup once, either in a stock Skyrim home (Hearthfire, anything) or a downloaded on.\r<br />\r<br />Versions\r<br />===================\r<br />=2.0= Massive code cleanup, removed all house-specific items and code. Mod can now be enabled in any player home.\r<br />=1.1= Whiterun file modified to allow for better support of multiple houses & languages. Riften, Markarth, Solitude and Windhelm files uploaded. Outfit count and change cycles missed/succeeded are now listed in the book in the chest.\r<br />=1.0= Initial version for Whiterun.\r<br />\r<br />Usage\r<br />===================\r<br />The mod will locate actors in the player home who the player has married. Predominantly this is aimed at those installed with the Pimp House mod. But you could also marry someone via the Temple of Mara.\r<br />\r<br />To get started:\r<br />- Read the two spells (Chest Selector and Config, they will have been added)\r<br />- Cast the Chest Selector spell\r<br />- Open a Chest within 10 seconds\r<br />- Wait for notification of scripts coming online&#33; &lt;- Note if chest opens before this, close and wait&#33;\r<br />- Add clothing in sets to the chest\r<br />- Close the chest to confirm\r<br />And you&#39;re setup.\r<br />\r<br />To create an outfit, open the chest, and add any clothes/armor, then close the chest and an outfit will have been created. Preferably don&#39;t use AddItem via console directly. No issues with player.additem and then dropping them in.\r<br />\r<br />To alter the period between each clothing change, use the menu to setup either Seconds or Game Hours. Default time is 30 seconds.\r<br />\r<br />To have your spouse occasionally go nude, change the percentage of the time in the config menu spell.\r<br />\r<br />To wipe any listed outfits and start again, use the config menu. The mod will still remember any clothes added to actors and delete them as the actors go to change again.\r<br />\r<br />Once in a while the NPC randomizer will get stuck, in this case use the config menu to reset it. Outfits setup previously will not be lost.\r<br />\r<br />There is a book in the chest describing all this if you forget in-game&#33; It will list the cycles missed/succeeded, and also the count of Outfits. It does take a couple of seconds to update the numbers, and updates will stop if removed from the chest (new book will be created if it&#39;s accidentally taken out).\r<br />\r<br />By default the chest will look for &#34;Player Married&#34; NPCs or &#34;Potential Marriage&#34; NPCs, but this can be configured to either or both.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Bugs\r<br />===================\r<br />The outfit array will sometimes enter in an additional blank value if the first outfit entered contains multiple pieces. Meaning if 9 outfits are present, the randomizer will pick from a total of 10, and if picked the NPC will end up nude.\r<br />\r<br />Limits\r<br />===================\r<br />Chest can assign up to 200 individual items into outfits.\r<br />Can remember 200 items that have been added to NPCs for later deletion.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Notes\r<br />===================\r<br />Papyrus is a fairly basic scripting language, which means a lot of things need to be done via workarounds. I&#39;d hoped to build something 100% robust and simple and then go onto harder scripting with the more detailed functions. But there aren&#39;t a great deal of functions that give greater game control. This is held together with a LOT of workarounds, so hopefully it works ok.\r<br />\r<br />When I refer to &#39;Outfits&#39; above, I mean the ones created by this script in arrays, not the CK Outfits assigned to Actors. There&#39;s unfortunately very little in papyrus to work with those.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve left on message notifications for when a Randomizer reset is triggered, or when the outfits are wiped. I think I&#39;ve turned all the other ones off, but let me know if any strange ones are still going.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Mods used in screenshots (none needed for this mod)\r<br />===================\r<br />Pimp House http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7291\r<br />Breezehome Extra Light http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15693\r<br />\r<br />Layer Bikini http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7736\r<br />Border Lingerie http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14431\r<br />Pushup Bikini http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11764\r<br />Astaroth Suit http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14221\r<br />Branwen Armor http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14340\r<br />Gatti Bondage http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12651\r<br />Dark Wind Armor http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15372",
