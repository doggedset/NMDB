  "modName": "Darker Skyrim Dungeons",
  "summary": "This mod darkens most dungeons in Skyrim. It gives purpose to use those torches and light spells we all have ;)",
  "descriptionHtml": "The mod specifically edits the  \\'light templates\\' of these dungeons. \r\n\r\nThings to keep in mind:\r\nUndead will still be able to see you.\r\nFalmer will still be able to detect you.\r\nDwemer machines will still be able to detect you.\r\nLight will likely attract unwanted attention in dark dungeons.\r\nCarry torches or keep your light spells handy, it is dark.\r\n\r\nThis addon works very well with Sounds of Skyrim. Also check out the \\'Lightless Abandon Dungeons\\' Mod for an even Darker experience. Also See \\'Rings of Light Enchantment\\' mod to light up those dark dungeons. Ill be working on craftable torches and such and possible lanterns. \r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\nThere was some popping issues before, but all should be fixed with this release. I will read my comments and continue to work on it ;)",
