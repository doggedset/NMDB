This Dovahkiin was also a very powerful mage, with a particular interest in enchanting. Thus, after having mastered the craft, he created this shield, which protects the wielder from all forms of Dragon Breath Attack, such that all he needed to worry about was the Dragon&#39;s teeth from that point on.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Basically, this shield makes the user immune to dragon breath shouts, such as fire and ice, so you can feel like the real Dovahkiin badass that you are&#33; :D\r<br />\r<br />The shield is located in the chest near the first dragon word wall you encounter, in Bleak Falls Barrow.\r<br />\r<br />From testing the mod, it seems that, to get the full effects (no health loss at all) you must block before the dragon shouts, and continue blocking until after the character fire-effects have worn off. Otherwise, you hear the pain and get a minor health loss, which instantly regenerates.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Feel free to PM me with any questions about the mod, including reporting bugs etc :D",
