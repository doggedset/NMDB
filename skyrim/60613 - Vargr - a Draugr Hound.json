The idea came to me when I lamented on the boredom of Skyrim&#39;s crypts. So figured that some variety to the enemies encountered among the draugr. You can encounter a few of these draugr hounds in every nordic crypt. A few of them are assigned to Â special factions. Haven&#39;t done extensive beta-testing, other than that I know the creature itself should work fine. Cleaned with TES5EDIT.\r<br />You can use this freely in your own mods. No need to credit either, but you can if you want to be nice.",
