  "modName": "Wuuthrad Jorrvaskr Display",
  "summary": "Adds the ability to display Wuuthrad and a shield in Jorrvaskr. 1st submitted mod, however I&#39;ve been modding for myself since Oblivion. Too chicken to submit anything.",
  "descriptionHtml": "WARNING UPDATE: Wuuthrad is a rather peculiar weapon. Apparently when the cell resets it gets its weight back and can drop to the ground or in some cases disappear. On pc you can go to the console (~ key), tilde I believe it&#39;s called and type: player.additem 956B5 1 and this will place it in your inventory. I don&#39;t know how Xbox/PS works in this regard.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Possible spoilers if you haven&#39;t finished Companions quest. This is a simple mod that adds a display for Wuuthrad when you complete the Companion&#39;s quests. Also adds an additional display next to it for a &#34;particular&#34; shield. There&#39;s no scripting involved, as it&#39;s just a weapon and shield rack added in Jorrvaskr. \r<br />\r<br />No exterior cells altered. Only interior cell altered is Jorrvaskr. No navmesh touched. No vanilla items touched. \r<br />\r<br />Should work with any mod as long as they don&#39;t modify the wall by the stairs where the fragments of Wuuthrad are. \r<br />\r<br />You can basically place any weapon and shield on them at any time. But for me, they are waiting for two specific items. \r<br />\r<br />You can place them and display them and retrieved them too.\r<br />\r<br />Suggestions and comments welcome.\r<br />\r<br />Included ESP only. Drop in your Skyrim data folder.",
