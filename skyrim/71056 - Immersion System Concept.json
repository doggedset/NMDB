  "summary": "A concept mod that aims to create a workable prototype of better event probability in Skyrim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The complete Immersion System should seek to incorporate 4 parts namely:\r<br />1. Karma system\r<br />2. Reputation system\r<br />3. Consequence system\r<br />\r<br />Each of these separate parts are combined to create a system which is able to introduce more realistic event probability in Skyrim. As you play Skyrim, events start to become predictable and your sense of immersion diminishes. Events like those predictable Thug or Assassin encounters.\r<br />\r<br />1. KarmaÂ \r<br />-This aims to deal with more random events that CAN occur to the player. If the player just did a crime, then the Karma system would implement a chance for an unfavorable event to happen to the player.\r<br />-It can include karma for NPCs, but that would require a lot more work than if it only involves the player.\r<br />\r<br />2. Reputation\r<br />- This aims to track reputation with factions so that it doesn&#39;t just seem like everyone&#39;s just forgotten that you did that certain crime in the past.\r<br />- Likewise, the player can gain favor with factions.\r<br />\r<br />3. Consequence\r<br />- This can be viewed as cause and effect. The main cause and effect situation in Skyrim would have to be how crimes are handled during your play through.",
