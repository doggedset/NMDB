  "summary": "I made this mod because the similar ones i have found are not compatible with marriage/adoption mods. This one is.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Not much to say, really.\r<br />I only found similar mods that alter the same scripts that multiple marriage or adopting mods do,Â so they are incompatible. This one is fully compatible with marriage/adoption mods, as it does not modify or add any scripts or quests, it only affects bards, and only the ones who sing in taverns. Install it and enjoy the silence. Or the ambient music. I changed the vanilla music and its annoying when a bard starts to play, so now i can listen to it, or ambient sounds. You can still ask them to play, though.\r<br />\r<br />Keep in mind that this mod only affects the bards in the vanilla taverns. If you have mods that add bards, it will still work but for those newly added you need a compatibility patch. Tell me and I will ask the author for permission to do so. For that reason, Im working in a patch for interesting npcs.",
