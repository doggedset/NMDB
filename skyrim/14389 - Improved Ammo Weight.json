  "descriptionHtml": "Arrows now have 0.1 inventory weight.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this mod, you should see Improved Armor Formula.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15860\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n1) Place Troy1010_ImprovedAmmoWeight into your data folder.\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\n1) Remove all arrows from your inventory\r\n2) Delete Troy1010_ImprovedAmmoWeight from your data folder.\r\n\r\nWHY I CREATED THIS MOD\r\nIn my version of skyrim, inventory management is a must. Because of another beta mod I created, players have severely reduced carryweight capacity. However, players may go over this cap at the gradual expense of their stamina regen and movement speed, to another cap. Again, that is my version of skyrim, nothing to do with the ImprovedAmmoWeight mod.\r\nI also intend to create a mod that allows stamina to play a much bigger role in combat.\r\n\r\nIn essense, I do not believe 1000 arrows weigh nothing, and since inventory weight is important in my version of skyrim..\r\nI need arrows to have weight. This mod makes that happen.\r\n\r\nHOW THIS MOD WORKS:\r\nIt is simply a script that\r\n1) Counts the number of arrows in your inventory. It only knows about arrows types that are in the formlist I created for my own arrows. So if you have more arrows from different mods, it will ignore them.\r\n2) After it counts your arrows, it will make you have the same number of a certain invisible item, which each have 0.1 weight.",
