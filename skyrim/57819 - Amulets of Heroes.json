  "summary": "Collect all eight of these mighty amulets and become the ultimate foe&#33;\r<br />And now in version 1.2, you can use these eight amulets to unlock the most powerful amulet of them all - The Hero&#39;s Amulet&#33; With a new feature never seen before (that I know of).",
  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#0000ff][size=6]NEW&#33;&#33;\r<br />[/size][/color][size=4]Version 1.2 - Adds another new amulet, the legendary Hero&#39;s Amulet, that can only be obtained after all the other eight are found&#33;\r<br />[size=3](full description coming)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation instructions for Version 1.2:[/b] If you don&#39;t have the previous version, then just install this normally via NMM or the mod manager of your choice. If youÂ DO have the previous version, don&#39;t uninstall it (or you&#39;ll lose all of your progress&#33;), and install V1.2 over the top of the last version (and it&#39;s update if you have that), and let it overwrite EVERYTHING. The esp, meshes, textures, everything. Hopefully this will work, ie prevent your progress in finding the amulets so far from being lost, but I can&#39;t guarantee it as I haven&#39;t, and can&#39;t, test it. If it doesn&#39;t, you can add them back into your inventory using the console.[/size]\r<br />[/size]\r<br />Scattered across Skyrim are eight legendary amulets, whose existance were thought only to be a myth, until now. However, nobody knows the locations of these rare treasures. So you&#39;ll have to find them&#33; Have fun :)\r<br />\r<br />Each amulet has a unique and powerful enchantment, but not too powerful be considered not lore-friendly (in my opinion). One can be found in each Hold (except Winterhold). Some can be found in interior cells, some in exterior cells. And that&#39;s all the clues you&#39;re getting :P\r<br />\r<br />Installation: Just install normally via NMM, or extract the esp, and the meshes and textures folders to your data folder, and merge the folders when prompted.\r<br />\r<br />Updating to Version 1.1: Don&#39;t uninstall version 1.0, just install the update over the top, and when asked to overwrite the esp choose &#39;yes&#39;. That way you&#39;ll still have the meshes and textures in v1.0 installed.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility: Should be no compatibility problems&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Hope you enjoy :)\r<br />\r<br />(Check the readme for spoilers of the enchantments on the amulets, and their locations)",
