IT WORKS FOR ME AND i HAVE NO PROBLEMS SO I GAVE TO THE COMMUNITY A FIX FOR A PROBLEM THAT NO ONE ELSE WOULD ADDRESS: THANKS FOR VISITING MY PAGE.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m no expert about these things and I&#39;ve searched all over the net for an answer to the problem, WeTriggerSript ERROR (................) Blah Blah..........\r<br /> \r<br />So here&#39;s what I did I looked all over the net and everyone says oh go look in C:UsersLoganSniperAppDataLocalSkyrimplugin.ini and check for double skyrim.esm listed there and remove one of them and then all will be good, NOT&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;. It wasn&#39;t there.\r<br /> \r<br />So then as a last ditch effort I searched for a script called What? That&#39;s right &#34;WETriggerScript.pex&#34;. Now the quick and dirty of it all is just a single edit to the script as Follows:\r<br /> \r<br />&#34;getMyHoldFactionControllerMarker ETX Off&#34; This is the default setting, but I set this to &#34;ON&#34; and then went in to the game and ran all over the place both in Solstheim and in Skyrim and never again did I get the error message.\r<br /> \r<br />Now the editor I used was Notpad ++ and this entry is found on line 2 of the editor about the middle of the line starting with &#34;OnCellLoad&#34;\r<br /> \r<br />I don&#39;t know if this is a cure all for this problem or not but it seems to be working really well for me right now so I hope this helps Someone or maybe gives someone that has more knowledge than I the means to finally put this beast to rest and fix this problem properly.\r<br />\r<br />Please Leave Feed Back Post On how this Worked For you or if you found something that works Better.",
