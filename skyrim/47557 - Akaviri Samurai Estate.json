  "summary": "This is a player home that attempts to have many asthetics of a samurai estate without using overt Japanese architecture.  It is sort of a \"what if\" an Akaviri style estate was built in Skyrim by the Nords.  There are three buildings: the main house, a bathhouse, and a dojo, which all surround a rock garden.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Many thanks to Emadwasfi and misalen for the videos!\r\n[youtube]4kTO8XRmPvw[/youtube] [youtube]k3t4rbe-hDI[/youtube]\r\n[u][b]Version History[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n[color=#3399FF][b]1.2[/b]\r\n- corrected missing texture issue on the red armour helmet[/color]\r\n\r\n[b]1.1[/b]\r\n- corrected missing texture issue on armour boots and swords\r\n\r\n[b]1.0[/b]\r\n- Original version\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]Description[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a player estate outside the town of Riverwood.  The intent is to have an player home that is reminiscent of an Akaviri or samurai estate if built by the Nords.  Hopefully the estate does not clash too much with the asthetic of the rest of the game.  It should be useful for either a samurai character or any character that has allied with the Blades.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the estate is located across a bridge found long the road between Riverwood and Whiterun.  At the end of the bridge is a gate.  The estate itself has three buildings, the main house, bathhouse, and dojo.  These surround a rock garden, which is also near a balcony looking out to Whiterun.  Behind the dojo are the various types of crafting stations.  Another boardwalk and stairs lead down to a small shrine.  The estate is maintained by a gardener, a cook, and a maid who follow their own daily routines about the grounds.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The front gate and buildings all require a key to enter.  This key is found in the secret room in the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood in a small box on a shelf.  Also in the box are a deed and letter from Delphine.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]Installation[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nExtract the archive into the main directory of you Skyrim installation, e.g.\r\n\r\nF:/Games/Steam/SteamApps/common/skyrim\r\n\r\nWhen starting the game select Data Files from the menu, then CHECK the checkbox for SamuraiEstate.esp.  \r\n\r\nOr you can use the Nexus Mod Manager to install.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]Uninstall[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nWhen starting the game select Data Files from the menu, then UNCHECK the checkbox for SamuraiEstate.esp.\r\n\r\nRemove the following directories and included files:\r\n\r\n Data/SamuraiEstate.esp\r\n Data/Music/garden.wav\r\n Data/meshes/weapons/Samurai\r\n Data/meshes/architecture/samurai\r\n Data/textures/architecture/armour\r\n Data/textures/architecture/tatami\r\n Data/textures/architecture/art\r\n Data/textures/weapons/Samurai\r\n Data/textures/actors/character/FaceGenData/FaceTint/SamuraiEstate.esp/\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]Known Issues[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n- If you place a horse inside the stable occasionally it will appear outside of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]Credits[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nBig thanks to Arcane51388 for allowing me to use so many of his items!\r\n\r\nArcane51388 - Skyrim Shogun - Samurai -WIP-\r\ntatami, music, bokuto\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33214/\r\n\r\nTheKrusty and Arcane51388 Genji Armor, Oblivion model by Nitiren - Samurai Genji Armour\r\nHelmet\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30299\r\n\r\n747823 - Weapons of the Third Era (used under general permission guidelines)\r\nKatanas and Wakizashis\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3871\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]Permissions[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nModders that wish to use all or part of this mod in future works please ask by message first.
