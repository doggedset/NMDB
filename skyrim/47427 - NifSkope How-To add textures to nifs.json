  "descriptionHtml": "This guide teaches you how to make adjustments to the textures attached to .nif files.\r\nThe information is stuff that I learned through other guides or through experimentation.\r\n\r\nI uploaded the original tutorial specifically to link to another member who was already familiar with modding, but it seems that in the short time it's been up it's gotten nothing but good reviews so I decided to expand on it. The original guide was short and sweet and highlighted only the things that the intended audience needed to know.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for reading my tutorial and I hope it helped!\r\nThanks to the wonderful people at NexusMods, members and staff.\r\nThanks Bethesda for making such an enjoyable game.\r\n\r\nOpen permission to upload my tutorial, you do not need to contact me for any\r\nreason at all.",
