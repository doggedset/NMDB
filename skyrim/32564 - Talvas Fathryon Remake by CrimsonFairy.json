So I decided to remake him younger and change a few things, and this is what I came up with. I hope you guys like it. :) This mod only changes his looks, it does not change anything else such as skills, perks, etc.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: There is a glitch some people get where Talvas&#39; beginning dialogue is a little messed up, and this has nothing to do with my mod, this is just something that Bethesda overlooked before releasing Dragonborn. My mod did not cause it, nor does it fix it. Sometimes people also experience this problem with other followers that have the same voice type as Talvas, such as Onmund and Erik the Slayer.\r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />Requirements/Recommended\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />Required:\r<br />Dragonborn.\r<br />The full version of [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168]ApachiiSkyHair[/url].

They&#39;re not required, but most of them are highly recommended.\r<br />\r<br />Recommended:\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24273]Ethereal Elven Overhaul[/url].\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27815]Fine Face Textures by Urshi[/url].\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/498]High Quality Eyes[/url] by Xenius.\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30411]Brows[/url] by Hvergelmir.\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722]The Eyes of Beauty[/url].\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21451]HQ Eyebrows - vanilla texture replacers[/url].\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4869]Covereyes[/url].\r<br />\r<br />ENBs used:\r<br />PINEAPPLEVISION ENBs.\r<br />ENBPM - Atmospheric ENB Series.\r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />Install/Uninstall\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />Extract files from archive into Skryim data folder. It shouldn&#39;t ask you to overwrite anything. And that&#39;s it&#33; If you use UFO then you&#39;re supposed to load follower mods under the UFO.esp in order for UFO changes to affect them.\r<br />\r<br />To uninstall, go into the Skyrim Data folder and delete Talvas by CrimsonFairy.esp and then go to Meshes, actors, character, FaceGenData, Facegeom, Dragonborn.esm and delete 00017777.NIF. Then go back to the Skyrim data folder and navigate to Textures, Actors, Character, FacegenData, FaceTint, Dragonborn.esm and delete 00017777.dds and 00017777.tga.\r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />Credits\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />Bethesda for making Skyrim and the Creation Kit.\r<br />\r<br />Apachii for letting me use one of her amazing hair styles.\r<br />\r<br />TairenSoul for letting me use her awesome warpaint.\r<br />\r<br />MissMorose for testing and taking screenshots.\r<br />\r<br />Urshi for testing.\r<br />\r<br />Big thanks to the community and my friends for being such a big inspiration to me. It&#39;s what keeps me modding&#33; ^_^\r<br />\r<br />And the Nexus creators and staff for their awesome work and website.\r<br />\r<br />Please let me know if I forgot someone&#33; I&#39;m pretty sure I got them all though.\r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />Usage/Permission\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />If you want to do something with my mod (as in, translating or uploading it somewhere) then you&#39;ll have to get permission from me first. If I give you my permission then you&#39;ll be directed to a couple other people you&#39;ll have to get permission from as well.\r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />Bugs/Incompatibilities\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />I don&#39;t know of any bugs so far, and there shouldn&#39;t be any since I only changed his appearance and didn&#39;t mess with anything else, but please let me know if you find any&#33; He probably won&#39;t be compatible with any other mods that change his appearance.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: Like stated above, there is a glitch some people get where Talvas&#39; beginning dialogue is a little messed up. And I repeat, this has nothing to do with my mod, this is just something that Bethesda overlooked.
