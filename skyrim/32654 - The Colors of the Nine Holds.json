  "summary": "Ever felt cities could use a bit more landscape? This adds that. Including banners, trees and clutter for the holds",
  "descriptionHtml": "Details:\r\nIn my 500+ Hour of gameplay I finally got sick of the vanilla cities and how they looked. Sure, people liked them for their original layout and simplicity but, cities like Whiterun don\\'t feel as crowded and as immersible as they should. \r\n\r\n-So, this mod fixes that, starting with Whiterun, the mod adds banners and clutter to the outside of houses while lighting up the area with Aspen trees of innumerable significance. Making the city seem tighter and more beautiful.\r\n\r\nVoting process: \r\n\r\nI have no idea where to start next but this will be a nine part series for each of the holds. So, if you could do me a favor and drop a comment or message for which hold you want me to to next. I\\'ll tally up and get to it (:\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\n1.) Unzip file to documents (Or folder of your choosing.\r\n2.) Copy and paste .esp into the Skyrim data folder\r\n3.) Load as The colors of Whiterun first then The Colors of the nine holds v. 1.00\r\n4.) Press play and enjoy (: Have fun!\r\n\r\nRecommended:\r\nIt is recommended that you do not use any exterior mods for Breezehome. Like my scaffold. As the trees will clip through and the finished product won\\'t look great\r\n\r\nSide Notes: \r\n\r\nI am deeply enjoying the modding scene and will most likely continue. But I am going to need fresh ideas, not that I don\\'t have any! But it would be nice to incorporate a community aspect to my mods. (: I am deeply enjoying the feedback and hope to hear from you all in the future. Drop a comment! Thank you! (:",
