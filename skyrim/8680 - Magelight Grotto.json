  "descriptionHtml": "Magelight Grotto\r\n\tby Sheen\r\n____________________________________________\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n____________________________________________\r\n\r\nThis mod was made originally just for me (also happens to be my first mod), but I figured I might as well share if anyone wants. It adds a little cave with every crafting station meant to be used as player housing. It\\'s fairly simple and straightforward and meant for characters that would rather live in nature. Magelight Grotto is located near the Eldergleam Sanctuary in a hole in the ground. Check the screenshots provided for further help locating it if necessary. To move around once inside the cave, you will need to locate climbing pickaxes which are in certain areas around the cave. I\\'ve placed them in visible spots but inconspicuously enough so that they won\\'t disturb the \\\"nature\\\" feel of the cave. As for a storage container, there\\'s a hollowed-out tree stump available to store your goods.\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n____________________________________________\r\n\r\nSimply drop Magelight Grotto into your Skyrim\\\\Data folder and enable the plugin.\r\n\r\nTo uninstall, simply delete \\\"Magelight Grotto.esp\\\". This .esp doesn\\'t use files that aren\\'t already in the game.\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\n\r\nUPDATE\r\n____________________________________________\r\n\r\nAdded an empty version without the bedroll nor crafting stations for use with any mod that allows you to place objects, such as [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11163/?]Frostfall[/url] or [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22791/?]Home Construction and Decoration[/url] since I could never figure out how to make a system similar to what the Build Your Own Home guy later developed because I have no clue how to make scripts.",
