  "descriptionHtml": "DESCRIPTION\r\n================\r\n\r\nWhat I have done is I have tweaked values for ALL Ancient Nordic Wares in the Creation Kit. Due to this tweaking, Draugr may be a little unbeatable. YOU may be unbeatable, also as a result of this tweaking.\r\n\r\nSUSPECTED BUGS\r\n===================\r\n\r\n- You may be killed in one hit by Draugr as a result of their weapons being tweaked.\r\n+ To combat this bug, learn all of the Fire Breath Shout words and use that on the Draugr - It\\'s super effective!\r\n\r\nI am also the authour of the \\\"Improved Ebony Wares\\\" mod, and the installation instructions are as basic as any other single-file mod.
