This mod isn\\'t anything very fancy. I didn\\'t go adding a bunch of new textures or anything, I just used all the tools that the Skyrim.esm and the CK provided me.\r\n\r\n[b]Without giving too much away the mod adds a few main things to the farm: [/b]\r\n[list] [*]3 additional farmhands to help poor Vantus Loreius\r\n[*]2 new merchants (food and a blacksmith)\r\n[*]2 new houses and a tent for the NPCs\r\n[*]A home the player can purchase and upgrade\r\n[*]A forge, grindstone, workbench, and tanning rack\r\n[*]A small garden for Curwe to tend to\r\n[*]My brother\\'s cameo appearance as a Nordic barbarian guard\r\n[*]A new follower (the barbarian mentioned above)\r\n[*]5 journals portraying the back stories to the NPCs\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]To Do List:[/b]\r\n[list][*]Place a guard post between Loreius and the gaints to the north\r\n[*]Expand further on the existing NPCs\\' stories\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nFeel free to comment and contact me regarding any concerns or suggestions.\r\n[b][color=#FF0000]If you like the file please endorse it![/color][/b]",
