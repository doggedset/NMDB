  "summary": "A very dim version of Candlight",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a quick and dirty mod I made that i figured I\\'de throw for people who may want it, but don\\'t know how to make it themselves.\r\n\r\nI like the very dark dungeon mods, but I still want to be able to \\\"sort of\\\" see where I\\'m going. The problem is, as far as I was concerned Candlelight and torches are just way too bright and ruin the whole point of having a dark dungeon. \r\n\r\nSo, I quickly made a version of Candlelight that is VERY dim. It lights up the area in a very small radius, just enough so you can see what you\\'re doing, but not enough to ruin the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe spell is named \\\"AegisLight\\\". The name doesn\\'t hold any real significance I just needed something to identify it with real quick.\r\n\r\nTo use this mod, throw the ESP into your Data folder and activate it. Go ingame and type:\r\n\r\nplayer.help Aegislight 4\r\n\r\nthen player.addspell (ID) \r\n\r\nID being whatever the spell ID is.\r\n\r\nI won\\'t be making any edits on this mod. I won\\'t be updating it, if you can\\'t figure out how to use it... Sorry.",
