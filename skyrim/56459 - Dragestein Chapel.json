  "descriptionHtml": "This has become *my* player home in Skyrim. The main file doesn&#39;t rely on any of the DLC&#39;s, for people who want a much more vanilla home. I like making something more beautiful to work with the world of Skyrim, and hopefully this pleases everyone greatly. \r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]Dragestein Chapel[/b][/size] used to belong to a Knight of the Nine who frequently studied with the Greybeards, and after the White Gold Concordat, received visions of a Dragonborn to make his home there. Here, on the banks of the White River, just outside the Riverwood bridge, this home has many and more of what you&#39;d need in a player home. Two manikins, many weapon plaques, crafting stations, a double bed and single bed, and secret room. Besides for the necessities and clutter, I always want to make something immensely pleasing to the eyes. I have also given the place a proper day/night cycle&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Requires:\r<br />- Skyrim&#39;s latest version\r<br />- The Update\r<br />\r<br />Installation:\r<br />- Only one file to place in your Skyrim &gt; Data folder. \r<br />\r<br />Location: \r<br />- Just northeast of Riverwood, by the bridge out of town. \r<br />\r<br />Known incompatibilities:\r<br />- Anything using the Riverwood03 cell and surrounding land, including Castle Riverwood, Gentesters&#39; White River Cottage, Jack Ga&#39;s Pub, and my Beckwood Manor. I&#39;ll see if anything can be done about incompatibilities when they come to light.\r<br />\r<br />And videos here, made by the kind SplitztikzGaming and Thyworm&#33;:\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]7Na9ljCg4Lk[/youtube] [youtube]i7yCxD4Ekpo[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]CHANGE LOG:[/b][/size]\r<br />- DAWNGUARD DLC now in use&#33; The chapel has been renovated to use Soul Cairn and Vampire resources to create a darker cathedral. \r<br />- Lighting has been adjusted to provide a continuous ambiance while still adjusting to a day/night cycle.\r<br />- Six beds for followers and/or children.\r<br />- New master bedroom included with garden above overlooking the river&#33; ",
