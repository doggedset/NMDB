  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is to help people who make a new game and then suddenly can&#39;t figure out what they want to do. There are 3 books inside Helgen Keep, each of them have their own class information.\r<br />\r<br />Volume 1 shows Warrior Type Classes, Volume 2 shows Mage Type Classes and Volume 3 shows Thief Type Classes.\r<br />\r<br />There shouldn&#39;t be any incompatability issues, as all it does is add 3 books to where you start. Unless you happen to have a mod that changes a place you hardly ever visit - Helgen Keep.\r<br />\r<br />P.S: I suck at making books, so you have to turn the page to see the next part.",
