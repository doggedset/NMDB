  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u]WHY YOU MADE THIS BRO?[/u][/b]\r<br />So Skyrim ( and all Bethesda games to some degree ) have this issue where you will at some point spend time just travelling from point A to point B.  This happens even in my game that I have desperately crammed a bunch of mods into in an effort to make combat happen as much as possible.  These periods of quiet travel are made better if I can sprint like a mad man.  That&#39;s why I made this.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]YO WHAT THIS DO?\r<br />[/u][/b]Basically, if you&#39;re not in combat then sprinting costs no stamina and you can do it forever.\r<br />If you enter combat, sprinting costs the normal amount.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]IS THIS GOING TO DO BAD THINGS\r<br />[/u][/b]No.  Thanks to a friend of mine I made this mod in the smart way that doesn&#39;t destroy everything.  No constantly running scripts.  The script it has is very short and only runs when you start sprinting, hence no performance impact.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Thank You to:\r<br />- tonycubed2 for making sure I made the mod correctly, check out his awesome mod Ultimate Deadly Encounters ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12452/? )\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Shout out:\r<br />- if you want sprinting to be free all the time no matter what, check out Carry On Sprinting by Shaedanna ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73023/? )\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]FAQ\r<br />[/u][/b]\r<br />[i]Q: Shouldn&#39;t this be in the cheating category?  Isn&#39;t this cheating?  AREN&#39;T YOU A CHEATER&#33;?\r<br />[/i][b]A: No, because this doesn&#39;t change what happens during combat.  Out of combat this just means you don&#39;t have to keep doing that dumb thing where you slow down for a few seconds repeatedly.[/b][b]\r<br />\r<br />[/b][i]Q: Can you upload a video of what the mod does?\r<br />[/i][b]A: No... primarily because my modded Skyrim is constant porn.  Also because wtf even?\r<br />\r<br />[/b][i]Q: Will this make me into a cool Naruto ninja?\r<br />[/i][b]A: Naruto is an anime about wizards, not ninjas.\r<br />\r<br />[/b][i]Q: Are you going to make something like this for Fallout 4?\r<br />[/i][b]A: Yeah probably.  It&#39;s probably gonna be part of the remake of my Fallout 3 mod... the one that breaks your legs if you carry too much.\r<br />\r<br />[/b][i]Q: I love you.\r<br />[/i][b]A: Get out of my bookstore.[/b]",
