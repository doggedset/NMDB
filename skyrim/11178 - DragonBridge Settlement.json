If you have any specific question just PM me.\r\n\r\nName: DragonBridge Settlement\r\nVersion: 1.0\r\nDate: 2012/02/25\r\nCategory: Home\r\nRequirements: Skyrim\r\nAuthor: Rowan Leeves\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n===========\r\nA cozy, carefully decorated home for the player.\r\n\r\nWhat you will NOT find in the house:\r\nAnimal heads\r\nRandomly placed objects\r\nBaskets\r\nBuckets\r\n\r\nWhat you will find in the house:\r\n-Cheese. Lots of cheese.\r\n-Many chests for storage. Some are named, but most are not.\r\n-Three respawning chests. They are named \\\"Mysterious chest of Ingots\\\" (respawn 1 ingot of each type), \\\"Mysterious chest of Ingredients (respawns one of each ingredient except red nirnroot), \\\"Mysterious urn of Disposal\\\" (your favorite trash can).\r\n-Armory\r\n-Azura and Meridia\\'s statue, so don\\'t download if you\\'re not a fan.\r\n-Two small copies of Stendar and Talos\\' shrines. (No script attached).\r\n-Plants and trees... yes yes, inside the house.\r\n-And last but not least, a bathroom. 200 years after Oblivion crisis, still no bathrooms on Nirn even if there is magic and splenid architectures... and noble Dwemer technologies. Go figure...\r\n\r\nPlease note:\r\nThis was a lot of fun, and pretty hellish as well because I used the Windhelm house Hjerim (you know, the same house where there is a murder...) and because the CK is still very buggy. There might be little bugs even if I am sure the house is clean.\r\nIt was tested on both a modded and not modded Skyrim.\r\nThe stairs in the bathroom are difficult to walk on (vanilla mesh...). Jumping is required...\r\n\r\nThis was mostly experimental - I am still getting used to the CK. Eventually I will create a bigger home, more detailed and stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n========\r\nNear DragonBridge. There is a map marker you can fast travel to.\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n1. Copy RL_DragonBridgeSettlement.esp and bsa file to Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\\r\n2. Start Skyrim Launcher, click \\'Data Files\\', place a checkmark beside RL_DragonBridgeSettlement.esp\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\n1. Start SkyrimLauncher, click Data Files, uncheck RL_DragonBridgeSettlement.esp\r\n2. Delete the RL_DragonBridgeSettlement.esp and bsa file\r\n\r\nTools Used:\r\n========\r\nTES Creation Kit\r\nNifskope\r\nTime and lots of cursing\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n=====\r\nRebelOConnor, for the invisible chair, and support.\r\nBethesda\r\nO",
