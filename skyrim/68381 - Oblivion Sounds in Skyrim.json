  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4]Description[/size]\r<br />If you ask me Oblivion has a better soundtrack than Skyrim, but I also believe Oblivion has better general sounds. Oblivion Sounds in Skyrim replaces most sounds in Skyrim such as footsteps, spell impacts, weapon clinks,Â activation sounds, etc. with Oblivion ones. There are some sounds in Skyrim that obviously don&#39;t have Oblivion equivalents, those are left alone. Dialogue isn&#39;t changed except for the guards if you use that optional file.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Compatibility[/size]\r<br />It&#39;s not compatible with any sound mods, but music mods are fine.\r<br />\r<br />Note: Please own Oblivion if you download this mod.",
