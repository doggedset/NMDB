  "summary": "Alters the standard sneak speed to be the speed of normal running, while leaving the slow stealthy sneak speed alone.",
  "descriptionHtml": "All this mod does is simply alter the standard sneak speed to be the speed of normal running.  The slow stealthy sneak speed is left alone so that the actual sneaking mechanic doesn&#39;t get interfered with.\r<br />\r<br />It should be compatible with any other mod except those that also alter sneak speed.  It may be best to load this mod after any other sneaking / stealth mod so that the modified speed doesn&#39;t get overwritten.\r<br />\r<br />The only reason I created this mod was to be able to run while using the sneaking animation.  I thought perhaps someone else might find it useful.",
