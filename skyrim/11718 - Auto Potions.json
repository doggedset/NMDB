  "descriptionHtml": "0.02a\r\n\r\nAUTO POTION\r\n\r\nThis allows the consumtion of potions automatically, calculations are based on needs so it does not use a major healing potion if not needed, it does try to be conservative, if no health potions are found in the health percentages that it is searching for then it will use a random potion in your inventory. At the moment it does not support custom potions from other mods as it is hard to tell what the potion heals for later on ill add a otion to use the potions from other modders once find a solution\r\n\r\nThe idea came from when i was developing my old addon before the Creation Kit was released called \\\"Thief\\\"",
