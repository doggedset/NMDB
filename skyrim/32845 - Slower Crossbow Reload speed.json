  "summary": "The name says it all!",
  "descriptionHtml": "Hello! It has always bothered me that IMO Crossbow reload time was awfully fast.I recall watching Videos and interviews with devs of Dawnguard describing it as Slower then a bow but stronger, and I feel it is stronger..but not quite slow enough. ( I aslos boosted damage slightly to crossbows)\r\n\r\nThis mod Requires skyrim and Dawnguard\r\nI would like to say this is my 1st mod Iv uploaded and would like constructive criticism please and if I ever get better would love to make more mods(Like the best damn Werebear overhaul mod to see the light of day...thats my dream anyway)\r\n",
