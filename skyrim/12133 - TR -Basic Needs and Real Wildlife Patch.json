  "descriptionHtml": "I simply added the light snack, medium meal, and filling food effects from TR-BN to the new foods added by RWS. \r\n\r\nI am NOT aware if I need permissions to simply make a patch, but if I do, let me know, and I will take down the mod until such a time as I have permission from the two modders to release this patch.\r\n\r\nI made this for myself, thought I\\'d upload it. I take no credit for anything done in either of these mods, all the credit goes to the creators of their respective mod. Great job guys, thank you.\r\n\r\nTell me if it doesn\\'t work, I\\'m still new to the modding community. Also, if the NMM install doesn\\'t work, simply put the esp in your data folder. Once again, still new to this.",
