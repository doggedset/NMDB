All you have to do to claim Caius is kill Dylus&#33; (Make sure to take the rings from his body)[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][line][/size][/font][font=antique book]\r<br />[size=6][b][color=#87ceeb][color=#3c78d8][font=OblivionFont]Description[/font][/color][/color][/b][/size]\r<br />[color=#cfe2f3][size=4]Now, you may be thinking, &#34;what the F*** is a small, scrawny fox going to do to protect me in combat?&#34; Well, first of all, never under-estimate the power of small creatures. Second, this is no ordinary fox. As you play the game, (and by all means PLEASE read the journal&#33; It kinda explains some things) you will notice that this fox has a rather unique ability to master arcane ability in the school of destruction AND he also has the ability to shout&#33; (he can currently only use fire breath, frost breath, and unrelenting force HOWEVER there is not really a sound when he shouts . . . probably because foxes don&#39;t speak *LOGIC*) Anyway, Caius not only does those things, but his previous master created rings for him to use. These rings give Caius the ability to have either a Frost, Fire, or lighting cloak whilst he is in combat. All you have to do is give Caius the ring you want him to wear, and he will equip it automatically. Now you may notice that his master gave Caius a collar that makes him appear black and shadowy (mainly for the rogue-type players like myself). I thought that this gives him a sort of unique appearance and cool personality, but if you do not like this (which I am sure some of you won&#39;t) simply remove the collar from his inventory and *poof* - Normal fox skin&#33; Caius automatically has this collar equipped &#34;Dylus&#34; located on the bed in Alchemists Shack (screenshots above). If you tell Caius to go home, he will go back to his little doghouse that his previous master built for him. The journal that kind of explains the full back story on Dylus replaces the previous journal called &#34;Alchemist&#39;s Journal&#34;. If you would like to have this journal, type in the command &#34;player.additem 000CE5BD 1&#34; without the quotation marks via console commands. If you don&#39;t know how to access console commands, simply hit the tilda key located right next to the &#34;1&#34; key on your keyboard. Some people also call it the &#34;squiggly-line&#34; key. If you have no clue what I am talking about, then we are going to have issues here. I think I&#39;ve covered everything, I will from time to time update this if I realized I missed something.[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br /> [size=6][b][font=OblivionFont][color=#3c78d8]Bugs/Known Glitches[/color][/font][/b][/size]\r<br />[size=3][color=#cfe2f3]-DO NOT give Caius a sheild of any type&#33; Caius will automatically equip it, and for whatever reason will always be &#34;blocking&#34; even thought it doesn&#39;t seem like it.
