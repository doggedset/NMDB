  "summary": "A mod that makes Torsten Cruel-Sea slightly more appealing.",
  "descriptionHtml": "--What This Mod Does--\r\nThis mod only changes the appearance of Torsten, so that he is better-looking.\r\nTHIS DOES NOT MAKE HIM A FOLLOWER.\r\n(Changes that I made to this NPC:)\r\n-set the NPC weight to 100 for a better body\r\n-set the NPC scale to 1.03\r\n-blonde hair lightened\r\n-tweaked facial features to look better (lips, chin, and checkbones)\r\n\r\n--How To Install--\r\nDownload my main file(s) put them in your Skyrim/Data/  folder, and check off Torsten.esp in your data load order.\r\nYou MAY have an issue with neck seam, just target npc in console, and disable then enable, SHOULD fix it.\r\n\r\n--Recommended Mods This Works With--\r\nBetter males - Beautiful nudes and faces - New hairstyles by Chris57 and FavoredSoul\r\nIt IS possible to make him your follower with the instant-marry mod:\r\n          <<Multiple Marriages-Spouse Dress Up-Rehousing-And More by Dudestia>>\r\nUPDATE!! Torsten may now be your follower or legitimate husband, by using this mod:\r\nskyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36520\r\n\r\n--Why I Made This Mod--\r\nI just like Torsten, seems friendly even when first meeting him.  I wish he was a more important NPC in the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nIF YOU LIKE MY MOD - Endorse it, and feel free to upload your own pics, I\\'d love to see what people think!\r\n\r\n--Known Issues/Bugs--\r\nAt the moment there is a slight neck seam, as always when dealing with a premade NPC, it\\'s very subtle at most.  If you don\\'t like it you\\'re free to mess with my .esp in CK to fix it, and at the very least, remove the mod and revert him back to vanilla version.\r\nUPDATE>> Work around/fix for neck seam:  \r\nBring up the console with \\\" ~ \\\" button, target Torsten, type setnpcweight 50, type disable, type enable.  Should fix him from here on.",
