  "descriptionHtml": "A small fix for Locaster&#39;s &#34;Become King of Riverhelm&#34; mod. Fixes the texture of Riverhelm banners.\r<br />\r<br />&#34;Become King of Riverhelm&#34; is an amazing mod. I could even say it&#39;s my favorite one of all. Though, there was one tiny flaw, and, ironically, it&#39;s everywhere you go in Riverhelm: [i]banners[/i]. Or, to be more precise, their fringes. Those black edges where they should be transparent were just painful to see, and the author(s) didn&#39;t seem to bother with fixing it at all, even though the mod was updated a lot. So, I decided to pick up the banner ([i]pun fully intended[/i]) and fix it myself.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Installation[/u][/b]: simply put the contents of the archive into your ...&#92;Skyrim&#92;Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Requirements[/u][/b]:  &#34;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16374/?]Become King of Riverhelm[/url]&#34; mod by Locaster, obviously. Without that it&#39;s just a pretty texture in an archive.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Compatibility[/u][/b]: with everything.\r<br />",
