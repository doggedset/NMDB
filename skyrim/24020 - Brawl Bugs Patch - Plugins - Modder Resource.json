  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5]Brawl Bugs Patch, Plugins, and Modder\\'s Resources[/size]\r\nby jonwd7\r\n\r\nv1.0 \r\n[url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1405489-fixing-the-brawl-bug-with-cloak-method-of-attaching-scripts]Original Thread[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Brawl Bugs patch was borne out of my work on my own Footprints mod.  I am\r\nslow to release these kinds of things, and my footwork can be seen in previous\r\nversions such as the Brawl Bug Plugin by trebtreb, and in my own Footprints\r\nmod in versions prior to 0.7.  This fix is more general and should not require\r\nmodders to adapt their work, and should even work on existing mods with the\r\nbug without any changes from the modder.  It also addresses more bugs with\r\nthe Brawl-type scripts.\r\n\r\nFor modders, I have included a resource package which they are free to include\r\nin their BSA. Please also check out the tutorial below, which covers how to \r\nprevent the Brawl Bug without inclusion of my patch or scripts. \r\n\r\n[size=4][url=http://www.creationkit.com/Dynamically_Attaching_Scripts]Modder\\'s Tutorial[/url][/size]\r\n\r\n[b][u]USKP Bug Reports[/u][/b]\r\n[url=http://bugzilla.darkcreations.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3444]USKP: \\'Brawl Bug\\' report[/url]\r\n[url=http://bugzilla.darkcreations.org/show_bug.cgi?id=301]USKP: \\'Healing While Brawling\\' report[/url]\r\n[url=http://bugzilla.darkcreations.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3727]USKP: Additional Brawl bugs[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\nFAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)\r\n==============================================================================\r\nQ: \\\"How does it work?\\\"\r\nA: It uses a \\\"sieve\\\" approach, in that it only allows magic effect keywords\r\nthrough that have been considered tangible, detrimental, or harmful.\r\n\r\nQ: \\\"Which version should I download?\\\"\r\nA: If you are a user with Skyrim 1.6 or higher, you should download the \r\n\\\"Compatibility Edition\\\" (CE).  The CE does not edit any vanilla forms.\r\n\r\nQ: \\\"What should I do as a modder?\\\"\r\nA: You should follow [url=http://www.creationkit.com/Dynamically_Attaching_Scripts]this tutorial at the CK Wiki[/url].\r\nIt provides steps to circumvent the Brawl Bug in your mod without editing\r\nvanilla forms or vanilla scripts.  Additionally, you can download the \r\nmodder\\'s resource package here, and include the modified scripts in your BSA.\r\n\r\nQ: \\\"What else does it fix?\\\"\r\nA: It covers a bit more than the straight-up \\'Brawl Bug\\'. There were various\r\nissues with the scripts such as OnHit/OnMagicEffectApply clashes, and a lack \r\nof using \\\"states\\\" which prevent a block from running more than once.  Using \r\nsome types of magic effects during a Brawl could cause Papyrus errors.\r\n\r\nIt also restores player healing behavior during Brawls which Bethesda had \r\ntaken out due to their buggy implementation (which was left commented out in\r\nthe scripts).  Now, as per the dialogue, you can no longer use magic in order\r\nto heal yourself, buff yourself, or cast summons.  This is considered cheating\r\nand the Brawl immediately ends.  The opponent gets to keep your money.\r\n\r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\nWHAT THIS FIXES\r\n==============================================================================\r\n1. The following scripts were affected in some way by the \\\"Brawl Bug\\\":\r\n- DGIntimidatePlayerScript\r\n- DGIntimidateAliasScript\r\n- C00VilkasScript\r\n- C00TrainerScript\r\n- MS11CalixtoScript (Questionable)\r\n- CompanionsSingleCombatantScript (Questionable)\r\n- BladesSparringScript (Most likely not affected, but included anyway)\r\n\r\n2. Player healing behavior during Brawls.  As per the dialogue, and Bethesda\\'s\r\nown code which was buggy (and therefore commented out), healing, casting buffs,\r\nor summoning during Brawls is now considered cheating.  \r\n\r\n3. The scripts did not use states to avoid race conditions. This led to errors\r\nprinted to your logs if you would cheat with certain MGEFs, like Flames for\r\nexample.  Flames would fire continuous OnHit/OnMagicEffectApply blocks and\r\nlead to Papyrus errors. I also short circuit the OnHit event when the source\r\nis a Spell, and let OnMagicEffectApply handle it to avoid block clashing.\r\n\r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n==============================================================================\r\nInstall the BSA and ESP to your Data folder.\r\nLoad as EARLY AS POSSIBLE in your load order.\r\n\r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\nUNINSTALLATION\r\n==============================================================================\r\nRemove the ESP and BSA from your data folder. It is NOT recommended to \r\nuninstall ANY mod in the middle of a save game. However, the worst that should\r\nhappen by removing this patch is a few warnings in your Papyrus logs.\r\n\r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\nCOMPATIBILITY\r\n==============================================================================\r\nThere are no known compatibility issues.  Put early in your load order and \r\nany changes will be overwritten by the later mod.  If in doubt, download and\r\nuse the Compatibility Edition instead. (This requires Skyrim 1.6+)\r\n\r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\nCHANGELOG\r\n==============================================================================\r\n1.0 - Initial Release\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n==============================================================================\r\nPERMISSIONS / LICENSING\r\n==============================================================================\r\n- Permission is NOT given to redistribute this mod in whole or in part.\r\n- MODDERS: You have permission to include the resource files directly in your\r\nmods.
