  "descriptionHtml": "Silver is a valuable metal, and especially priced for its usage in jewelry. Sadly it's a rarity in Skyrim because everyone is busy turning it into worthless plates, flagons, and goblets.\n<br />\n<br />This mod adds a series of recipes to the smelter, which allow the player to melt down silverware items into silver ingots.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]3 goblets/cubs per ingot[/b]\n<br />[*][b]2 plates/platters per ingot[/b]\n<br />[*][b]1 jug, flagon, or bowl forms one ingot[/b]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Does not require any DLC or other addons.\n<br />Should be compatible with pretty much anything.\n<br />\n<br />Feel free to edit the recipes, if you feel like they're unrealistic/inbalanced/etc.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Note: [/b]Two types of Silverware (namely \"Silver Jug\" and \"Silver Cup\") have not been added to this mod. The reasoning is twofold:\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]They are added by the Dawnguard DLC, and I wanted this mod to be independent\n<br />[*]They're the versions you find at Castle Volkihar, meaning they're all slathered with blood, and are better used as grimy-vampirism-ornaments, than for smelting.\n<br />[/list]",
