  "modName": "Illusion Magic Improvement",
  "summary": "Makes changes to the expert and master level illusion spells and adds a few new expert and master level illusion spells to make high level illusion more enjoyable. Also a basic version available with no added spells. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Sought to fix frenzy spell not working against high level mobs and ended up doing a bit more.... \r\n\r\nNote that a basic version has been added with no new spells. See File for details. \r\n\r\nChanges: Vanilla master illusion spells increased to level 60 and duration increased to 120 seconds. Expert level invisibility spell set at 60 seconds.  Expert level illusion spells now raised to affect level 22 creatures. \r\n\r\nNew spells Expert Level:\r\n\r\nInvisibility Other (make another invisible for 60 seconds)\r\nNight Eye (night vision for 75 seconds)\r\nHavoc (frenzy opponent to level 25)\r\n\r\nNew Spells Master Level:\r\n\r\nMaster Invisibility (invisibility and muffle for 240 seconds)\r\nMaster Invisibility Other (invisibility and muffle on target for 240 seconds)\r\nMassive NPC Invisibility (NPCs within 500 feet invisible for 180 seconds)\r\nCommand Animal (Command Animal for 120 seconds 75 feet AOE) \r\nBecome Ethereal (can\\'t be attacked or attack for 60 seconds) \r\n\r\nBuy spells from Drevis Neloren at appropriate illusion skill level. Master spells require completion of quest given by him. (done intentionally) \r\n\r\nKnown bugs... NPCs will not act as though they are invisible.. kids still ask to be invisible. NPCs may have messed up eyes when invisibility wears off (game flaw).. insane experience from spells.. fixed. \r\n\r\nInstallation: Use the mod manager or read the readme file in the 7z file. This will likely not conflict with other spell mods as it\\'s a simple mod but if it does let me know. \r\n\r\nIf you have any comments or suggestions feel free to post them. I\\'m certainly open to alter this simple mod to add or modify spell features if there is demand for it.  \r\n\r\n",
