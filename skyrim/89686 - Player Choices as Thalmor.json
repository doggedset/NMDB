  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds dialogue to the interaction with Tsun in Sovngarde.\n<br />\n<br />Now when he asks you by what right you can pass, you can answer in a wholesomely thalmor way.\n<br />\n<br />As bonuses, I have added a few things for your enjoyment in Markarth as well as a series of thalmor oriented handbills at the Embassy.Â  Keep in mind that this is still in Beta, and will be improved upon.\n<br />\n<br />The eventual Goal is to create a mod that will add more immersion and interest to the Thalmor, culminating in a quest unique to the faction. Let me know in case of any bugs or such.\n<br />\n<br />To that end I am looking for people to help me out with fleshing out the various questlines. PM me and I'll get back to you :).\n<br />\n<br />NOTE: You'll find the books ontop Rulindil's table and on the floor as you enter Elenwen's Solar.",
