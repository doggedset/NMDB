  "descriptionHtml": "REQUIRES DRAGONBORN\r\n\r\nAs I was playing Skyrim, I loved how the Telvanni Robes looked, but was disappointed that, as I was playing a female character, I would only be able to use Ildari\\'s robes that had that ugly heart stone thing on it. So, I set out to fix this.\r\n\r\nHere\\'s what I did:\r\n-Renamed Ildari\\'s version of the robes to \\\"Ildari\\'s Telvanni Robes\\\"\r\n-Made it so where Neloth will sell the actual Telvanni Robes as well as the Telvanni Boots.\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nI did NOT change any item in the game, with the exception of renaming Ildari\\'s robes to make it less confusing.",
