You might get a little FPS drop, not much but if you run a low-end pc, this mod maybe isn\\'t something for you. As far as I know no bugs with other mods. If you already have a texture pack installed, when it asks you to overwrite TEXTURES, just say yes to all. Just add it to NMM and istall it! Have fun! ;)",
