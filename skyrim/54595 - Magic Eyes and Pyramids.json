  "descriptionHtml": "** Version 1.2\r<br />What&#39;s new for Version 1.2?  Magic Eyes&#33;  Because everyone wants to have a giant eye hovering over their heads. =P  This was another &#34;abandoned update&#34; I \r<br />started ages ago.  The main reason I gave up on it, was the bump map for the veins I had originally created wasn&#39;t working--basically when I enabled that the seams for the UVW map reared their ugly head (never was good with UVW maps--which is why I typically stuck with procedurals on non-flat surfaces).  Thus, no vein bump map.\r<br />\r<br />What you will get: Eye of Magic (fortify magicka), Cat Eye of Magic (fortify magicka), and Skull of Magic (fortify destruction magic). The skull is obviously not an eye, but it was something I was experimenting with and decided to throw it in.  Not sure if I put a havok on it, so I don&#39;t recommend dropping it on the ground. Also, I flagged all items to be wearable by Argonian and Khajiit, so hopefully anyone who was trying to use it (with one of those races) now can.  Hopefully . . .\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />==============\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.1.\r<br />\r<br />Per multiple requests, the rotating roman numerals have been removed from the enchanted versions.  The clock remains for the armored version--just so folks have a choice. ;)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />****\r<br />\r<br />Magic Pyramid - Version 1.\r<br />\r<br />What is it?  I was messing around with animation and had some idea about a refracting pyramid with runes rotating over a mage&#39;s head, and . . . You can see the results.\r<br />\r<br />There are 6 magic variations:\r<br />\r<br />Pyramid of Magic (fortify magicka)\r<br />Pyramid of Magicka (fortify magicka rate)\r<br />Pyramid of Conjury (fortify conjuration)\r<br />Pyramid of Destruction (fortify destruction)\r<br />Pyramid of Restoration (fortify restoration)\r<br />Pyramid of Healing (fortify healing rate)\r<br />\r<br />Also included is an &#34;armored&#34; version that isn&#39;t enchanted, and also has a less &#34;lively&#34; glow effect.\r<br />\r<br />All can be crafted at the forge (not quite so easy/cheap contructions materials as some of my other mods), and take the circlet slot.\r<br />\r<br />Credit for the awesome runes brushes (used for the rune circles) goes to OBSIDIAN DAWN @ http://www.obsidiandawn.com.  I highly recommend checking out some of the other brushes available there.  A nice, high quality, collection.",
