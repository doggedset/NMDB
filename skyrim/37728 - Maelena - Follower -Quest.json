  "descriptionHtml": "[center]\r\n[img]http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb281/Syn_gaia/Maelenaname_zps934f9975.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[size=4]Maelena is a Breton female that can be a follower and is also marriageable.\r\n\r\nShe headed to Skyrim on her own to start a new life and discovered adventure of her own. Young, eager, and very good at being unseen, Maelena travels to different cities trying to find her calling. She eventually finds it in Riften, which is where you can find her.\r\n\r\nHer fighting style is rogue and she comes prepared with two enchanted daggers, a bow, and is initially wearing Thieves Guild armor. (I would like to change this to a custom armor, but since I am new to modding I am unsure how.)[B]If you would like her to wear different armor, simply give her different armor to wear.[/B]\r\n\r\nThere is a small quest that you can start after she is your follower. It isn\\'t an official quest and there are no markers, but with a little digging around you can discover that Maelena planned searching for something, but I don\\'t want to ruin anything. [I]This is just a little addition to make her more than your average follower. It isn\\'t a grand quest and is mostly just a little \\\"search until you find it\\\" sort of deal.[/I]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb281/Syn_gaia/Maelenaeyes_zpsd3ae1319.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[B][U]Where is she?[/U][/B]\r\nAt the Bee and Barb in Riften.\r\n\r\n[B][U]What is the armor she is wearing in the pictures?[/U][/B]\r\nThe armor in the pictures is called Elite Rogue Armour by KungFuMasterPS. She is wearing the retextured version by anka01. The headband is from KD Circlets. Links below.\r\n\r\n[B][U]There is a quest? Where? What?[/U][/B] [i]Small spoiler[/i]\r\n[color=#383838]Well, sort of. Check her inventory and you will figure out the rest.[/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[U][B]Mods used and recommended[/B][/U]\r\nApachii Skyhair\r\nCoverwomen\r\nThe Eyes of Beauty\r\nUNP Body\r\nElite Rogue Armor\r\nKDCirclets Redone\r\n\r\n[B]::Please Note::[/B] - Because she isn\\'t entirely standalone, she may not look exactly she way she does in my screenshots. If you want her to look exactly like that then you need the mods listed above. Her skin texture, body type, and eyes will resemble whatever mods you may have downloaded that affect the women in skyrim. Her hair is however standalone.\r\n\r\n\r\n[B][/U]Credits and Thanks[/U][/B]\r\n\r\nFirst of all I\\'d like to thank VRDaphni and shadowtigers for helping be figure out a few things on making followers. I had asked for their help for a different follower that I have yet to upload. But without their help this upload probably wouldn\\'t have made it. So thank you both!\r\n\r\n[B]Links:[/B]\r\nKDCirclets Redone by zzjay - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27064//?\r\nElite Rogue Armor - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30189//?\r\nElite Rogue Armor Retexture - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35682//?\r\nCoverwomen - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3563//?\r\nThe Eyes of Beauty - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722//?\r\nDimonized UNP Body (ADULT CONTENT) - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709//?\r\n\r\n[/size]\r\n[/center]",
