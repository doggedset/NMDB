  "descriptionHtml": "[center][IMG]http://i1180.photobucket.com/albums/x404/WiegandGraphics/anws-Big-Banner.png[/IMG][/center]\r\n[IMG]http://i1180.photobucket.com/albums/x404/WiegandGraphics/anws-features.png[/IMG]\r\n-This mod adds new armor and weapons to the Ragged Flagon in Riften.\r\nThe Items have some mini-lore in the form of a book which details The Nightguard and where this armor set drew it\\'s name-sake. The Armor has a mist/shadow effect like the Ebony Mail however it is applied via the skin of the character, not the armor, making it look much better. The effect is also tapered down so that archery with this armor is not as hard on your eyes. The effects of both the new armor and the Ebony mail no longer have a poison effect either, the effect often foiled sneak attack attempts and so I removed it.\r\n\r\n-Inspiration is from \r\n(Game of Thrones, TV series) \\\"The Night\\'s Watch\\\"\r\nEbony Mail / Boethiah\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1180.photobucket.com/albums/x404/WiegandGraphics/anws-instal.png[/IMG]\r\nTo Install simply use the NMM or Drop the files into you Skyrim Data folder, be warned you need the Required files in order for this mod to work correctly.\r\n[IMG]http://i1180.photobucket.com/albums/x404/WiegandGraphics/anws-Reqfiles.png[/IMG]\r\n[color=lightblue,2,300]Black and Gold Elven Equipment[/color]\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6524\r\n\r\nI do not take credit for Shodan44\\'s Work. Shodan44 did the textures for the Black/Gold Elven Armor, I simply added a tweaked Ebony Mail effect to them and some other items/weapons to match with it.\r\n\r\n[color=lightblue,2,300]Note: The Ebony Mail will no longer have any visual effects on it.[/color]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1180.photobucket.com/albums/x404/WiegandGraphics/anws-mods.png[/IMG]\r\n[color=lightblue,2,300]Black and Gold Elven Equipment[/color]\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6524\r\n[color=lightblue,2,300]Winter is Coming - Cloaks[/color]\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13486\r\n[color=lightblue,2,300]No Helmets Required[/color]\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2460\r\n[color=lightblue,2,300]Better Vampires[/color]\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9717\r\n[color=lightblue,2,300]Wanderers Hoods[/color]\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15197\r\n[color=lightblue,2,300]Bandolier - Bags and Pouches[/color]\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=16438",
