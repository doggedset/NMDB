  "descriptionHtml": "The Dokkalfar assassin, Alyn Shir, is cunning and tricky. A Dokkalfar is what Nirn-dwellers call a Dark Elf. She is dangerously beautiful and has a silver tongue, she utilizes them with lethal efficiency. When diplomacy fails, she carries two daggers to flay her enemies to bits. \n<br />\n<br />   ﻿The mods used for her creation were KS Hairdos- Lite and CBBE, all fine touches made in RaceMenu. \n<br />\n<br />   ﻿If you're a fan of the game as I am, and should you decide to roleplay as this fine character. Here are a few suggestions:\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿-Dual Wield Daggers\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿-Sneak and Speechcraft\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿-Light Armor (of course)\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿-Invisibility Potions/Spell (choice Alchemy or Illusion)\n<br />\n<br />   This mod was inspired by \"jmenaru's Alyn Shir Armor - CBBEv3 - UNP - UNP - BBP\".\n<br />\n<br /> ﻿If you like the preset and would like to see any other Skyrim adaptations of fictional characters, comment and/or endorse this mod. (Preferably both)",
