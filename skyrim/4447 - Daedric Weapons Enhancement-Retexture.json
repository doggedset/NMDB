  "descriptionHtml": "I was somewhat dissatisfied with the Daedric Weapons \\'look\\', so I decided to recolor them a litle to suit my taste.  \r\n\r\nDarkened the \\'vein\\' backgrounds so that the \\'veins\\' stand out nicely when turning the weapons\r\n\r\nAdded some minor gold work here and there.  Nothing major or overboard.\r\n\r\nDarkened and recolored the grips (these just seemed too light to me)\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt at releasing a \\'public\\' mod, so I hope everyone can forgive any issue that crop up.",
