  "summary": "Dark Brother hood armor with Poison Cloak Effect (Ebony Mail).  When in sneak mode youll be covered by blackness and smoke.  ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Place in your data folder just like most other mods.  Armor is fully upgradeable and is obtained by crafting.  Look for it in the MISC section of any Blacksmiths Forge.  Id like to find a way to copy the existing armor but use a different texture for this specific set without overriding the Dark Brotherhood armor.  If anyone knows how to do this let me know.  Thanks guys.",
