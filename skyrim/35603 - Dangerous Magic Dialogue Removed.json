  "modName": "Dangerous Magic Dialogue Removed",
  "summary": "Removed comments such as \\\"That spell looks dangerous. Keep your distance!\\\" from the game entirely.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Did you make the mistake of casting a spell at the beginning of the game or have the audacity to apply some form of magic to yourself and now the denizens of Skyrim wont stop harassing you about it twenty hours later?\r\n\r\n\\\"That spell looks dangerous. Keep your distance!\\\"\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re at all like me that single line of dialogue has driven you madder than Sheogorath. But fear not, for I have a solution! /grand standing\r\n\r\nOkay, this is just a simple little esp file that entirely removes all dialogue about dangerous spells from the game. You\\'ll now enjoy a Skyrim where every single NPC does not comment about whatever spells or magical effects your are using. Your sanity can thank me later.\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod so let me know what your think. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-Installation-\r\n\r\nShould work with NMM fine but if not just extract the NoMoreDangerousMagicDialogue.esp file to your Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-Compatibility-\r\n\r\nShould be compatible with all mods and all versions of Skyrim. Still, best to put this as low in your load order as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-Version History-\r\n\r\nv1.0 - Uploaded to Nexus 05/04/2013\r\nv1.1 - Removed further dialogue made by NPC\\'s in relation to the player\\'s magic/magic effects. 08/14/2013",
