  "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever been to the College of Winterhold and thought, &#39;This is nice, but it lacks a certain flair&#33;&#39; then this is the mod for you&#33; Â I (MrRedMarshmallow) have made some simple, yet quite effective additions to the courtyard of the College of Winterhold that adds a whole new atmosphere to the lovely mage school&#33; Now, you can study in the quiet sitting area, admire the beautiful flora of the Botanical Walkway, or possibly attend a lecture in the new Lecture Area&#33; The College has never looked so beautiful.\r<br />\r<br />If you&#39;re wondering, then yes, this is Lore-Friendly. I only upload Lore-Friendly mods. Maybe you are thinking, &#39;If the Nords dislike the Mages so much, then maybe that&#39;s why the College was so bare in the first place&#33;&#39; Well in my opinion, the Mages are much more crafty and would never need the permission of the Nords to make a beautiful place for magic students to study&#33; So yes, this mod is Lore-Friendly and the best part is that it does [i]not [/i]require any other mods or DLC to work&#33; Just the Vanilla Skyrim&#33; Enjoy&#33;",
