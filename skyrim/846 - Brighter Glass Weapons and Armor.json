  "descriptionHtml": "A project undertaken with the intent of cleansing the washed-out, desaturated gray tones from glass armor and weapons. Makes them brighter and lends more of a marbled green and blue look, like real-world malachite.\r\n\r\nThe change is subtle, but noticeable -- this is a mod for those who want more vivid glass without altogether changing the look of it.\r\n\r\nThough only the male armor and the longsword are shown, this applies to all glass weapons and armor, of both male and female phenotypes.\r\n\r\nI made this for myself and a few friends after we agreed that the glass items in Skyrim were drab and washed-out compared to Morrowind and Oblivion. This mod attempts to counteract that, while retaining the character of the newfangled item appearances to some degree. Enjoy!",
