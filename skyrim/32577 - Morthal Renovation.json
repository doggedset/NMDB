  "descriptionHtml": "-v0.3 coming soon to fix bookshelves in Mistwater, and add 3 guards to the gates\r\n-v0.2 added, more changes to come\r\n-Creation Kit (CK) fixed and v0.2 will be added shortly\r\n-New Pictures added!\r\n\r\nDo you think Morthal is a pathetic excuse for a hold capital but think it has potential? Do you want a mod to add the necessities of a town but keep the same feel? Do you like Morthal Redone but think its too extensive for a capital so close to solitude?\r\n\r\nYou have come to the right place.\r\n_____________            \r\n/\\\\/\\\\ ( ) R I /\\\\ I__\r\nR 3 I\\\\I ( ) \\\\/ /\\\\ I 3 D\r\n_____________________\r\nThis does all that in a way that I think Morthal should have been originally,\r\nThis mod adds:\r\n -A wall similar to Falkreath or Riverwood with tapestries, gates, and gate torches\r\n -A general store to the building called Thaumaturgist\\'s Hut which I like to call the Morthal Mall. It takes up the top floor and remodels it so that it looks like a general store\r\n -Adds a new NPC argonian named, appropiately, Likes-To-Sell who has a daily routine of going between the tavern and his store from 8 to 10, in which time he sells his wares. He has a relationship as Derkeethus\\'s cousin and is the argonian from the loading screen.\r\n -Adds a forge, tanning rack, and grindstone to the guard house exterior \r\n -Adds a house called Mistwater in a place which looks like it should be there\r\n\r\n.............a)Mistwater comes with Navmesh so should allow followers (does not will add v0.4)\r\n.............b)Adds an alchemy station and Enchanting station\r\n.............c)Adds 4 divine shrines and a nicely placed shrine to Nocturnal\r\n.............d)Adds cooking pot, bed, safe containers, displays, and shelves\r\n.............e)WARNING: displays do not yet work nor do bookshelves, (fixed in v0.3)\r\n............f)Awesome interior decorating in my opinion because of the basement alcove (refer to pic!) \r\n\r\n -Adds a workbench to Mistwater exterior\r\n -Adds a shrine to Talos In the corner of the city, behind Mistwater\r\n\r\nThis mod works well with the normal routine and quests of the people of Morthal and I recommend adding Lesser Hold Stables:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16713\r\nDrinking fountains of skyrim:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24282\r\nAnd carts in each big town:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8434\r\nSee my other mod The Adventurers Camps which is compatible:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32296/\r\n\r\nCompatability: Should work with most mods but those which adds anything where the wall or forge is. Will test various mods: \r\nMorthal Redone - no\r\nMorthal Legacy - no, the player home conflicts with the East wall\r\nEnhanced Cities Morthal - yes (so far) and recommended, though youll have two forges haha!\r\nMorthal player home - no \r\nMorthal\\'s Ghastly Mine - yes\r\nMorthal Hall - eh, no but so close if you want it, just delete the workbench and grindstone from his or the barrels and forge from mine\r\nMorthal Fortified - no\r\nAnd last but not least,\r\nJarl goat of Morthal - yes haha of course!\r\n___________________________________________\r\n\r\nupgrade: just pull everything out of Mistwater and uninstall, then install V0.2\r\n___________________________________________\r\nFuture upgrades: Housecarl Marissa Bearheart  \r\n                         Make it a thane house \r\n                         Add a guard to the wall (v0.4)\r\n                         fix Mistwater   \r\n                         Add a shrine to Arkay and a priest of Arkay \r\n\r\nThank you and please, Comment and add suggestions on anything you would like to see in Morthal and ill see what i can do!",
