  "descriptionHtml": "I was sick of getting bit by a wolf, contracting rockjoint, and crawling my cripple ass all the way to Whiterun for healing. I thought that Gerdur\\'s ties to the Stormcloaks would justify her having a shrine to Talos in her house. Stendarr was added just in case you weren\\'t allowed in Gerdur\\'s house or have a problem with Talos...Elven jerks...\r\n\r\nThis mod adds: Talos shrine to Gerdur\\'s house on the counter. / Stendarr shrine to The Sleeping Giant Inn on the bar counter.\r\n                       \r\n",
