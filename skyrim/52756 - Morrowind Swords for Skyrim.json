The store owner had no sooner bought these weapons before being slaughtered by bandits who made off with the weapons.\r<br />\r<br />A few years later these bandits had gone from footpads to Lords of their own bandit clans in neighboring Cyrodil. There they were one by one slain by the future Champion of Cyrodil.\r<br />\r<br />After the CoC went missing, presumed dead...or insane. The swords were recovered by various people following the dawn of the Fourth Era. The Great War broke out and some of the swords were lost with there masters, while others found new masters or there old masters fled.\r<br />\r<br />Now at the end of the world, these swords call out to be found.
