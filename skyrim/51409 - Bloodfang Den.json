  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u]About[/u][/b]\r<br />This mod is a small Vampire themed home hidden in the back of a small cave. My goal was to try and keep it lore friendly and discreet, and not stray too far from how vampires are typically portrayed within Skyrim. It was designed with my own vampire character in mind, but hopefully someone else out there will find that it suits them too. This was my first ever mod, and I&#39;m quite happy with how it turned out. Hopefully it won&#39;t be my last, and I&#39;ve still got a couple of plans for this mod too. I hope you enjoy, and let me know if you have any problems or suggestions. I&#39;ll do my best to act quickly. \r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Video[/u][/b]\r<br />[youtube]uXYZ9CkfB4g[/youtube]\r<br />Big thanks to izon87604 for the video&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]This house features:[/u][/b]\r<br />- A coffin for one vampire\r<br />- Two beds for followers\r<br />- Several bookshelves\r<br />- Enchanting and alchemy crafting stations\r<br />- A moderate amount of storage\r<br />- Three display cases; one large and two small\r<br />- A weapon plaque\r<br />- Two mannequins\r<br />- A very simple exterior (no unwanted attention&#33;)\r<br />- Plenty of darkness\r<br />- A thrall for feeding inside a &#39;secret&#39; room\r<br />- A shrine to Molag Bal\r<br />- Smithing facilities\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]My plans for the mod are:[/u][/b] \r<br />- To iron out bugs and make other improvements \r<br />- To add an optional version with smithing facilities (DONE)\r<br />- Make it so that the shrine actually does something (DONE)\r<br />- Think of a better name for the place (DONE)\r<br />- A Dawnguard only version, as requested (DONE)\r<br />- To add a couple of optional npc&#39;s to occupy those beds \r<br />\r<br />[b][u]To use the mod, you&#39;ll need:[/u][/b]\r<br />- A functioning PC\r<br />- A legit copy of Skyrim\r<br />- Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn. (A Dawnguard Only version is available)\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Credits and Thank You&#39;s:[/u][/b]\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2250922/?]Blary[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2235573/?]Oaristys[/url] for their excellent modders resources.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/6406513/?]Petemichaelbabicki[/url] for inspiring me with the excellent Frostfang Coven mod.\r<br />- Jonas for testing.\r<br />- Dan for telling me how to do screenshots.\r<br />- Bethesda for the game.\r<br />- The Nexus guys for the awesome site.\r<br />- The many people doing creation kit tutorials for helping idiots like me.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Changes[/u][/b]\r<br />V1.1\r<br />- Changed Navmesh to allow npc&#39;s to enter the house and move around the bookshelves\r<br />- Changed several doors to open to the inside, to reduce hall blocking\r<br />\r<br />V1.2\r<br /> - Changed the download file to include a .bsa rather than two folders of loose textures and meshes. Hopefully that worked (most other mods do that, I&#39;m just a n00b). \r<br />\r<br />V1.2a (Dawnguard Version)\r<br />- Version that only requires Dawnguard. Hearthfire Oven removed from kitchen, and Dragonborn secret stone door replaced with a regular portcullis. \r<br />\r<br />V1.3 \r<br />- Made most of the lights brighter. On normal settings, it was a bit too dark. \r<br />- Changed the entrance significantly. A magic shrine opens the door instead of an obvious pullchain. Reduced the amount of lights and made it look a bit nicer. The pullchain on the inside has been replaced with a pullbar in the same place. \r<br />- The shrine in the hidden room works. Grants &#39;Blessing of Molag Bal&#39; which applies a 10% damage increase to Destruction Spells for 12 hours. (I chose destruction because Vampiric Drain is classed as a destruction spell). Will continue to tweak this amount if it is deemed overpowered or underpowered. \r<br />- Changed the prisoner in the secret room from a generic Castle Thrall to a custom made npc called &#39;Captured Bandit&#39;. \r<br />- Added a little more clutter and tweaked Navmesh to match. \r<br />- Removed the door to the kitchen, it blocked the way too much. \r<br />- Changed the name from &#34;Hidden Vampire Den&#34; or whatever it was to &#34;Bloodfang Den&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />V1.3a (Dawnguard Version)\r<br />- Fixed the portcullis to the secret room. When updating the mod, I had forgotten that there was even supposed to be a portcullis there, and then also forgot to connect it to the pullbar.\r<br />\r<br />V1.3b (Dawnguard Version)\r<br />- Fixed another dumb mistake&#33; Forgot to export facegen data, so the Captured Bandit had a different skin tone on her face then the rest of her.\r<br />\r<br />V1.4\r<br />- Smithing version is now here&#33; Added an extra cavern to the home that contains; Smelter, Forge, Tanning Rack, Workbench, Sharpening Wheel, Weapon Racks and Storage.\r<br />- Navmeshed the new area. It&#39;s a little tight in places but everyone is able to move around. Let me know if there are any issues.\r<br />\r<br />V1.4a (Dawnguard Version)\r<br />- A Dawnguard Only version with the smithing facilities.\r<br />\r<br />Misc\r<br />- Added new screenshots and updated description. Screenshots were all taken in the full version. Some things may change depending on the version you use.\r<br />\r<br />V1.4b (All Versions)\r<br />- Updated the BSA files, so more things should be displayed. Dumb mistake on my part with not keeping on top of that&#33;",
