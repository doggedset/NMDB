  "descriptionHtml": "[b]**REQUIRES THE DRAGONBORN DLC TO FUNCTION**[/b]\r\n\r\nThis is just a simple little fix for a problem, that has been causing me to loose immersion in the game. I guessed that I am not the only one, who does not like the idea of having to loot your Great House\\'s robes from someone else, so I decided to make this little mod and share it.\r\n\r\n[b]WHAT THIS MOD DOES[/b]\r\n- It makes the following items purchasable from Neloth in Tel Mithryn (prices with no speech perks): [list]\r\n[*] Unenchanted Telvanni Robes (209 septims),\r\n[*] Unenchanted Telvanni Shoes (34 septims),\r\n[*] Telvanni Robes enchanted with the regular (but just a tad more powerful) enchantment (419 septims),\r\n[*] Telvanni Robes with the same enchantment as the Arch Mage\\'s robes (7603 septims),\r\n[*] Telvani Shoes, with a shock resistance enchantment (2558 septims)[/list]\r\n\r\n- And the following from Fethis in Raven Rock (prices with no speech perks):\r\n[list][*] Dunmer outfit (enchanted, various colours, with or without the hood) (225 septims),\r\n[*] Dunmer shoes (enchanted) (70 septims)[/list]",
