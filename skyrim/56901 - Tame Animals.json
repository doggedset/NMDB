  "descriptionHtml": "Ever wanted to set up a farm? Wanted to have wolves and chickens, without having a bloodbath? Been interested to see bunnies take over Whiterun? Or wanted to dress up the Stormcloack halls with some tame bears?\r<br />Now you can&#33;\r<br />\r<br />An old farmer, who lived near Silent Moons Camp, spent most of his life researching animals. He finally learned how to summon and tame them. If you find his books, you can be master of the animals as well. \r<br />\r<br />The animals are quite tame, and will not attack the player, if he is not attacking them. They will also not flee. Next to that, they will also leave each other alone. \r<br />They will attack those that are hostile (like wild wolves or bandits).\r<br />\r<br />====================== DAWNGUARD VERSION ========================\r<br />The Dawnguard Version changes two things. \r<br />First of all, it adds new animals like the Vale Deer and Sabre Cat, the Gargoyle and more. \r<br />Second of all, it changes the behaviour of the tame animals. The animals will not attack each-other, nor will they attack other neutral NPCs and animals. If you are attacked, however, they will defend you. They will also defend each-other. In the original version, they only defended themselves.\r<br />\r<br />If there are animals you miss, let me know and I will add them&#33;",
