  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds in an alchemy lab and enchanting table as part of the Loft Decorations addition to Breezehome, so that you can have an alchemy lab and a child's room at the same time. The Enchanter is not the standard one found everywhere else in Skyrim, but is one that has less of a dark or evil appearance, inspired by the one seen in The Elder Scrolls Online Gathering and Exploration trailer. \r\n\r\nNote: Although this is meant for Hearthfire, it does not require it. It also does not remove any containers or objects, so whatever you have stored should still be safe. When loading this mod for the first time, it is not recommended that you load a save that is already in Breezehome.",
