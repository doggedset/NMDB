I got annoyed that there wasnt a fix out there for female characters, so modified scepths fix to work for both males and females. All credits go to Scepth as all i did was duplicate and rename the files. Hope this helps others.  Must be used with Creasta&#39;s Female Glove Fix and obviously Halfdead&#39;s Better Shrouded Armor",
