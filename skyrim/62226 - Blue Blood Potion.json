It is a small part of a much larger project that I am working on, but I often find myself looking for resources that I can use, so in the spirit of sharing, here it is. Anyone is free to use this recolour, but please give me credit. It is for use in the CK and does not contain any files that will go into your game unless you use the model as part of your own creation.\r<br />\r<br />You will need the Ellodlc01bloodpotion.nif file in the meshes, because the colour change is done inside the .nif file, not a texture file. The texture file removes some of the red tint from the ornate designs on the bottle.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#fc9b03][size=4][b]Installation and Requirements[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />Dawnguard is required, extract the files to your Skyrim/Data folder.",
