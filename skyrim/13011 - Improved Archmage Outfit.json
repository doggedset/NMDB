  "summary": "Replacement for Archmage\\'s robes and boots. The robes change from 15% to 25% reduced cost and boots had enchantment removed.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a personal file I am going to share with anyone who wants it like I did. What I did was I changed the Archmage Robes to give 25% reduction to all magic school costs, up from 15%. I made this because I like the look and wanted to make it compatible with enchanting your costs down so you can reach 100% while using them. I also removed the enchantment on the Archmage\\'s boots as well, the 40% lightning resist ones you find in the archmages chambers. So that you can outfit them with your own enchantments. This mod replaces the items in game and are not their own standalone so anything that modifies them shouldn\\'t be compatible. Enjoy.\r\n\r\nNote: If you were using the robes prior to installing this mod, you must unequip and reequip them for the new values to take effect.",
