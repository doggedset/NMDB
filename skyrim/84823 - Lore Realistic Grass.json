Get it. Made for the Legendary Edition.[/color][/font]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/84887/?]More Grass[/url]\r<br />\r<br />A few years ago I made for myself the texture of grass in the Skyrim Legendary Edition. It was from despair. \r<br />Because all the grass that I found was either not too lorn, or had a mapping problem. I can not accept the amorphous \r<br />projection, the liquid grass that does not look like a physical object (With ENB) ... \r<br />And so, I put them on the &#34;Special Edition&#34; and was amazed at how well it looks there.\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]guHB2VSNwf0[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[i][u][b]Do not expect much from this herb.[/b][/u][/i]\r<br />Most textures have a Vanilla resolution of 512x512.\r<br />This is NOT insanely beautiful grass texture in HD. And only the creation of a composition of the general background and atmosphere.\r<br />Maud does not change the arrangement of the grass, does not add more grass.\r<br />For that, they can not affect the performance.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Compatible with any fashion for: increasing the amount of grass, increasing the size of grass.\r<br />It is not compatible with any grass mods that do not replace grass textures, but add their own grass (removing vanilla from the game).[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[i][u][b]As for the ghostly display of grass:[/b][/u][/i]\r<br />I made a greater contrast care in dark colors. This allows the grass to be brighter in sunny weather and darker to overcast.\r<br />Added to each texture a diffuse map of normals. Only this allows it to be displayed correctly.\r<br />The whole grass responds correctly to the lighting, and correctly casts a shadow.\r<br />This is true for Skyrim LE with ENB, and for Special Edition even without ENB.\r<br />Weight NormalMap small - almost all 170kb. Therefore, they will not add a noticeable load.\r<br />\r<br />[i][u][b]I spread 2 versions (light and dark).[/b][/u][/i]\r<br />I do not know yet who will be more suitable.\r<br />The ENB has too much influence on the display. Even the palette radically changes its appearance.\r<br />For SE, I had to make the trunk lighter, the shading was too strong.\r<br />On LE, I use a very bright ENB, so only dark grass is normally displayed in it without Ambient Occlusion.\r<br />If you are the same luminous maniac, like me, only dark grass will suit you)))\r<br />\r<br />In comments you can write - that you liked or did not like. What is missing is this grass. This is the initial version.\r<br />And I want to improve it in the future.\r<br />\r<br />[i][u][b]NOTE:[/b][/u][/i]\r<br />I myself created these textures, except one.\r<br />The texture of the fern in Pineforest. It plays a very important role in the composition of this region.\r<br />But .. I have it, at least, from 2013g. I just do not remember where I got it.\r<br />If you know from what mod this texture is - let me know.\r<br />I want to know if I can use it. Or do I need permission to use it.\r<br />That everything was done correctly.\r<br />\r<br />[u][i][b]Installation:[/b][/i][/u]\r<br />So far without NMM.\r<br />Just put the contents of the archive in the folder with the game.
