You may have to use pageup to find their name)[/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=6]STEP 3.[/size]  Use one of the 3 commands below:\r<br />bat setfriend\r<br />bat setmarry\r<br />bat divorce\r<br />\r<br />[size=6]STEP 4.[size=2]  EXIT from the console window by hitting your [b]TILDE[/b] [size=5]~[/size][/size][/size]\r<br />\r<br />After you use bat setfriend, when you talk to the npc altered--the commands &#34;Follow me, I need your help.&#34; and probably, &#34;Interested in me, are you?&#34;(Provided you are wearing Mara&#39;s Amulet) all should come up as options.  \r<br />(Make sure you exit out of any active or current dialogue and allow the commands to be added.  Also, depending on who you are befriending, you may have to re-sheath your weapon to make them stop attacking, if they were once your enemy.)\r<br />For Divorce, same deal, target the married NPC in console, use &#39;bat divorce&#39; command, wait 24hours and you should then be able to remarry someone else.\r<br />To ensure a &#34;stable marriage&#34; where you aren&#39;t considered a thief in someone&#39;s home, it is highly recommended to use a default player home like Breezehome, or one of the millions of player home mods.\r<br />Bear in mind when choosing the home you will live in after the service, depending on who you marrying.   ie:  If you marry a Jarl of say.. Dawnstar, where that NPC normally resides will be his/her home, and most likely--because that is not considered a &#34;player home&#34;, belongings and items will NOT change in ownership, (without you manually setting ownership, via console commands.)\r<br />[b]&gt;&gt;&gt;  UPDATE FOR UFO USERS&#33;&#33;[/b]\r<br />add the following line to the bottom of the other commands in your setfriend.txt and setmarry.txt\r<br />&#34; set playerfollowercount to 0 &#34; (withOUT the quotes)\r<br />\r<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/kgV55t][img]https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3669/12650880683_784d02d043_c.jpg[/img][/url][size=4]\r<br />\r<br />[size=2][size=4]--[b]How To Uninstall[/b]--[/size]\r<br />Delete all the files that were included in the original .7zip from within your Skyrim folder and your /Skyrim/data folder. \r<br /> BE WARNED of unstable saves if you had any random NPCs that you turned into followers who are normally NOT followers, and they most likely will disappear.  HIGHLY recommended to rollback to an earlier save if possible.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />--[b]Tips For Marrying Aggressive or &#34;Angry&#34; NPCs[/b]--[/size]\r<br />Recently I came across an issue where a Forsworn Ravager I had proposed to, went on a killing spree at the Temple of Mara when it was time for us to be wed.  Upon entering the temple, the dialogue came up &#34;here is the blushing bride now...&#34; and I was frozen, while my husband-to-be proceeded to slaughter everyone attending our wedding...\r<br /> Here is my solution/workaround:\r<br /> 1.  Use Amazing Follower Tweaks mod--as listed below in the compatible mod section.\r<br /> 2.  Keep your aggressive follower/husband or bride-to-be AS a follower.\r<br /> 3.  In Amazing Follower Tweaks, use the command:  Tweak Options&gt;Settings&gt;&#34;Followers Never Initiate Combat&#34;.\r<br /> 4.  Enter Temple, proceed with wedding as usual.\r<br /> 5.  In towns with your aggressive husband or wife,  THIS WILL MOST LIKELY HAPPEN... If you part   ways, they will begin attacking anyone they see.  This is basically unavoidable, my recommendation is to just keep them as your follower until you are back in your home with them, and they should behave normally.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]--HIGHLY [b]Recommended Mods (But not required) That Work Well With This[/b]--[/size]\r<br />Amazing Follower Tweaks by Dheuster-is HIGHLY recommended:\r<br />     [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15524/]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15524/[/url]\r<br />Multiple Marriages-Spouse Dress Up-Rehousing-And More by Dudestia:\r<br />     [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9378/]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9378/[/url]\r<br />Convenient Horses by Alek: \r<br />     [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14950/]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14950/[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]--[b]Known Conflicts/Issues/Bugs[/b]--[/size][b]\r<br />VOICES[/b]--gonna be right up front with you, the author is continuing to work with this mod, but for now here&#39;s the issue:  There are still some NPCs (mainly males) that will NOT have all of their spoken dialogue for certain commands.  It may at times reduce or eliminate some spoken dialogue of people that are vanilla followers.  To be honest a lot of the usual NPC followers are far too chatty when I&#39;m trying to be stealthy in a dungeon or cave anyways, so this doesn&#39;t bother me in the least.  My personal experience I would say about 90% of the NPCs that I take on, still have most--if not ALL spoken dialogue in tact.\r<br />[b]CLOTHING[/b]--I haven&#39;t personally had this issue but the author has warned me that sometimes after you make someone a follower the chosen NPC may lose their clothes, or unequip them.  (Again, this wouldn&#39;t bother me too much, even if it did happen I have spare armor on me for days..) \r<br />[b]ESSENTIAL NPC WARNING[/b]--If you DO decide to make an Essential NPC your follower/marriagable, depending on where you are in the war storyline or any other storyline for that matter, there may be some issues.  (I personally have not had any issues with this yet.)  Just be for-warned and use your best judgement there.  (At the very least you can reload a save, send &lt;Name of NPC&gt; back to their city, and proceed with the quests.)\r<br />[b]RANDOM GENERATED NPCS[/b]--If you&#39;re anything like me, and happen to come across a lady or gentleman caller out in the field, you may want to marry them.   \r<br />Feel free to do so, just be warned, if you are not using Multiple Marriages-Spouse Dress Up-Rehousing-And More by Dudestia there is a very good chance after they have moved into your home that they will run off, disappear, or change into someone or someTHING else...  \r<br />I have firsthand experience with this, let me tell you.. and it is not uncommon to marry a forsworn ravager and weeks later, find a Hilltroll Goblin from the Monster Mod, in your master bedroom.  This happened to me on The Asteria, ended up having to &#34;clean house&#34; and dump the bodies overboard. XD  \r<br />The only real guarantee that they will stay around, and not change into someone else, is to have them permanently follow you.  \r<br />Another thing I&#39;ve noticed, if I befriend/marry a bandit, and later on while questing: come across another bandit who looks exactly like the one I married, they end up being &#34;essential&#34; and are unable to be killed.  The only thing that resolves this is to target the un-killable NPC in console (verify it&#39;s the correct target please... with showinventory, and check the name--don&#39;t delete land or something you didn&#39;t want to delete.) and markfordelete them. \r<br />Sorry there is no other real solutions that I know of for these issues because this is just how the game functions, that&#39;s the risk you take when marrying a random generated NPC&#33;  \r<br />\r<br />[url=https://flic.kr/p/jMLQdX][img]https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3834/12332411295_fff6ace6e8_c.jpg[/img][/url]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]--[b]Saftey Tip[/b]--[/size]\r<br />[b]&lt;&lt;  SAVE OFTEN&#33; &gt;&gt;[/b]\r<br />DON&#39;T PANIC IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG.
