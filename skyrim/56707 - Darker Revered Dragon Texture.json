  "summary": "A modified texture for Dawnguard&#39;s Revered Dragons, with darker colors.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Of all the dragons of Skyrim, the Revered Dragons, in my opinion, look the coolest.\r<br />[i]Well[/i]...that said, all of the ones I&#39;ve fought looked very garish to me, and I always find myself distracted by their bright orange skin and glazed eyes. I mean, they look fine on Solstheim, or on a cloudy day, but if the sunlight is bright, or you&#39;re fighting by torchlight they look like they&#39;re made of Play-Doh.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is based on the native 1024 X 2048 textures from Dawnguard.\r<br />All I did was lower the brightness and mess with the contrast using Photoshop, so if someone wanted to make a higher resolution version, they should be my guest, because[i][b] I&#39;m not going to bother with one&#33;[/b][/i]\r<br />\r<br />Is this mod for everybody? No. I&#39;m not holding a gun to your head forcing you to download it.\r<br />Does the default texture look fine? Of course it does. Again, you don&#39;t have to download this if you don&#39;t want to. I just figured some other folks had a similar feeling about the Revered Dragons&#39; texture that I figured I&#39;d share this. Cool? Cool.\r<br />\r<br />I made this mod while working on my main project, [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40615/]Relics of Hyrule[/url], and as such I&#39;ve also made another texture for the Revered Dragons that make them look like a certain fiery dragon from the Legend of Zelda universe. I offer that as an alternate texture. I find it makes the Revered Dragons look as though they are made of lava, which is a nice aesthetic.\r<br />I thought I might as well share it for those who may be interested.\r<br />As it happens, this mod was released before the update for Relics of Hyrule that features Volvagia, so consider this a sneak-preview of sorts&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />P.S. That Dwarven Ruin in the Retexture screenshot is Itnamzand from Relics of Hyrule. Just so you know.",
