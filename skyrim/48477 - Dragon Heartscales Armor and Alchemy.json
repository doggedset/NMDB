  "descriptionHtml": "Dragon Heartscales have Value&#33;  Version 1.2\r<br />\r<br />[i]Kindly Endorse/Rate if you use this mod in your game, please. Thanks&#33;&#33;[/i]\r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod, and a very BIG thanks to Sir Edhelsereg&#33;&#33; I mean it, we&#39;ve gotten to be good friends. I also ENCOURAGE you all to check out his Mods. He has some very excellent Mods to share&#33;\r<br />\r<br />So Dragon Heartscale Have Value? How?\r<br />\r<br />This mod makes it so you can create powerful Dragon Heartscale Arrows, but they are NOT cheap and you only get 5 per Dragon Heartscale.\r<br />\r<br />... You also need Kahvozein&#39;s Fang to harvest the Scales. \r<br />See: http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Kahvozein&#39;s_Fang \r<br />\r<br />You have to have the: \r<br />\r<br />&gt;&gt;[b][i] DRAGON SMITHING PERK TO CREATE THESE.[/i][/b] for obvious reasons. &lt;&lt;&lt;\r<br />\r<br />The cost to create the Dragon Heartscale Arrows?\r<br />1 – Dragon Heartscale\r<br />1 – Ebony Ingot\r<br />1 – Silver Ingot\r<br />1 – Fire Salts\r<br />1 – Frost Salts\r<br />1 – Daedra Heart\r<br />\r<br />You get 5 Dragon Heartscale Arrows with a Damage of 50. These are not your vanilla Skyrim Arrows&#33; They came from the Heartscales of a Dragon&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Yes, 50 and here is why: You went through Dragon Attacks, Dragon Priest Attacks, Fire and Frost and Blood, Sweat and tears to get those Dragon Heartscales&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Unlike Jarrin Root, where a gal dressed in Leather just gave one to you. \r<br />\r<br />It’s not as powerful as Jarrin Root, but dang close, which brings me to the other use for Dragon Heartscales&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Another Thanks to: Bluarchon and yes check out his Mods too. He gave me the ‘focal point’ of how to create: Dragon Heartscale Ash, an Alchemy agent. \r<br />\r<br />Originally I was going to do this at a MILL, but realized just how few they are and that would just be ‘annoying’ to me as a player. So the Smelter was the next best call ….\r<br />\r<br />The Dragon Heartscale Alchemy Agent does the following:\r<br />\r<br />[b]DAMAGE HEALTH[/b] – just a tad less than Jarrin Root, but just as DEADLY&#33;\r<br />[b]RESIST FROST[/b] - Almost Dragon Strength, but not quite.\r<br />[b]RESIST FIRE[/b] - Almost Dragon Strength, but not quite.\r<br />[b]DAMAGE MAGICA.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]ADDED: 12/07/2013[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Dragon Heartscale Arrow Tips now [i]glow[/i] – so they are hopefully easier to find.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Dragon Heartscale Ring of Protection:[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />This ring protects you from 75% damage protection from Fire and Frost Attacks, but again – This RING is not cheap and thus makes it worth it. \r<br />\r<br />&gt;&gt; You NEED Dragon Armor Smithing Perk to Make this.\r<br />\r<br />INGREDIENTS:\r<br />1 – Dragon Heartscale Ash\r<br />1 – Dragon’s Tongue\r<br />1 – Fire Salts\r<br />1 – Frost Salts\r<br />1 – Gold Ingot\r<br />1 – GRAND Soul Gem &gt;FILLED&lt;\r<br />1 – Slaughter Fish Scales\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Dragon Heartscale Light Shield of Protection:[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />This Shield, like the Ring, offers 75/75 from Fire and Frost attacks, but like the Ring and the Arrows – it does not come cheap&#33; \r<br />\r<br />You need the DRAGON ARMOR PERK to make this shield.\r<br />\r<br />1 – Dragon Heartscale Ash\r<br />1 – Dragon’s Tongue\r<br />1 – Ebony Ingot\r<br />1 – Fire Salts\r<br />1 – Frost Salts\r<br />1 – GRAND Soul Gem &gt;FILLED&lt;\r<br />1 – Leather Strips\r<br />1 – Slaughter Fish Scales\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]To Do:[/u][/b]\r<br />As I grow in my Mod Creation Experience, I will create a special Arrow and Shield for this. Right now I just used the Daedric Arrow to get this Mod going.\r<br />\r<br />Also might create: Armor and Weapons *IF* there is enough Endorsements to call for the commitment to &#39;go there&#39; ...\r<br />\r<br />I did my best to keep this “Lore Friendly” and balanced as is possible.\r<br />\r<br />Again –\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to: \r<br />[b][i]Sir Edhelsereg[/i][/b] \r<br />http://steamcommunity.com/id/sir_edhelsereg/myworkshopfiles/?appid=72850\r<br />\r<br />[b][i]Bluarchon[/i][/b] \r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/searchresults/?src_order=1&src_sort=0&src_view=2&src_tab=1&src_auth=Bluarchon&src_showadult=1&page=1&pUp=1\r<br />\r<br />Also A Thanks to [b][i]Gillan2020[/i][/b] - for the Name Change Idea. It made more sense to give it a clearer description&#33; \r<br />... Thanks Gillan&#33;&#33; Also check out his mods&#33; \r<br />\r<br />http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198072972663/myworkshopfiles/ \r<br />\r<br />…. and again, follow the links and CHECK OUT THESE GUYS MODS&#33;&#33; Please.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating such a great game SKYRIM&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Hope you all enjoy it.\r<br />\r<br />… Jj …\r<br />",
