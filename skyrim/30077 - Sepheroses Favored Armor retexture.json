  "descriptionHtml": "Update: Thanks to Pronam, I now have an awesome specular and normal map, so just grab the new file and overwrite, and enjoy. Pictures won\\'t do it justice, but the colors are more vibrant and the metal plates look amazing. Also, check out the videos tab to see it in game.\r\n\r\nSo I haven\\'t done anything in a while, and another user requested a variant of a variant of the Favord Armor from user singlebelong\\'s awesome Oriental weapon and armor set. So I figured \\\"What the hey, might as well!\\\" Sadly it is currently male only, although I do intend on changing that.\r\n\r\nSo essentially what you see in the screens is what you get, although I did make a small change to the original ESP so the gauntlets show up properly for beast races, so here is what you need to do.\r\n\r\n1. Install the awesome Oriental weapon and armor set, found here: http://www.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16977\r\n\r\n2. Install this excellent retexture of the armor by Rohganictus: http://www.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29610\r\n\r\n3. Use NMM to DL and install my mediocre work over the top of the previous two as it is dependant on assets from both and allow it to overwrite.\r\n\r\nPretty simple, other than that follow the directions from the original mod to get the armor and sword.\r\n\r\nDo not Re-Up this anywhere and please ask my permission before using it in any form of compilation, if anyone has that idea. I will very likely grant it barring one thing: I do not want to see my work on the Steam Workshop. Thank you for respecting that.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use my retex as a base for your own, feel free to do so.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nsingbelong: for the original and awesome armor and weapons.\r\nRohganictus: For letting me retexture his beautiful retexture.\r\nKyuukei: For requesting this from me and giving me feedback through the entire process.\r\nPronam: For being awesome and putting the finishing touches on it where I failed.",
