  "descriptionHtml": "I find the daedric artifacts in the vanilla Skyrim to be kind of lame. I mean, what&#39;s the point of selling your soul to all those devils if the rewards they give you for it are just a bunch of crap that you could have crafted better yourself? But not anymore&#33; In this little mod I have rebalanced the daedric artifacts to be roughly 4 times as powerful as before. Now you will have a reason to go after those babies instead of just sitting on your ass grinding your enchanting and smithing skills.\r<br />\r<br />Changes:\r<br />\r<br />Azura&#39;s/Black Star:\r<br />\r<br />Value increased.\r<br />\r<br />Dawnbreaker:\r<br />\r<br />-Value increased.\r<br />-Base damage quadruplicated.\r<br />-Fire damage increased from 20 to 150.\r<br />-Now has infinite charges.\r<br />\r<br />Ebony Blade:\r<br />\r<br />-Value increased.\r<br />-Base damage quadruplicated.\r<br />-Absorb health magnitude quadruplicated.\r<br />\r<br />Ebony Mail:\r<br />\r<br />-Value increased.\r<br />-Base armor quadruplicated.\r<br />-Poison damage per second increased from 5 to 20.\r<br />\r<br />Mace of Molag Bal:\r<br />\r<br />-Value increased.\r<br />-Base damage quadruplicated.\r<br />-Enchatment changed from 25 points of damage to stamina and magicka to 100 points of absorb stamina and magicka, soul trap duration was increased from 3 seconds to a full minute.\r<br />-Now has infinite charges.\r<br />\r<br />Masque of Clavicus Bile:\r<br />\r<br />-Value increased.\r<br />-Base armor quadruplicated.\r<br />-Barter bonus increased from 20% to 80%.\r<br />-Speech bonus increased from 10% to 40%.\r<br />-Magicka regen boost increased from 5% to 20%\r<br />\r<br />Mehrunes Razor:\r<br />\r<br />-Value increased.\r<br />-Base damage quadruplicated.\r<br />-Chance of instantly killing foe increased from 1% to 5%.\r<br />\r<br />Ring of Namira:\r<br />\r<br />-Value increased.\r<br />-Standard bonus to stamina increased from 50 points to 200 points.\r<br />-Added immunity to poison and disease enchantments to it.\r<br />\r<br />Ring of Hircine:\r<br />\r<br />-Value increased.\r<br />-Added enchantment that fortifies archery and sneaking skills by a hundred percent.\r<br />\r<br />Sanguine Rose:\r<br />\r<br />-Value increased.\r<br />-Base duration of conjured Dremora increased from 60 seconds to 10 minutes.\r<br />-Now has infinite charges.\r<br />\r<br />Skull of Corruption:\r<br />\r<br />-Value increased.\r<br />-Magic damage increased from 20 to 60 in normal state and from 50 to 200 in case it is charged with dreams.\r<br />-Now has infinite charges.\r<br />\r<br />Spellbreaker:\r<br />\r<br />-Value increased.\r<br />-Base armor quadruplicated.\r<br />-Ward power increased from 50 to 200.\r<br />\r<br />Volendrung:\r<br />\r<br />-Value increased.\r<br />-Base damage quadruplicated.\r<br />-Absorb stamina effect increased from 50 to 300.\r<br />-Now has infinite charges.\r<br />\r<br />Dragonbane:\r<br />\r<br />-Base damage doubled.\r<br />-Bonus damage to dragons increased from 40 to 200 points.\r<br />-Shock damage increased from 10 to 50 points.",
