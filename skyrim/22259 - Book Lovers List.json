  "descriptionHtml": "I created this spreadsheet for a library I am creating in my house mod.  Then I expanded the list to include a \\\"Discovered\\\" checkbox column to mark which books have been found.  When a book is marked as found, it will display a column showing the known Skyrim locations for that book.  (The info is hidden by default so it won\\'t spoil it.)\r\n\r\nThe books are sorted in alphabetical order.  Books starting with \\\"The\\\" and \\\"A \\\", have been changed to \\\"<title>, The\\\" and \\\"<title>, A\\\".  \r\n\r\nFinally, there is a tab with a pivot table showing the book letter distribution analysis.  I needed this information for the library I\\'m creating in my house mod.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This spreadsheet does use code (macros)!  I needed to write code to properly show the location(s) when the checkbox is checked.   I also left in the macros that change the book titles in spreadsheet so they can be used again if needed.  \r\n",
