Really wanted the crown of Barenziah but found yourself denied the opportunity? This mod is for you! Once you complete the quest, go and visit the statue with the newly reforged crown on it. Vex has left you a nice little note...\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n\r\nYou will need 24 garnets and 2 gold ingots to craft a replica of the crown.. Once you have those items return to the crown and activate it you should then \\\"craft\\\" the crown\r\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n\r\nOn some hair meshes the hair could clip through the crown; this is just the way the crown is shaped.. you can fix this by doing \\\"showracemenu\\\" and changing your hair\r\n\r\nArgonians and khajiit characters are at the moment unable to use the crown due to different head models.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n\r\nSkyrim (of course :P )\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits/Special Thanks\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\n\r\nBethesda for skyrim ^.^\r\n\r\nGhosu - for the fantastic work on making the mesh wearable\r\nhttp://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/3297180-ghosu/\r\n\r\nDmjay - For helping with some scripting issues\r\nhttp://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/28524-dmjay/\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n\r\nyou may use this file for any mod you want as long as you give credit\r\n\r\nthis file is provided \\\"as is\\\" I am not responsible for anything that may happen from using this file (but should you encounter an issue post in the discussion and I\\'ll do my best to help you).",
