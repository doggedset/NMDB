  "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever played Skyrim? Have you ever done this and thought: \"This is great, but I wish there were moose\". Well now there are.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]This mod adds a few different spells and arrows to the game for your Moose related enjoyment:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\"Wait\" you say, \"Those are just Elk renamed as Moose\"\n<br />This is correct.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[i]- A Summon Moose Spell: Summons one moose where the caster is pointing, and simultaneously generates 4 more moose at the caster's location.\n<br />\n<br />- A 'Make Moose' Spell: Transforms (within range) any NPC the caster is pointing at into a killable moose. (Excluding Guards, Including Essential NPC's)\n<br />\n<br />- The Moose Gun: An arrow that sticks your enemies with a full sized Moose. (Great for target marking)\n<br />\n<br />- The Moose Nuke: Fear it, I do\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/i]The Moose should follow the player, it's uncertain\n<br />This is not a lore-friendly mod, just a bit of fun . Install at your own risk, I have no idea what I'm doing\n<br />\n<br />Each of these Items can be found inside a very small chest in Farengar's room in Dragonreach. The chest is on the ground to your Left when you walk in.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Warning: [/b]Sometimes enemies can get a hold of the moose nuke",
