  "summary": "Small House in Riverwood",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a small house that sits outside of Riverwood on the opposite side of the river. Its fairly basic. No scripted lights, sorting containers, or magic elves to shine your boots. I made this while fiddling around with the creation kit for my first time. If there is any issues or you like it enough to see it turned into a full mod, let me know. As of now, the interior is in good shape. It might have a few issues like containers that respawn on their own, or missing textures, so consider this an Alpha, though it shouldn&#39;t be game breaking. The exterior of the house is also crazy bland. Its a real eyesore, but if anybody was interested.\r<br />\r<br />Just to reiterate, this is ALPHA, be careful. Its probs safe to use a main save, but I&#39;d be mindful of losing things you placed inside. If you do download it, please, hit up the comments and let me know every issue (Even if its just things you want to see) you have had. It greatly helps. If there is a genuine interest, I&#39;ll rework it to be a lot better. Mostly the outside.\r<br />\r<br />FAQ\r<br />\r<br />Does this mod have smithing suplies or a forge inside?\r<br />No, its a basic house. How many of your friends have complex ventilated forges in their basements. (Don&#39;t answer that question)\r<br />\r<br />How about Alchemy?\r<br />No, did you read the first question? Same basic answer.\r<br />\r<br />Ugh, okay, what can I do in there?\r<br />Ah, Now that is the correct question. You can COOK&#33; In a house&#33; I know, keep you socks on, there&#39;s more. You can store junk in it to&#33;Â \r<br />\r<br />Change Log\r<br />0.1 Initial Release\r<br />0.2 Greatly improved exterior, added more detail and storage to the kitchen, and added various wall deco\r<br />0.2 No real progress on the navmesh, but I have tinkered with it. Oh and theres this....\r<br />0.3 I navmeshed both floors of the house (only took me a couple of months)\r<br />   -Also added a workbench and a second bedroom in the basement\r<br />   -the right bedroom is a follower room, the left is a child bedroom,or if you are like me and think kids are gross and sticky, just fill it with cats or something.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view3/2972169/victor-dancing-o.gif[/img]\r<br />[size=5][b]Congrats on one hell of a season guys[/b][/size]",
