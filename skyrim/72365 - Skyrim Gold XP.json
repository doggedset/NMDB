  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6][center][b][u]\r<br />Skyrim Gold XP[/u][/b][/center][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][center][i]First of all, I want to thank lofgren. He wrote and implemented a script for me as a Request over at the Nexus-Forums. [/i][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center]This Mod will take the Vanilla-Experiencesystem away and replace it by one, \r<br />which is based only on Gold, by making use of the Skilltrainers.[/center]\r<br />[center]This Mod aims for creating a Gameplay, where Development of your Character is more connected with the Gameworld, without providing to much Ingame-hastle or the need for a heavily scriptet System, \r<br />which will operate quite isolated from other Gamemechanics. \r<br />\r<br />Quickly you will remember where Trainers stay, you may have to join a Faction to get access. \r<br />Doing Quests will now be way more rewarding, a Feeling which, in my Opinion, Vanilla-Skyrim lacks. Further I ga[size=3]ve Gold a real Ingame-Value by providing a massive Gold-Sink and making it harder to obtain, because in my Playthroughs, Gold becomes meaningless mostly very quickly.[/size] It will make finding Gold a great thing now, for example in a Boss-Chest or similar (but don&#39;t worry, the Game will send you off with some Money to get started). \r<br />By overhauling the Experience-System, there also will be no more Skill-Grinding (I&#39;m looking at you, Enchanting & Smithing&#33;). And as a great Sideeffect, it gives additional meaning to other Mods, \r<br />which open new ways to earn money (see list below) .. \r<br />\r<br />All this is reached by four changes to gameplay: [/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][u]1. You will no longer gain Skill the normal way by using a Skill[/u]\r<br />\r<br />[u]2. All of you sellingprices will be multiplied by zero [/u]\r<br />[size=2]- this means you still can give stuff to vendors, but they won&#39;t give you any money for it\r<br />- buying in any way is not affected by this, still normal Skyrim prices[/size]\r<br />[size=2]- making Money is now a real task and will not just happen[/size]\r<br />[size=2]- can be deactivated very easy (or set to a desired Percentage, read &#34;Balancing & Rebalancing&#34;)\r<br />- see sticky-post in comment section for further thougts why I did this feature[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[u]3. All Normal and Main Quests will give you a Goldamount as reward[/u]\r<br />[size=2]- Reward is configurable[/size]\r<br />[size=2]- Works with Mod-added Quests[/size]\r<br />[size=2]- this does not refer to Misc-Objectives: small Quests, which are listet under Various in your Journal, \r<br />but many of them are already paid, for example Bounty-Quests[/size]\r<br />[u]\r<br />4. All Vanilla-Trainers will train you up to skill 100 as long as you can pay for it[/u]\r<br />[size=2]- There will be no Trainingcap and the price for training has been rebalanced\r<br />- Price can be editet\r<br />- Will work for Mod-added Trainers, if they&#39;re based on Vanilla Trainersystem\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/center][size=2][center][u][b][size=4]Balancing & Rebalancing[/size][/b][/u][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center]Of course there are a lot of different tastes in Balancing and even more Mod-Setups out there, which all influence Balance in a different way. \r<br />The mod is standardly set to 1000g Reward per Quest. Skilltraining is set to 25g per Skillpoint, this amount gets added to price with every new skilllevel. This means raising your Skill from 15 to 16 will cost 375 Gold (15*25g), but raising it from 49 to 50 will cost 1225 Gold. So basicly, doing a Quest will get you 2-3 Skillpoints when you&#39;re at lvl 15, 1 Skillpoint when you&#39;re at Skilllevel 40 and for your 100th Skilllevel you&#39;ll need to do 2-3 Quests and raising a Skill from 15 to 100 will cost you 121125 Gold (...but remember, Questing is not the only way to aquire Gold in Skyrim).\r<br />\r<br />You can change [u]Goldcost per Training[/u] and how your [u]Selling-Prices[/u] are modified by using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859/?]TES5edit[/url], it is very simple and works on an existing save, no need to start a new game. Install the mod and then open TES5edit, it is just one number you have to change. I&#39;ve added two pictures, which explain what to do in TES5edit, don&#39;t worry, it is a very easy and quick edit. It is not possible to change this Values ingame by console command. \r<br />\r<br />The [u]Questreward[/u] can be changed ingame by console command: Type &#34;set ax_GoldperQuest to X&#34; (without &#34; &#34;) where X is your desired amount. \r<br />Also the [u]Vanillaexperiencesystem[/u] can be reactivated by typing &#34;set ax_TrainingOn to 1&#34; (0 instead of 1 would deactivete it).[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][u][b][size=4]Trainers[/size][/b][/u][/center]\r<br />[center]I&#39;ve decided to not add new trainers, since there are already quite many around. Basicly you can learn every Mage-related Skill in College of Winterhold, every Warrior-related Skill by joining Companions in Whiterun, and in Riften you will find a Trainer for every Thief-releated Skill except Speechcraft, which is trained at Bardscollege in Solitude. Also there are a lot of Trainers at Dawnguard-Castle. To get access to most of them, you may have to do a small Introductionquest (which, of course, will give you some Gold to get started ;P).[/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][u][b][size=4]Mods that may go well with this...[/size][/b][/u][/center]\r<br />\r<br />There are many Mods out, which influence Economy or offer new ways to earn gold. Here are some suggestions, which may bait you into a new, different Skyrim Playthrough :D .. though none of these Mods are needed, the System will run well on its own. \r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35305/?]Your Market Stall by wgstein[/url]...open your own Market Stall and may sell some of your found Items\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61028/?]The Drunken Dragon by pufthemajicdragon[/url]...or even open not just a Stall, but a whole shop\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71024/?]My Stores in Skyrim by 95f890be[/url]...put those Housecarls to some good use\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71136/?]Spouse&#39;s Store by 95f890be[/url] ...or let your Spouse have a real store instead of a &#34;store&#34;\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50992/?]Heljarchen Farm by Skvindt[/url]...own a Farm, which lets you earn money and will provide you with food...\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68981/?]The Golden Hen by Jokerine[/url]...and may sell this food in your own restaurant\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37774/?]Real Estate by M3t4lxxx[/url]...why not become a Landlord?\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51633/?]Become Jarl of Ivarstead by Locaster[/url]...or Jarl?\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41087/?]Become High King of Skyrim by aysigago[/url]...or why not even High King?\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34959/?]Syrim Tycoon Reloaded by Joubarbe[/url] ...or get heavy into Big Buisness&#33;\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71425/?]Taxation in Skyrim by 95f890be[/url] ...with all this Buisness and Governmentstuff you may feel the need for Taxes...\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56319/?]Bordeciel Bank Mod by oratchicat[/url]...and a Bank\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56682/?]Ouka&#39;s More NPC Pocket Money by HosokawaTakuya[/url]...NPCs will have more money and may use it to buy from your shops - or for getting robbed :)\r<br />[size=3][size=2][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63874/?]Immersive Speechcraft by SirSalami[/url] ...to make Speechcraft worth investing in it - Interact with NPCs in new ways, many of them gold-related[/size][/size]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60445/?]SkyComplete by kefka95[/url] ...shows you all the Quests, which exists in Skyrim and its DLC and tracks it for you\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70142/?]The Notice Board by mannygt[/url]...of course the famous Notice Board for getting more paid Quests\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24758/?]Increased Bounty and Guild Rewards by svartberg[/url]...may for rebalancing purpose\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16231/?]Reduced Gold Rewards for Quests by mjharber[/url]...more fiddling with Balance to your taste\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15833/?]Expensive Investments by Grieche[/url]...make houses, horses, furniture and followers more expensive\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2762/?]Cutthroat Merchants by Phitt[/url] ...and also everything else you could buy\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49496/?]Scarcity by syclonix[/url]...while you find less loot (also gold)\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/43017/?]All Trainers by bananbro[/url]...adds  a Trainer for every Skill in Whiterun, which can train up to skill 100\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12872/?]Automatic Perks by a.ellis[/url]...get related Perks as soon as you have (bought :P) the skill for it\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3060/?]Septim Retexture by malkav17[/url]...and last, but not least - show the glory of your precious&#33;\r<br />\r<br />And there is more .. :)\r<br />\r<br />[center][u][b][size=4]Installation, Requirements and Uninstallation[/size][/b][/u][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center]&gt; The Base-Version of this Mod only needs latest Version of [url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE[/url], but Trainers in Solstheim (Dragonborn DLC) will not offer training\r<br />&gt; The Legendary Version needs [url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE[/url], all DLC and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71214/?]Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch[/url], all Corrections of USLEEP have been forwarded\r<br />\r<br />&gt; For installation just use NMM, similar or drag and drop the files manually in your Skyrim/data/ folder. \r<br />\r<br />&gt; For Upgrading from Base to Legendary Edition just overwrite or uninstall Base-Version and then install Legendary Edition. Make sure new Legendary Edition has the same Place in your Loadorder as Base-Version had.\r<br />\r<br />&gt; When uninstalling midgame you may want to use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52363/?]Savegame Script Cleaner by Hadoram[/url] to clean your savegame afterwards. [/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][u][b][size=4]Compability[/size][/b][/u][/center]\r<br />[/size][/size]\r<br />[center]&gt; The only Records, this mod changes, are releated to Trainers (not the NPCs itself) and the Dialoge for Training, so mods which edit this, might be incompatible. Mods which just add new Trainers are basicly compatible, but will may not teach up to skill 100. \r<br />\r<br />&gt; The Vanilla Skill-gain is stopped by using SKSE, Mods which change this will have no effect. Elys&#39; Community Uncapper is still compatible. \r<br />\r<br />&gt; Most Skillrelated Overhauls will be compatible, as long as there are still Skilltrainers around and supported.\r<br />\r<br />&gt; All other effects are new Records and won&#39;t be incompatible with other mods.
