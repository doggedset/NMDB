I\\'ll be creating more weapons and armor soon!  This is my first real mod for Skyrim.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS:\r\n\r\nFor those of you who are new to mods, it is a very simple process.  The file included is a .rar file.  Extract this to your Desktop (or anywhere, really).  It will extract a file called \\\"Mod.\\\"  Inside are two folders and a .esp file.  Copy and paste these into the \\\"Data\\\" folder in your Skyrim installation directory.  If it asks you if you\\'d like to merge folders press \\\"Yes to all\\\"\r\n",
