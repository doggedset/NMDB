  "descriptionHtml": "I give you Belle, the Adventurer.  She has always wanted to get out there and explore and now she has a chance to go on grand adventures and quests along side the Dragonborn.   Except this time, she is a werewolf.  There is a back story to that, which is not lore friendly at all.  It all started with The Beast.\r<br />\r<br />The Beast&#39;s real name is Vincent.  He was a noble by birth but was a dishonorable treasure seeker.  There had been rumors of a priceless weapon of immense power hidden within the Glenmoril Coven which was guarded by witches just as fearsome.  The Beast, driven by selfishness and greed, stole the weapon from the Witches and was cursed with gift of Lycanthropy.  Vincent was enraged and sought first to cure it and then abused it, using it not in the spirit of the hunt but in the pursuit of power.  This angered the Daedric Prince Hircine and as punishment for his selfishness and thirst for power and control, Hircine cursed Vincent to live unchanging from his Werewolf state.  \r<br />\r<br />There were whispers that the only way to reverse the curse was through true love.  We all know the next part of the story.  The Beast hides away in his castle, a merchant lost in the woods finds his way to it and takes refuge, Beast takes merchant prisoner... blah blah blah.... enter Belle.  Belle has some Elvish heritage that has been forgotten over the generations but she is a Nord at heart, always looking for glory and adventure and like all Nords, she believes wholeheartedly that Sovngard is where her spirit will go.   \r<br />\r<br />Belle fell in love with the Beast in spite of his unchanging state and for a while they were happy.  But then The Beast accidentally got dental with Belle at an inopportune moment thus infecting Belle with Lycanthropy.  Knowing there was no cure and knowing that she has been forever barred from Sovngard, Belle flew into a rage and ran away.  Belle has a kind heart but the beast within her is addicted to rage and power and all strong emotions, it began to take over.  Unable to control the beast within, she finds refuge within the halls of Jarvaskr.  Being around other wolves who share her passion for glory and adventure help calm her beast and help her find new meaning to her life.  *Please note that she is not actually a werewolf.  The only NPC you see turn into a wolf is Farkus and Aiela even though they are all wolves.  I know it is possible to make her transform into an actual wolf but I don&#39;t know how to do that without the aid of one of the follower overhaul mods you will find links to at the bottom. \r<br />\r<br />[center]Belle\r<br />Location: Jarvaskr, in the back training area\r<br />Race: Nord\r<br />Body: CBBE, UUNP, HDT\r<br />Armor: Saber Dress\r<br />Weapons: Glass \r<br />Class: Combat Barbarian\r<br />Combat Style: Human Melee\r<br />\r<br />She does not know any spells but she has all the useful stats from Archery, 1H, 2H weapons, Block, Heavy Armor and Light Armor so she can fight however you need/Want her to.  Armor is of Leather Quality so it is easily changed.\r<br />All used skills start off at level 50 but she will level with you.\r<br />Starting Health/ Magicka / Stamina is 300\r<br />\r<br />Though it is not lore friendly to my version of Belle (Because she is pissed but still in love with Beast) she is Marriageable.\r<br />\r<br />Quick Note.  If you use any Whiterun Overhauls or mods that completely change the appearance of Whiterun, she may not spawn.  Don&#39;t know why but I think because the cell she spawns in is altered it overwrites her spawning.  If that is the case, this is not a bug.  Try moving her esp to the bottom of the load order or use console command to spawn her. `help &#34;Belle&#34; then player.placeatme (npc code it listed) without the (). \r<br />\r<br />The Enchanted Rose - [spoiler]As it says in my permissions, you are free to do with this what you will.  It is not &#34;bugged&#34; per say because it will not damage your system or anything.  But I cannot get it to work.  It is supposed to be a staff that absorbs health.  I built it from the Sangries Rose and then from the Staff of Magnus.  Still can&#39;t get it to actually do anything and it has delayed this follower for quite some time.  Between life and motherhood, I don&#39;t have time to tinker with it any more.  So if you can fix it, awesome.  If not, sell it.  It is worth 5000 gold.  \r<br />Depending on which version you download, she may or may not have it in her inventory.  If she does not, just open the console commands ` and type help &#34;Enchanted Rose&#34; then type player.additem (code it gives you) without () 1 to add 1, ect. [/spoiler]\r<br /> Absorbs 100 points of Health per second.  Why so powerful?  First and foremost, it is a weapon of immense power and unlike every other &#34;weapon of immense power&#34; in the game, this one is actually a weapon of immense power.  With my version of the Beast and all that, why in the world would he face Hag Ravens, Curses and Death for a lousy weapon that restores 25 points of health at level 60 and the Dragonborn is running around with up to 700 health not including any armor bonuses?  Lame... So 100 points of health seems like something truly worth risking so much for and lives up to the title &#34;weapon of immense power&#34;.  \r<br />Secondly,  The lore on the Rose is open for interpretation, as is the story.  The Red Rose is the symbol of many things.  It represents Life, Love and Beauty but also Blood and Death.  So the Enchanted Rose will restore the bearers life force with blood of the bearers foes.  aka, absorb health. \r<br />Bell will hold it but her skills and combat style don&#39;t allow her to use it.  You can take it from her.  If you don&#39;t like overpowered stuff then you can sell it for gold equal to its worth.
