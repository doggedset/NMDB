This little haven is inspired by the tiny houses [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/7913946?tab=user+files]lolikyonyu[/url] made for Classic. I really wanted something small with no load screens and this is the result! There's a bed, cook pot, alchemy and enchanting stations, and a lot of storage! \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8][size=3]Recommended[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[size=2][*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18162]Enhanced Landscapes[/url] Specifically the Dead Marsh optional file.

She's awesome. Go check out her stuff!\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#9fc5e8]Notes for Survival Users:\n<br />[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />I tried, but I couldn't seem to get the bed past drained. I'm still looking into this and there will be an update if I can figure it out. For now, the fire does give off heat so the house is warm.\n<br />\n<br />[b]There will be no Classic version of this mod. Please do not ask for one.[/b]",
