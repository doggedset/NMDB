  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b]NOTICE:\r\n Please use the \\\"[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10521]ACE - Crafting[/url]\\\" mod instead of this mod!\r\n * http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10521 *\r\nThis mod will not receive regular updates. [/b][/center]\r\n\r\n This is one part of the \\\"Balanced Crafting Project - Enchanting Smithing\\\" mod.\r\n This part only balances the fortify potions and enchants for crafting.\r\n The full mod also balances the smithing and enchanting skill trees and perks.\r\n This part is here in case there are conflicts with the full mod but you still want to use some of the features.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS MODIFIED:\r\n\r\nAt max alchemy and all perks:\r\n- fortify restoration potions: +8%\r\n- fortify enchanting potions: +8%\r\n- fortify smithing potions: +8%\r\nAt max enchanting and all perks:\r\n- fortify alchemy enchantment: +5%\r\n- fortify smithing enchantment: +5%\r\n\r\nYou can still find items and potions with slightly better smithing/alchemy though, so pay attention to your loot!\r\n\r\nWith the 3 mods installed here are the total smithing bonuses compared to vanilla Skyrim.\r\nRemember this is added to the smithing skill, so it\\'s not actually 1/4 the total armor.\r\nBalanced Mods:\r\n 30% from smithing perks\r\n 5% x4 from smithing enchants on armor\r\n 8% from smithing potion\r\n = 58% increase total (only a few armors hit armor-cap)\r\n\r\nVanilla Skyrim\r\n 100% from smithing perks\r\n 25% x4 from smithing enchants on armor\r\n 25% from smithing potion\r\n = 225% increase total (basically hit armor-cap with almost anything)\r\n\r\nAnd vanilla is easy to exploit too, but I wont get into that, suffice it to say mine is not.\r\nPlaying with this mod means you can max out the skill tree and still play a balanced game!\r\nNote; Item drops and loot can still drop good enchantments, it makes looting worthwhile again!\r\n\r\nComments and suggestions are welcome, I\\'m open to making different versions.\r\n\r\nCHANGE LOG\r\nV2 - modified %\\'s to make only the best light armors hit armor-cap\r\nV1 - the original file\r\n\r\nNOTE: To people adding this mod mid-game. Everything will transfer over smoothly. \r\nYour old potions and gear will still have their vanilla-level enchants on them though.\r\nNOTE2: I strongly recommend making a new set of armor after installing this!",
