  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a set of armor, which is based off of the armor the Dragonborn wears in the Skyrim trailer, to the game. What it does is, when a piece is equipped, grants 20% less Shout recharge time. When all pieces (Cuirass, boots, gloves, helmet, and amulet) are worn, you have absolutely no recharge time, effectively allowing you to fight only with the Voice.\r<br />Keep in mind, since the pieces of armor recreate (mostly) the armor set from the trailer and promotions, it is both heavy and light armor. Half heavy, half light. I will upload versions that are ONLY light armor and ONLY heavy armor in the future&#33; For now, though, it&#39;s half of each.\r<br />This armor set was made to look less like a warrior&#39;s armor, covered in heavy plate metal, but still retaining a few elements of heavier armor and keeping the iconic Iron helm.\r<br />It&#39;s located in Delphine&#39;s secret room. If you don&#39;t know where that is, I&#39;d recommend playing through the main quest.",
