  "summary": "Instantly add quantities of the most used potions in Skyrim!",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u][color=#00ff00][size=4]Description / Instructions[/size][/color][/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Fed up of running around in Skyrim trying to find all the potion ingredients or potions you need, or cheating the hard way looking for console codes and adding them one by one. It takes forever!\n<br />[size=4][color=#a4c2f4]Now you can cheat the easy way just by typing one console command[/color] [/size]- great for when you've played Skyrim several times and you just want an easy life! Or if you set up multiple profiles with mod organizer and want to progress quickly. As an added bonus if you find you have too many potions you can sell them to merchants, make loads of money and buy Skyrim!\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#00ff00][size=3]Installation[/size][/color][/u]\n<br />Simply copy the file into your [u]Skyrim[/u] directory (where you installed Steam - not the data directory as you would with normal mod files). Then open the console by pressing the tilde key (`) and type in the command bat AddPotions\n<br />[i][color=#cc4125][size=3]Now you have most of the potions you will need to get you through[/size].[/color] It takes a minute or so to add all of the items to your inventory. [/i]If you need to add more, just type the command again. If you don't like the quantities added by this mod, just edit the text file and include however many you need of each item, or add new items - using a semicolon before a command will remove the item (it will just be treated as a comment instead of a command).\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][color=#00ff00]FILES INCLUDED IN ZIP FILE[/color]\n<br />[/u][/b]\n<br />[size=3][i]AddPotions      - adds potions in the following quantities...[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#ffff00]Quantities Added[/color][/u]\n<br />2 Blacksmith's Elixir\n<br />2 Enchanter's Draught\n<br />2 Enchanter's Elixir\n<br />2 Enchanter's Philter\n<br />2 Enchanter's Potion\n<br />1 Falmer Blood Elixir\n<br />2 Philter Of True Shot\n<br />1 Philter Of The Phantom\n<br />5 Potion Of Prolonged Invisibility\n<br />2 Potion Of Alteration\n<br />10 Potion of Cure Disease\n<br />2 Potion Of Cure Poison\n<br />10 Potion Of Ultimate Healing\n<br />10 Potion Of Ultimate Magicka\n<br />10 Potion Of Ultimate Stamina\n<br />[/size][u][size=4]\n<br />[color=#ffff00]Using mod managers[/color][/size][/u]\n<br />If you use profiles with Mod Organizer, don't put the file in the profile folder, just the main Skyrim folder. I don't think any mod manager will install this for you - you have to do it manually! If someone knows how to get a mod manager to do this please feel free to edit at will...\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#ffff00]Compatibility[/color][/u]\n<br />Shouldn't clash with anything as far as I know - these files don't use any resources or scripts and aren't installed like normal mods in the data folder so they shouldn't cause any problems. It should also count as an extra mod you can have without adding to the limit that mod organizer can handle!\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#ffff00]Incompatibility[/color][/u]\n<br />Nothing as far as I know - please let me know if this mod crashes your game, causes glitches in the matrix or steals your girlfriend. \n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Please let me know if there are any items you feel I've missed.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#ffff00]Uninstallation[/color][/u]\n<br />Simply delete the files and refrain from using the bat command anymore. Alternatively, delete the files, use the bat command and ponder why it's not working.\n<br />\n<br />Feel free to copy, hack, exploit, edit, reverse engineer, infringe copyright (there are none) upload to other sites, or do whatever else you want with the files, with the exception of charging for them or uploading them to a site that will charge for them. These files are free to anyone and everyone who wants them!\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#b6d7a8]CREDITS[/color][/u]\n<br />Bethesda, Steam, Nexus - you rock!\n<br />Me!!!\n<br />My family for putting up with my computer and gaming addictions! (The wife said why haven't I fetched her chocolate instead of doing this?) pfffft!\n<br />:D\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cc4125][size=4]Please see my other mods...[/size][/color]\n<br />[color=#6d9eeb]Instant Smithing... http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67304/?\n<br />Instant Perks... http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67269/?\n<br />Instant Shouts... http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67318/?\n<br />Instant Skyrim spells... http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67322/?\n<br />[color=#6d9eeb]Super Powerful Weapons and Armor... http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68236/?[/color][/color]\n<br />\n<br />This is my third mod so please be patient, support isn't going to be that great.
