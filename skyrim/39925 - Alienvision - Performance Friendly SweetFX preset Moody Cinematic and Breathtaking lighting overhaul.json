  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=4][b][color=#00cc00]\r\nThis is not an ENB, and does not use any part of an ENB! It is pure SweetFX, and should have almost no performance hit or compatibility issues!\r\n\r\nThis mod is part of More Alien Skyrim, and is basically a standalone upgrade to the SweetFX preset included with my other mod [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32972/]More Alien Skyrim Sky and Light[/url] - In fact, I suggest using that mod with this one, just install that one first, and then overwrite the SweetFX files with this one\r\n\r\nThis mod is designed to be very dramatic, moody, and breathtaking, without having any major hit on FPS. It is an attempt at getting ENB level lighting enhancement without the use of an ENB. Things are indeed colorful, but not grossly over saturated. Nights are very dark, but this is a personal preference of mine, if it is requested I may make a less dark nights version.\r\n\r\nDo you think the shadows are too dark, and don\\'t want to wait for a new version?\r\nOpen the SweetFX_Settings.ini and go to the Lift Gamma Gain settings. \r\nMake sure to keep all three in a group the same number!\r\n\r\nSome of the other mods used in the screenshot are;\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32972/]More Alien Skyrim Sky and Light[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17802/]Climates of Tamriel[/url]\r\n\r\nI did not create, or help create SweetFX itself, I am using these files with indirect permission from the author via the permissions of the mod uploaded by them.
