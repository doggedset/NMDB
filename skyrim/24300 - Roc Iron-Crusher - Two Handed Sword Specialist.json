  "descriptionHtml": "Roc Iron-Crusher is a new follower located in the living quarters of Jorrvaskr. He\\'s joined the companions recently, and he\\'s been a natural fit due to his size and abilities with two-handed swords. He should be compatible with all follower mods. I use UFO and My Home is Your Home and he works with both just fine. I created him mainly to use with things like UFO so that I could add to my horde of followers so hopefully he\\'ll be a welcome addition to join your army!\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Note:[/color] Smaller file size is uploaded.\r\n\r\n[color=Yellow]Installation:[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=Yellow]Immersive Armors already installed:[/color] Install Roc and when prompted, say No when asked to overwrite files.\r\n\r\n[color=Yellow]Immersive Armors not installed:[/color] Install Roc like any other mod.\r\n\r\nMods used to create Roc:\r\n\r\nEinherjar Armor by Omesean\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12693\r\n\r\nWarchief Armor by Hothtrooper44\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13366\r\n\r\nFrankDema Travel BackPack by FrankDema\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23913\r\n\r\nAll mods used with permission.
