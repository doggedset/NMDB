  "descriptionHtml": "Hello fellow modders! I present a brand new armor set for the Stormcloak rebels! \r\n\r\nI started working on this project because well, I never liked the Stormcoak armor. It looked less like an alternate army and more like a bunch of guards banding together against the imperial legion. So, I sought to counter that with a recolor of my favorite armor in traditional blue and black. \r\n\r\nNow this mod is still in testing and I would love some feedback, currently the only problem I've had is a mild gleam on the armor which could very well be my own laptop having trouble with the lighting. So! If anyone would like to edit or tweak this product, or managed to improve it, by all means fix it. I ask that you ask me or let me know in the comments first so that I can download it if improvements are made, and feel free to upload as many screenshots as you like if you enjoy this in your games. \r\n\r\nCredits: \r\nSkyrim team. \r\nCreation Kit. \r\nNifskope. \r\nAnnnd of course: IsharaMeradin for helping me through the learning process <3 ",
