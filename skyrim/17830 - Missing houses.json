the same spot as mine [If they\\'re in the same city but in different spots then it IS compatible].\r\n[*]Mods that alter/rebuild cities in which the player houses are located in [They would still work but could be misplaced]\r\n[*]Mods that edit the House Purchase script and favor scripts.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nIf you have any other compatibility problem and you\\'re sure it\\'s because of my mod, please leave a comment, thanks!\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Installation[/b][/size]\r\n1. Extract the file(s) from the .zip you just downloaded;\r\n2. Move the Missing Houses.esp and Missing Houses.bsa files inside skyrim\\'s data folder;\r\n3. Activate Missing_houses.esp;\r\n4. Play and see if everything works correctly.\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Uninstallation[/b][/size]\r\n1. Get off the house(s) all the stuff you stored (if any);\r\n2.

Some stewards such as Malur Seloth stay outside often, so you\\'ll have to wait them to go back inside Jarl\\'s longhouse to purchase any decoration or upgrade.\r\n\r\n[*]The steward is inside Jarl\\'s longhouse but I can\\'t buy the house or any decoration/upgrade anyway!\r\nSome people have reported this problem, sometimes just with a particular character, other times it won\\'t work with any character, I\\'m still trying to figure out and solve this problem.\r\n\r\n[*]What\\'s the difference between decoration and upgrade?\r\nDecorations add new items to a previous empty area (and often clean that area from cobwebs and dirt in the process) while upgrades add new whole areas by expanding the house outside and of course inside which will unlock new decorations (Some are pre-decorated though), while all houses can be decored not all houses can be upgraded.\r\n\r\n[*]Are items stored in the house safe?\r\nYes, they are.\r\nYou\\'ll have to purchase the house from the city\\'s steward to get your home in player\\'s faction though.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Known bugs[/b][/size]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Trinsmardia\\'s door to balcony graphical error (but it works)\r\n[*]Houses can be purchased even if you\\'re not thane\r\n[*]Quests don\\'t complete after you visit your new home\r\n[*]Trinsmardia Graphical bug on main entrance\r\n[/list]\r\nIf you find any other bug please tell me with a comment, thanks!\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Special thanks[/b][/size]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]waxman08 - For taking the time to test my mod and tell me all the bugs, thanks!\r\n[*]Ghaunadaur - For taking the time to test my mod, tell me all the bugs and give me various suggestions, thanks!\r\n[*]German translation by Ghaunadaur.\r\n[*]Paintings and Frames mod by Artisanix.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
