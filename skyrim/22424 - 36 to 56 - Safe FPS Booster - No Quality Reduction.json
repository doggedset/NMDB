  "descriptionHtml": "NOTE: I\\'m very sorry for that \\\"love letter\\\" thing you had downloaded before. It was my cousin\\'s joke. Hope he won\\'t do that again. New version should work like a charm.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n36 to 56 - Safe FPS Booster\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nClever and safe .ini file that stabilises your game\\'s performance adding up to 20 FPS plus without losing anything at graphics. Just put into your Skyrim direction folder. Made by me and my cousin who used to work in Novalogic as a Lead Programmer for the game called Delta Force: Xtreme.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nI. INSTALLATION\r\nJust put the SkyrimFPS.ini file into your game\\'s direction folder (where the SkyrimLauncher file is).\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nII. COMPATIBILITY\r\n36 to 56 - Safe FPS Booster is possibly (not tested enough to prove it 100%) compatible and safe to run with every modification and other performance boosters for Skyrim. It\\'s just a seperate file that doesn\\'t invole in anything besides game\\'s performance system.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIII. BUGS\r\nTested on mine\\'s Windows 7 computer and on cousin\\'s Windows XP laptop. After one day of playing we didn\\'t record any bugs at all. But if you notice any during your gameplay - write in comments or PM me.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIV. CREDITS\r\nBuntownik11cm and NovaLizard81 (but he did most of the job so he deserves more credit than me)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAnd remember - if you\\'ll encounter any problems during your play with this modification - WRITE ME. We want this booster to be the best as it can get so any help from you is another step to perfection.",
