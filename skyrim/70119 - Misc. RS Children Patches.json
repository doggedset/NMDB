  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#e69138][size=5]Misc. RS Children Patches[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />[size=3]Now that I have your attention...\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=3]These are some random patches that I&#39;ve either been asked to share or to create. \r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#e69138][size=4]What mods do these patches, uh, patch?[/size][/color][/center][/size]\r<br />[size=3]The list of patches as of right now:\r<br />[/size][list]\r<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54670/?]Golden Crossroads[/url][/size]\r<br />[*][size=3][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35841/?]Helgen Reborn[/url][/size]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[size=3]Not a huge list, sure. But there might be more to come. If you, dear reader, create a RS Children patch and want to have it on this page (for some reason), then secure the correct permissions and throw it my way.\r<br />\r<br />Credit, as always, will be given. \r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=4][center][color=#e69138]Installation[/color][/center][/size]\r<br />[center][/center][size=3]You, of course, have several options for installation.\r<br />\r<br />Manual, where you just put the files in the data folder.\r<br />\r<br />Through NMM, which should work. Not a huge fan to be honest.\r<br />\r<br />Through MO, which is a gamble on your part because I don&#39;t and probably won&#39;t ever use it. So I don&#39;t know what will happen.\r<br />\r<br />Through another mod manager, available somewhere out on the Internets. Probably on some crazy Japanese site. Or Russian.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][color=#e69138][size=4][center]Permissions[/center][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]If you want to put/host any of these patches on another site or something, you will need to obtain permission from the original mod author.\r<br />Also, a passing mention of credit would be nice.\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#e69138][size=4]Credits[/size][/color][/center][/size]\r<br />[size=3]Ranaline, for making RS Children, which in turn makes kids not look like crazy hobo aliens.\r<br />\r<br />Jokerine, for making The Golden Crossroads, which I hear involves that most despicable of crimes: Capitalism. Like Recettear&#33; But with less haggling.\r<br />\r<br />Mike Hancho, for Helgen Reborn. I&#39;m told it turns Helgen into a decent town instead of an orgy of Bandits. (I&#39;m using that correctly, go look it up and get your mind off the Internet.)\r<br />\r<br />expired6978[color=#ffffff], for Race Menu, that made these patches possible. Also, really vain Dovahkiins.\r<br />\r<br />And Bethesda Game Studios, I think they had a small part in making Skyrim. Possibly.[/color][/size]",
