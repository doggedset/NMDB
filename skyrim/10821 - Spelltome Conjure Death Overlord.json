  "descriptionHtml": "After many hours on the CK, I finally figured how to add a new character to the spelltome so I can conjure him. The possibilities are great. Now I am able to make mods that the player can conjure, say a giant mud crab, the giant himself, werewolfs, saber cat, a character you made and wish him or her conjurable. \r\nThis mod, I made the death overlord as a trying element, I made him much taller and now he retains duration time of 60 seconds as per usual. I hope you guys like this spell. \r\n\r\nWhere to get it\r\nGo to Riverwood Traders, it\\'s in one of the chest on the second level. (sorry I forgot to include this text)",
