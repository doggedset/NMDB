Later a powerful mage entered his temple, and bound him and his followers to never leave, this caused their souls to never leave, and allowing them, although being dead, to roam the halls, forever.[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=4]Reward[/size]\r\n[size=2]The reward for defeating the Unbound King are; a new player home, a new spell, and two new weapons.[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=4]Known Issues And How To Surpass Them[/size]\r\n[size=2]If one has already completed the quest Horn of Jorgan Windcaller, before downloading the mod, they may not be able to enter the Dungeon.\r\nTo fix this, simply either type, \\'help Staadnau\\', into the console and type \\'player.additem ########\\' (the id to the Staadnau Key not the master key), or you could simply carry on the main quest, to the point where you see Alduin resurrecting the named dragon Sahloknir, there will be a burnt corpse with the key on their burnt corpse.[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=3]I have also added a new lore book that you can buy from Urag at the College of Winterhold, or from any tavern in the Whiterun hold or even at any pawnbroker in th Whiterun hold.[/size]\r\n\r\n[size=4]Credits[/size]\r\n[size=2]Enoomnai for making the mod\r\nAlduinV3 for supporting me\r\nUsnex for teaching me how to use the Creation Kit and the Mod Editor\r\nBethesda for making the amazing games known as The Elder Scrolls\r\nTodd Howard for being Todd Howard[/size]",
