  "summary": "All the enchants in the world are being rebalanced for a greater Skyrim experience. Main changes include making artifacts worth wearing even if you already have a l33t enchanted item on your character. This will make the long quest of fetching the artifact worth while. It also re-balances enchantments to their real rarity or value /effectiveness. A",
  "descriptionHtml": "Welcome, this is a patch that was required even in late 2012. It\\'s only for vanilla it doesn\\'t touch Dawnguard artifacts. I made this patch because I was in need for it.\r\n\r\nPatch notes:\r\n    -It re-balances all of the artifacts(none omitted), making them worth the quest line and their cool look. This balancing is only required because you could already have items of such magnitude from enchanting and so forth making you refuse wearing the new cool-looking hard-earned item.\r\n    -It re-balances schools of magic enchantments such as Destruction spells cost less, making it almost impossible to gain 100%. It brings them down to their essential effectiveness.",
