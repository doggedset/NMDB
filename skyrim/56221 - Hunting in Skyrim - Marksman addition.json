  "summary": "tweaks a few perks to make the bow a viable main weapon, while using the archery perk tree of Hunting in Skyrim",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Description:[/b]\r<br />My favorite weapon is the bow, but in Skyrim it feels too weak, especially of you keep in mind that even a medieval longbow was capable of penetrating and killing a full armored knight. A bow, made of wood. Take that into Skyrim with materials much, much stronger than wood. And still you have to put multiple arrows in your enemies, even unarmored bandits. \r<br />There are a few mods here on the nexus, aiming at the same goal. But I like the mod [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18866/?]Hunting in Skyrim[/url], including the perks it comes along with (perk version, of course). So this mod aims for Hunting in Skyrim users, feeling the same way about bows like I do. \r<br />\r<br />[b]In detail:[/b]\r<br />- Overdraw rank 4 and 5 give 25% armor penetration each -&gt; 50% overall\r<br />- Quickdraw got a 2nd rank, increasing draw speed by a additional 20% \r<br />- Bullseye redesigned to &#34;Dragon Hunter&#34;. Gives a 20% chance to do 2 times/ 5 times more damage to dragons \r<br />\r<br />Some may ask: Why redesign Bullseye and not make a new perk? Mainly because the paralyse effect hits the moment the shot arrow [i]would[/i] hit it&#39;s target, resulting in the target stiffening up and falling out of the shot. Bullseye is a end perk and should feel awesome. Instead you get angry if it proccs and something like that happens. Besides I noticed: You are the Dragonborn. Killing dragons is what you do. And still, you don&#39;t have anything to fight against dragons in particular.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Requirements:[/b]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18866/?]Hunting in Skyrim[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Install:[/b]\r<br />Put the .esp in your data folder. \r<br />\r<br />[b]Uninstall:[/b]\r<br />Remove the .esp from your data folder.\r<br />\r<br />Disclaimer:\r<br />If anyone wants to mod my mod of a mod, feel free to message me.
