  "descriptionHtml": "Description \r\n=========== \r\n\r\nRiften Bivouac is a small camp just a stones throw outside the Riften North Gate and Riften Stables. It is intended as a temporary site for a character starting out in Skyrim. If you are looking for a fully equipped mansion this is not it. It is purposefully minimalistic and may serve as a permanent or semi-permanent residence for those roleplaying a hunter/alchemist or even a thieves guild character.\r\nIt is located at the intersection of 4 cells in the game and those slightly modified include 3 :\r\n\r\nRiftenCityNorthGateExterior\r\n43,-22\r\n43,-23 \r\n\r\nSpecial Features\r\n================\r\n\r\nThere is a tent, bedroll, non-respawning barrels, sacks and two strongboxes and a chest. All containers are non-respawning even though there may be some loot in some of them initially. There is a tanning rack, a small cooking spit, and an alchemy lab on top of a barrel in a hollowed out tree trunk.\r\nThere is no quest or any apparent reason for it being there and seems to have been simply abandoned. It\\'s yours to use...or not.\r\n \r\n \r\nInstall \r\n======= \r\n\r\nJust drop in your Steam->SteamApps->common->Skyrim->Data folder and make sure it is checked in Data Files in the launcher.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nUsage \r\n======\r\n\r\nYou can do whatever you want with it.\r\n\r\n- Aquan\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n",
