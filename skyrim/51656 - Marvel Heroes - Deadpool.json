  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i738.photobucket.com/albums/xx26/Ain0nline/Logo01_zpse11b60f5.png[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a unique set of armour to Skyrim, based on the Marvel character, Wade Wilson, Deadpool, the Merc with a Mouth&#33;\r<br />Furthermore, it adds an (optional) new race, &#34;Mutant&#34;, allowing you to create your character with Wade&#39;s famous &#34;good looks&#34;, and also comes with some Deadpool based racial bonuses and abilities.\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]of51UOV0q6Y[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i738.photobucket.com/albums/xx26/Ain0nline/logo03_zpse307379d.png[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]7qLo9iPxTqA[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i738.photobucket.com/albums/xx26/Ain0nline/logo04_zpsedc50510.png[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][size=3]The Armour:[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />Based around the Shrouded Armour plus Nightingale boots, retextured with the red and black scheme of Deadpool. It&#39;s unenchanted, and can be crafted under the leather section of the forge, and tempered as usual at the workbench. Stat-wise it&#39;s a little stronger than Shrouded armour. Note the set is standalone, and not a replacer of the shrouded armour. Although it&#39;s based on the notrious latex-bodysuit styles of Marvel, i&#39;ve attempted to make it look more leather based, more in keeping with Skyrim. It&#39;s about as lore-friendly as you can get whilst having a Deadpool logo on your belt&#33;\r<br />Also included in version 2 is an X-Force variant grey retexture.\r<br />Female versions, and all races compatible&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i738.photobucket.com/albums/xx26/Ain0nline/4Armours_zps3f92b7d7.png[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][size=3]The Race:[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />&#34;Mutant&#34; race includes a new skin texture with Wade&#39;s cancerous good looks, as well as 2 racial abilities. Healing Factor makes you immune to disease and grants a much higher health regeneration rate, however Cellular Instability means you&#39;re more prone to magic based attacks and less resistant to poison. It&#39;s not that balanced but then again it&#39;s a Marvel character, not some milk-drinking Nord&#33; Male and female compatible. \r<br />N.B - the female version does not have custom textures for the body, this ensures compatibility with popular female texture mods for altered body meshes, also I want to improve the skin textures more before building them for the female version + body mod compatible versions.\r<br />\r<br />The main file contains everything you need to play as the new Deadpool based race, and get the armour at the forge. An alternative file in the optional section will include just the armour for those who don&#39;t want the additional race.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][size=3]Compatibility & Troubleshooting[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />The armour should not conflict with anything else. It should also be compatible with SkyRe&#39;s Reproccer.\r<br />If you are using other mods that add new races there may be issues I haven&#39;t accounted for, please let me know&#33; There is a version which includes only the armour if required.\r<br />*N.B* Changing the complexion in the race menu will loose the skin on the head. If you want a different complexion, [b]choose this first[/b], then change to another race, then back to the Mutant race. This will allow the mutant skin with the desired complexion, then you can edit as normal.\r<br />French translation available: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52734/?\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][size=3]Installation[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />Recommend NMM.\r<br />Manually, extract into your Skyrim folder. To remove, delete the esp (either AINDeadpool or AINDeadpool - Armour depending on which version you chose, delete the Deadpool folder from both data/meshes and data/textures folder.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][size=3]Future Versions:[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />Further improvements as I learn more, especially normal maps and the skin textures. Might add custom followers at some stage, might have a go at dogpool / headpool&#33;\r<br />Also working on some other Marvel characters&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][size=3]Recommendations:[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />Dual Sheath Redux - to get the swords sheathed on the back like in the screenshots.\r<br />Bandolier Bags + Pouches - for that fully equipped look&#33;\r<br />Immersive Weapons - lots of katanas and blades perfect for Deadpool.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b][size=3]Permissions:[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />Please DO NOT re-upload, mirror, change, modify, or use parts of this mod without my consent. At the moment this is a Nexus exclusive.",
