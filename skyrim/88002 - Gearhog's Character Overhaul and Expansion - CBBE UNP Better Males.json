It would not be where it is without the love and respect all my lovely supporters have given me][/i][/size][/color][/center]\n<br />[center][b][size=5]Merry Christmas![/size][/b][/center]\n<br />[size=3]I'm releasing this now, in an incomplete state, as a Christmas present for all the lovelies on the Nexus! It'll be completed soon, with the exception of the NPC overhaul, which will take quite some time to complete.\n<br />Currently, [b]it replaces[/b] [b]every texture related to the [human/elven] characters, both male and female[/b]. But I'm working on a massive expansion which will include over 200 racemenu overlays, and a ton of complexions, eyes, eyebrows, makeup, warpaints, etc etc etc. For now, there is a smaller (but still rather large, considering) expansion included. But that's just the tip of the iceburge! So track this file to get notifications whenever there's a new update.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />I was going to update RWoS with these changes, but since so many people like that version, and I've now got the male version completed, I figured I'd make a new page with all the new changes and extra features, leaving RWoS as a simple female skin. You can still use RWoS, just download this mod first and let the RWoS textures overwrite.\n<br />\n<br />All the extra features such as eyes, moles, teeth, complexions, etc can now be found on this page.\n<br />[color=#ffff00][size=3][b]The rough complexion has been replaced with something extremely similar to the look you get with RWoS, so be sure to check it out if you're a fan of RWoS!!![/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />I am also working on an NPC overhaul with these extra additions distributed throughout Skyrim, making the population much more diverse and appealing to the eye. Options will be added to the fomod installers, such as choice of wrinkles, roughness, etc. \n<br />Track this page to stay informed. \n<br />[color=#00ff00]If you'd like to help in creating unique NPCs, check out [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88002/?tab=5&amp;&amp;navtag=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fcomments%2F%3Fmod_id%3D88002%26page%3D1%26sort%3DDESC%26pid%3D0%26thread_id%3D6185703&amp;pUp=1]this page[/url], and leave a comment.[/color]\n<br />[size=1][color=#00ffff]I need to edit 100+ female NPCs alone, and that's not including the males. They all need to be unique, and include features inspired by Vanilla! Although, there will be some exceptions... since some vanilla NPCs are seriously terrifying all around.[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />New eyes are also on this page, which have been hand painted. The major difference with these in comparison to the ones from RWoS is that the dark ring has been removed. To me it was a bit too dark for my liking. It was made for personal use however I liked them so much that I've decided to switch them out. I've included the original eyes as a miscellaneous download.\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#00ffff][size=3][b]Check out this awkward tutorial I made on sculpting faces in racemenu:[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[youtube]HdPQiOiWfSA[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />Way less intimidating than you thought, amirite?\n<br />(apologies for the quality and... other issues. first video I've ever made)\n<br />[size=1]\n<br />[/size][color=#ead1dc][size=1]Yeah... I'm female. Not that it matters, but being called a dude is weird.[/size][/color][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00][size=2]I was just diagnosed with a life threatening &amp; chronic condition that may prevent or slow down future updates (possibly stop depending how advanced it is, and how treatment goes). I apologize in advance. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to direct message me.\n<br />For now, I am going to try my best to do as much as I can... And hopefully finish... But please be patient and gentle with me in my fragile state.\n<br />\n<br />I will try and keep everyone updated as time goes on.\n<br />[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][color=#ff7700][size=2]What makes these textures different from RWoS?[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[/list]They look less crack whorey. After MxR said this, I decided to stop being nervous about another release and just get on with it. These are much more refined, yet more detailed in the places they needed to be. I removed the veins on the temples, softened the normal maps, and lightened around the eyes. Basically, they have been completely redone (with the exception of some smaller details). And best of all, THEY'RE NOW AVAILABLE IN UNCOMPRESSED 4K! \n<br />You're welcome.\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*][b][color=#ff7700][size=2]Why aren't the men in 4k?[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[/list]Honestly?

If you prefer something smoother, you can download whatever normal maps you want, or you can just download the head normal map and use TexBlend [url=https://rd.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/5737]CBBE[/url] or [url=https://rd.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30759]UNP[/url] to make it fit! with my body I've had many supporters use this method and it works really well]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][color=#ff7700][size=2]...Why not?[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[/list]Because the whole point of this is to make more natural people.
