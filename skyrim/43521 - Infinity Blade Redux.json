  "descriptionHtml": "This is the Infinity Blade weapon from the popular iOS series Infinity Blade. This is a One-Handed version. This is simply a re-textured version of the original one-handed version from siberok92 to closer match the actual blade in the iOS games. However in Infinity Blade 3 they gave the blade a new look. Will have to remake the blade from scratch eventually :p\r\nI followed the instructions to make it compatible with dual-sheath redux, so it should work with it but oddly it wont show it for me. If anybody has success with it let me know :)\r\n\r\nOther than that nothing is different from siberok92 version.\r\nIt is craftable under the daedric category. Same materials and is still enchantable.\r\n\r\nYou can find the original version of the blade by visiting the following link.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17255/\r\n\r\nCredits ofc mostly belong to siberok92\r\n",
