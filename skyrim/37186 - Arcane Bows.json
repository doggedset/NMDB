  "descriptionHtml": "This is the first mod I&#39;ve made that seemed good enough to release, so any constructive feedback would be greatly appreciated.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Requirements[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Dragonborn is required because the meshes and textures are based off of the Nordic Bow and therefore some of the necessary files are contained in it.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Description[/b]\r<br />\r<br />I had been wanting a bow that had a more &#34;magical&#34; look to it, but I never found anything I really liked. So I dicided to make my own. I&#39;m not the best modeler(and I&#39;m even worse at textuing) so I just modified the Nordic Bow to suit my own tastes. I&#39;m also pretty new to using nifscope so if anyone finds anything I screwed up in there, or knows somthing I did wrong, any instruction you could give would help.\r<br />\r<br />There are two versions of the Bow right now, grey with a blue glow and black with a red glow. Both have the stats of a Deadric Bow but are slightly lighter. I might do more later but this is all I have now.\r<br />\r<br />Both are craftable under Deadric and require the Arcane Blacksmith perk\r<br />\r<br />Arcane Bow\r<br />1xQuick Silver Ingot\r<br />2xSteel Ingot\r<br />1xFilled Grand Soulgem\r<br />\r<br />Dark Arcane Bow\r<br />1xEbony Ingot\r<br />2xSteel Ingot\r<br />1xFilled Black Soulgem\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Simply copy and paste the .esp and the two folders into your Skyrim Data folder\r<br />\r<br />[b]Compatibility[/b]\r<br />\r<br />I don&#39;t see any reason this mod would conflict with anything but if anyone finds a conflict, be sure to let me know.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Permissions[/b]\r<br />\r<br />If anyone would like to use this in their own mod, that&#39;s fine just give me credit.(And if possible let me know your going to use it so I can see the mod myself)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Credits[/b]\r<br />\r<br />The meshes and textures were modified by me, but thanks to Bethesda for the originals.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Future Updates[/b]\r<br />\r<br />I plan to make more color/glow variation and would like to add some sort of magic effect holding the pieces of the bow together, but at the moment I don&#39;t know how to do that. On the off chance that someone would like to teach me how, I would be very grateful.",
