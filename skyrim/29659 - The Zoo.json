  "descriptionHtml": "Located just south of the College of Winterhold (see map).\r\nEach creature counts as an animal follower - will not interfere with your normal follower count.\r\nCreatures have 3 basic options: Follow, Wait, and Dismiss.\r\nDismissing a creature will cause it to return to The Zoo.\r\nWhen you first talk to your creature, it will seem like nothing happened - this is wrong.\r\nWhen you move around, they should follow you (barring any of their own animations).\r\nIf you first tell a creature to wait, AND THEN dismiss it, it will wait until you tell it otherwise, or three days have passed.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n",
