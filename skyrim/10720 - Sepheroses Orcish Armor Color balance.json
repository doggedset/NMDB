THIS STATEMENT OVERRIDES ANYTHING IN THE PERMISSIONS POPUP THAT IS AVAILABLE ON NEXUS THAT CONFLICTS WITH THIS STATEMENT.\r\n\r\nI always found it irritating that the Orcish armor ans the shield were so different in coloring, even though the balance of metal was so close. This is the result of my desire to see the color match between the two.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nUnrar the file into your Skyrim Data folder.\r\n-OR-\r\nDL with NMM and just let it do it\\'s thing.\r\n\r\nIf you like this, check out my other Skyrim mods:\r\n\r\nDragon Reskins: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9888\r\nDragon Auras: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9815\r\nMy Rain Retex: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11063\r\nSnow Retex: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11063",
