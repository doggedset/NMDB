  "summary": "A simple mod that adds a chance for treasure to be added to any container, this is for realisam mainly",
  "descriptionHtml": "Very simple, adds a chance of finding treasure anywhere, now bandits and other enemies will hide their precious magical weapons and gold rings in barrels, closets and even food sacks, so now you have to search to find treasures and they wont be in such obvious places anymore.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\nSimply copy the file to your skyrim/data\r\n\r\n\r\nConflicitons\r\nWill likely conflict with any more that edits the levelled lists on wardrobes, barrels and any other normal container, but seeing as few if not no mods exceot this one do that, you should be fine.\r\n\r\nYou may not upload this anywhere else, and may not include this as part of another mod, unless you ask me first. I usually give permission as long as credit is given or you allow me to help you with your mod if I take an interest in it once you ask me as I may be able to help.\r\n\r\nWorks well with my enchanted items overhaul mod, please look up my other mods",
