  "descriptionHtml": "Simply adds a convinient storage chest, as the title proclaims, along with a nifty rubbish sack, near the fast travel landing in Riverwood, right outside Alvor\\'s shop. \r\n\r\nThis is incredibly convinient for two reasons: first, it\\'s available from the beginning of the game, as soon as you finish the tutorial it\\'s the first place you end up; and second, it\\'s right by a fast travel location that you again have from the beginning of the game. \r\n\r\nNote: The mod is completely clean, so it won\\'t conflict with anything unless it modifies something in that same cell, and even then, it still may not conflict. \r\n\r\nIt only took me about 10 minutes to make. I only posted it \\'cause I thought someone else may enjoy it too! :3",
