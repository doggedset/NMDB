  "descriptionHtml": "Welcome to the Undercity, a new city located entirely underground. Has just about nearly everything a city should have and one would expect. I grew tired of travelling from city to city looking for the things I needed, not to mention travelling from city to city trying to sell all the items in my inventory. That\\'s the main focus of this mod, the merchants, and they sell more than your average merchant in your average city. Although there is a little more to the place which I will describe in greater detail a little later. There are also NPC\\'s wandering around, but for now these guys are there just to flesh out the city and give it that little bit of life, I plan on giving them simple quests in later versions. All in all there are 32+ new cells, and even more NPC\\'s. The entrance to the city is located west of Whiterun, you will be able to see the map marker but not able to fast travel to it, and is situated on a small mountain.\r\n\r\nHOW TO INSTALL\r\n\r\nClick \\'Install with Manager\\' button\r\n\r\nKNOWN BUGS\r\n\r\n*Dog in tavern attacking random NPCs - Fixed but not available in latest patch\r\n*Royal Mercenary not doing anything - This is because he is part of a WIP quest, should be out soon\r\n*Beggar not saying thank you - Rude as it is, he doesn\\'t have a sound clip of him saying thank you, I\\'m working on it\r\n*Guards armour being Steel until equipped - I\\'m looking into it, as of yet I have no solution, I will be contacting hothtrooper44 about this, as the armour is made by him\r\n\r\nLEAVE ANY FOUND BUGS IN COMMENTS\r\n\r\nI <3 CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM",
