  "descriptionHtml": "A small player home situated west of Windhelm, once populated by a poor Hunter by the name Levi Highlander.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]DISCLAIMER[/b]\r<br />This is my first mod ever, a hut built for some nice place to stay which isn&#39;t Riverwood or close to Whiterun.\r<br />I don&#39;t know much about modding, but it wasn&#39;t too hard. I&#39;ve tested it myself and it works fine for me. If you find any bugs or stuff, please tell me.\r<br />\r<br />You may not do your own things with this hut. I may allow permissions for other mods I do, but this hut is mine. If you wish to translate it, contact me because I have no idea about stuff like that.\r<br />\r<br />I know the lighting is a bit ... Strange at places, mostly around the staircase, shining through to the upper level. I don&#39;t know how to fix this. I might figure out in the future.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]What&#39;s in there?[/b]\r<br />- Smithing facilities, except Smelter\r<br />- Alchemy Table\r<br />- Enchanting Table\r<br />- Numerous Chests\r<br />- Two Beds\r<br />- Some clutter\r<br />- Shrines\r<br />- Navmesh\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]What&#39;s Not in there?[/b]\r<br />- Smelter\r<br />- Free gold (Not much at least)\r<br />- Mannequins\r<br />- Weapon Racks\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Where is it?[/b]\r<br />West of Windhelm, on the west shore of the Lake south of Bronze Water Cave. South of Nightgate Inn, North of Irkngthand.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Compatibility[/b]\r<br />As far as I know, it should be compatible with pretty much everything, since it&#39;s not close to any cities that tend to house a lot of mods.\r<br />The wood piles and the fires should work with Frostfall.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Requirements[/b]\r<br />- Skyrim (duh).\r<br />- Nothing else. No DLC&#39;s, no other mods.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Credits[/b]\r<br />Levi, without whom this Hut would not exist.\r<br />Peeh, my first tester.\r<br />",
