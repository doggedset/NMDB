  "descriptionHtml": "Updated: version 5 - please see the \\\"History\\\" section below these pages!\r\n\r\nWhy i make this mod?\r\nBetheseda make essential actor to prevent them being killed by other npc, or accident like falling damage. If you defeat them, they will regenerate health and chasing you again, and this is surely make the game unplayable. You cant start the quest carried by that actor because if you talk to them they will just attacking you. Using this mod means they can died by any cause. However, if they died you can resurrect them with console:\r\nopen console->click on the dead body->type: \\\"ressurrect 1\\\" ->press enter, after that:\r\ntype \\\"resetai\\\" -> press enter (resetai used so they wont attack you after being resurrected)\r\n\r\nWhat this mods contains & How to install?\r\nESP FILE:\r\n1. miong.esp\r\n-put in \\\"data\\\" folder, eg: D:\\\\Program Files\\\\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\ -- (put here) --\r\nPEX FILE:\r\n1. QF_DialogueMarkarthIntroWorld_000AF75F.pex\r\n2. WIDeadBodyCleanupScript.pex\r\n3. QF_MQ101_0003372B.pex\r\n-put in \\\"scripts\\\" folder, eg: D:\\\\Program Files\\\\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Scripts\\\\ -- (put here) --\r\n\r\nHistory?\r\nversion 5:\r\nFIXED: Alduin wont be died because of falling damage when landing to helgen that make the player stuck when climbing up at the helgen keep tower. \r\nFIXED: When you start new game or loading a save your actor body might become female. Its now fixed!\r\nNEW: If you start new game with this mod installed, player automatically learn 1st level of Valor Shout that summons immortal dragonborn plus 50 dragon souls to unlock it. You get this bonus only when you arrive at the scene where you have to face a bear in helgen keep cave. See the screenshot.\r\nversion 4:\r\nRecently when i visit sovngarde for my final quest i found 2 bard of sovngarde that are still essential. Also the guy named \\\"Tsun\\\" guard of sovngarde.\r\nTry to kill them yourself now: to visit sovngarde, open console and type: \\\"coc sovngarde01\\\" you will enter hall of valor full of sovngarde hero, now kill them all! The guy named \\\"Tsun\\\" are outside of valor hall, find the exit door to enter the valor courtyard to see Tsun and kill him.\r\nversion 3:\r\n1. adding required \\\"pex\\\" file (QF_DialogueMarkarthIntroWorld_000AF75F.pex), to remove ghosty flag from intro scene when you FIRST TIME entering markath, where weylin is assaulting margret. You cant harm anyone in this scene inluding those fruit shopper unless you install this pex file first!\r\nversion 2:\r\n1. adding optional \\\"pex\\\" file, so if you dont need my mod again but still want the corpse not gone away, just put the \\\"pex\\\" file inside the scripts folder.\r\n2. completed testing massacre in 2days by visiting entire holds in skyrim and shot down everyone i meet, now im sure everyone can be killed now, i found just one guy is missed but that has been fixed in this version 2. his name is Falion, he is in smalltown middle of skyrim.\r\nversion 1:\r\n1. removes essential and invulnerable tags for all actors ignoring script attached to them.\r\n2. enables you to have dozens of zombie at once (you must have master level of conjuration)\r\n3. corpse will not be cleanup, so it will spreading over the street for your vicious decoration\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n1. This mod already tested in Skyrim UNPATCHED NON-STEAM Retail version.\r\n\r\nBugs:\r\n1. Report to me: miongbesar(at)yahoo(dot)com if you find actor that still cant be killed. Just mention his name or quest title.\r\n",
