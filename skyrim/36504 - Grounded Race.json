  "descriptionHtml": "I created this mod for myself as I didn\\'t want to start out with Magicka, but to gain Magicka as I playthrough using enchanted items. I thought some people may have the same idea so I decided to upload it and give some description. I\\'ve increased some skills and upped health, stamina and carry weight to help balance out the lack of starting Magicka.\r\n\r\nUnlike many other humanoid races, the Grounded shows no Magicka potential at birth and as a result must be learnt later in life. Their physical strength makes up for what they may lack in Magicka.\r\n\r\nAdds the Grounded race. The Grounded starts with 0 Magicka 150 Health 150 Stamina and 350 Carry Weight.\r\n\r\nStat Bonuses\r\n\r\nAlchemy +14\r\nArchery +14\r\nLockpicking +14\r\nOne Handed +14\r\nSmithing +14\r\nSneak +15\r\nSpeechcraft +15",
