Or at least looked bad enough that I have to assume it was. Not only was the gulf between 6 and 7 inexplicably vast, but even close-to-the-camera bright objects like torches and fires in 7 were rather muted and didn\\'t propagate correctly, dropping off into blackness so quickly as to render them effectively useless. 7 essentially looked like 6 viewed through extremely dark sunglasses, which does not accurately capture the behavior of light in a dark environment and is not the quality of effect I\\'d grown accustomed to with CoT.\r\n\r\n--Dreogan”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[COLOR=#FFC000][SIZE=5][B]Creadits[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]\r\n\r\nAll credits go to [URL=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/1402285/] jjc71 [/URL] for his great mod [URL=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17802/] Climates Of Tamriel [/URL]",
