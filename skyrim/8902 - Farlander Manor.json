  "descriptionHtml": "***A word of warning***\r\nMy mod seems to conflict with Dovahkiin\\'s Retreat! Use This manor, OR Dovahkiin\\'s retreat!\r\n\r\n**Updated Version 1.1**\r\n- Fixed ownership of certain objects\r\n- Added More displays to the Display Hall\r\n\r\nThis is Farlander Manor, a Large house largely based on the bard\\'s college. The Manor overlooks whiterun, by the falls, Downstream from Riverwood. It has a map marker for fast travel. It has all the tools required of a full house including:\r\n- A fully stocked smithy (forge, tanning rack, sharpening wheel, craft table, smelter)\r\n- A wood storage room (with axe and chopping block\r\n- A Mage\\'s Hall (Storage, alchemy table, enchanting table) \r\n- A Display Hall (Dummies (2) and display cases so far)\r\n- A master Bedroom with Walk-in Closet, named armor/weapon/clothing/favorite gear storage closets\r\n- A kitchen with dining area and \\\"cold\\\" storage for foods and raw ingredients.\r\n- An archery practice lane.\r\n- A garden with produce and Nightshade/Deathbell outisde.\r\n\r\nOther features:\r\n- The house is guarded by 4 animated armors that will fight any hostile intruders. (if you spawn bandits inside the house, they will go after them, then return to their posts)\r\n- The house has been entirely re-navmeshed so NPCs (including guards) can navigate it without Idling.\r\n- The house was meant for role-playing a Battlemage type character, it has been furnished to accommodate roleplaying. (frost salts keep the kitchen cold storage cold, firewood storage room by the smithy to keep the fires going and so on)\r\n\r\nThe house is unfinished, but fully usable. Many Areas are still copy-Pasted from the bard\\'s college, so it may look familiar. The layout itself is identical to the bards college, save for walk-in closet and archery lane. The is also an added door to the balcony. The balcony is functional, but unfurnished.\r\n\r\nThis is my first house mod since Morrowind that i am publishing, and I am not yet experienced with the CK, If you find bugs, please report them, if you know how to fix it, please let me know.
