  "modName": "Crafting Tweaks by Mary",
  "summary": "Tweaks to crafting, especially alchemy. Includes a few new plants, recipes, etc, and provides recipes for existing items without them. Allows Dawnguard and Dragonborn flora to be planted in Hearthfire. (All 3 DLC required.)",
  "descriptionHtml": "This was originally just something I made for myself. I realized other people might enjoy some or all of the stuff I came up with, so I decided to share it. I\\'ll try to list everything I did here, but I might miss a few things since I wasn\\'t planning on sharing this in the beginning.\r\n\r\nRequires Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn.\r\n\r\nNew flora: blueberries, golden jazbay, red lichen, green lichen. (The lichen I aimed to make somewhat analogous to the Morrowind versions.) They should all be plantable in your Hearthfire planters, and they should show up in apothecary satchels and in stores. Blueberries might appear in ingredient barrels.\r\n\r\nMost (all?) Dawnguard and Dragonborn flora can be planted in your Hearthfire homes.\r\n\r\nLeeks appear in barrels now, like the other foods.\r\n\r\nClam meat, dog meat, and gourds are all ingredients now, instead of food. The food versions should only appear if other mods have physically placed those specific food items somewhere. Barrels, dead animals, clams, and gourd plants will all yield the ingredient version.\r\n\r\nOne goat hide can be turned into two leather strips at the tanning rack, a deer PELT now behaves like deer hide.\r\n\r\nAnimals will yield more ingredients. For example, trolls will have 2-5 samples of troll fat, sabre cats will have 1-2 eyes AND 1-2 teeth, bears have more claws, etc.\r\n\r\nSome ingredient containers will yield more ingredients. Spider egg sacks and slaughterfish egg nests will yield more.\r\n\r\nClams have a chance of yielding a small pearl, and a smaller chance of yielding a pearl.\r\n\r\nNew recipes, and recipes for things that already exist, including but not limited to: crab chowder, cooked boar meat, plain steamed crab legs, baked potatoes, grilled leeks, ash hopper stew, ash hopper leg roast...\r\n\r\nMore meat--chickens have two breasts (duh), cows have more beef, goats sometimes have another leg, etc.\r\n\r\nBeehives should eventually refresh. Vacant beehives still will not.\r\n\r\nSpriggans may yield spriggan sap, people occasionally yield human flesh or human hearts, spiders sometimes have eggs.\r\n\r\nSome ingredient weights have been changed--beehive husks are no longer ridiculously heavy, etc.\r\n\r\nAdded salmon scales, chicken beak, powdered horker tusk, fox tooth.\r\n\r\nLet me know if anything terrible happens, or if you have an idea or comment or whatever. Related to the mod, that is.",
