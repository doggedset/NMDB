  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i40.tinypic.com/3038i7m.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nMeet Valenca and Valerian Vanderwall, they are twins. They were born in Morrowind. When their mother found out she was pregnant, she went to a local shaman. He told her that she had two babies, one boy and one girl. When she was only about a month pregnant with them, the village she lived in was raided by vampires looking for thralls. A male vampire came in to her house and bit her, trying to make her his thrall. For some reason, however, she wouldn't turn. Frustrated, the male vampire drank some of her blood. Something tasted odd about it, so he got the vampire that was leading this raid. He tasted her blood, and could tell she was pregnant. Biting a pregnant woman has unpredictable effects, from killing the baby, to making the baby a vampire. After the ordeal was over, the woman went to find another shaman. He said that the babies were alive. When the woman gave birth to Valenca and Valerian, she wasn't too surprised to learn they were vampires. She moved to Skyrim with them, hoping that they would be allowed in to Castle Volkihar. They were rejected, so the mother was forced to abduct humans for her children to feed on, until they could do it themselves. Their mother, not being a vampire herself, died of old age while Valenca and Valerian were still \"children\" (of course, they were over 60 years old, but they looked like children.) That all happened very long ago.\r\n\r\nNow they can be found in Whiterun's Hall of The Dead Catacombs.\r\n\r\n[b]This mod requires Apachii Skyhair.\r\nIn the first pictures, Valenca is in her default robes. In the other pictures she is wearing a custom armor I downloaded.[/b]\r\n\r\nIf you have an idea for a follower, send me a request.\r\n\r\nAlso, check out [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/46043/?]Lorae and Kayla[/url].\r\n\r\nCredit goes to Bethesda, and Apachii.",
