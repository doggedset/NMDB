No other mods or DLCs are required to use this mod, and it's fully compatible with all my mods. Mods like Andromeda and Aurora, which also amend the Standing Stones, will be incompatible. Standing Stones added by other mods to new locations (e.g. new player homes) will have their mesh files replaced and will look strange, but this is to ensure a smooth installation and the option to uninstall bug-free. They will also still grant you the vanilla blessings, so for a balanced playthrough I'd recommend avoiding them.\n<br />[/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]http://www.imageupload.co.uk/images/2018/04/15/THESTONES.png[/img]\n<br />[color=#f9cb9c][size=3][b]The Standing Stones of Skyrim now offer consistent, powerful and balanced blessings that I've created based on in-game effects from various Elder Scrolls games and lore descriptions of the constellations and the powers associated with them.[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />The blessings of the Guardian Stones and their Charges now include updated passive abilities that are more powerful but come at the cost of weaknesses. The Charge Stones (i.e. all Stones except the Guardians and the Serpent) have the greatest weaknesses, but they also grant Greater Powers for use once a day. The Serpent Stone is unusual and has an effect unique amongst the Standing Stones.\n<br />\n<br />When you first load this mod, your current blessing will be detected and replaced with the new blessing, so no new playthrough is required to run this mod. As a new feature, if you try to receive a blessing you already have, you will be given the option to remove the blessing.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#f6b26b]PRESS THE SPOILER BUTTON BELOW TO VIEW\n<br />ALL CHANGES TO THE STANDING STONE BLESSINGS[/color][/size][/b][/center]\n<br />[spoiler][size=2]\n<br />[center][b][color=#e06666][size=5]The Warrior[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />Your combat skills are 20% more effective and increase \n<br />20% faster.
