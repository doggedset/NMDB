  "descriptionHtml": "* Sparrow is now a follower! *\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27094\r\n\r\n\r\n* Backstory * - Updated\r\nHe has a twin and that is why he in the first place was caught on the border to Skyrim. After sometime searching for his twin in other provinces, he ended up in Skyrim. But his twin brother doesn\\'t know about him and Sparrow did just recently (nine months ago) learned that he had a twin brother that was separated from him at birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n* The Beginning *\r\nYou\\'ve escaped from your death sentence and from a dragon attack on Helgen. And now you have the freedom to do what you want in Skyrim.\r\n- Sundas, 2:33 PM, 17th of Last Seed, 4E 201\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name Sparrow he got when he was little, for they would always find him in the trees in Valenwood and because he was the smallest of all the children playing there.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy personal comments about this save:\r\nBy going through the quest Unbound, did Sparrow only use his magic spells (Flames & Healing).\r\nOn his way out he found a few things that he could sell later if he survived, as most people need food and shelter when ending up in a foregin province.\r\n\r\n\r\n* So what will become of Sparrow? *\r\n\r\n\r\nFrequently asked questions:\r\nQ | Does the saved game have any mods\\\\DLC turned on(connected) with it?\r\nA | No :)",
