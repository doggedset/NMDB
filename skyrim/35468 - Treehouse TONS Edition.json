  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg612/KaizMK/TONSpresents.jpg[/img]\r\n[b][size=5]Treehouse With the TONS Touch[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nalso check out:\r\n\r\n[b][size=3][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35466/]TreeHouse Final Version Fixes by TONS[/url][/size][/b][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][size=5][b]INTRODUCTION[/b][/size][/u] (feel free to skip this part as there is no useful info here)\r\n\r\nIn all my searching for a player abode, I saw a lot of good ones and even a few greats, but I have very specific tastes and whatnots and basically only ended up with two of them.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12084/]The Treehouse Final Version by meowmixyum[/url] was one of them and I loved this house, but I decided to do a bit of remodeling of this great idea.\r\n\r\nI don\\'t know what I\\'m doing. I can\\'t read or write. I thought the word \\\"mod\\\" was short for modem and was wondering why everyone was making modems for Skyrim when they didn\\'t have the internet back then.\r\n\r\nBut I tried to do this anyway. Keep that in mind when you tell me stuff that is wrong  because I will try to fix it but there is like a 137% chance that I will not only crash Skyrim trying to fix it but also the entire WWW.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[u][size=5][b]SOME CHANGES[/b][/size][/u]\r\n\r\n - [color=red]Now I can build a birdhouse and enchant it with a ward spell all in the same place[/color]... all the crafting stuff is on the same floor. I need things that way cause I distract easily. I was going upstairs to enchant the sandwich (so that it would taste better) I just toasted on the forge (also so it would taste better) and some how ended up chasing butterflies.\r\n\r\n - [color=red]Hircine now tries to get the other deities to play twister[/color]... I couldn\\'t let Mara sit there in between Malocath and Talos as it would be a matter of time before they would do stuff so I decided to make this a hunter\\'s place to be and Hircine is the top dog when it comes to hunting but I figured a hunter, even though they would revere Hircine the most would also have a special place in their quiver for Kynereth who is all about nature, Arkay who is about life and death which is sort of like balance and Meridia, because she scares me - I mean because she is about the natural order of things being in place and thus smacks undead around.\r\n\r\n - [color=red]After I was featured on an episode of Horders: Skyrim addition, I decided to make some changes in my life[/color]... I cleared a lot of stuff out and then I went crazy with it and at one point even tossed myself out from the second floor of this house. Long story short, the place has a little less things in it. I think.\r\n\r\n- [color=red]It would have been a long diving board[/color]... but a quarter way through the construction, I remembered that I was lazy and turned it into a short balcony instead.\r\n\r\n- [color=red]I needed something to fall back on in case this dragonborn thing didn\\'t work out[/color]... I decided I would be an interior decorator and decided that I would be my first customer and rearranged a few things. Man do I want my money back.\r\n\r\n- [color=red]I\\'m lazy[/color]... in case you missed it. But yeah, I am. There\\'s other stuff I changed, but I am too lazy to list them all so you\\'ll have to download them and see it for yourself.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[u][size=5][b]WHAT YOU NEED[/b][/size][/u]\r\n\r\n - [color=red]An abacus[/color]... you still don\\'t need one, but I still like that word.\r\n\r\n - [color=red]A Mainfile[/color]... There\\'s one without 3rd floor access and one with third floor access (and there are some stuff to enjoy on the third floor) so pick one or both, but don\\'t run both at the same time.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[u][size=5][b]SOME KNOWN ISSUES[/b][/size][/u]\r\n\r\n - [color=red]Night at the Museum[/color]... this place does a ton of weird stuff if you just walk up to it like the mannequins come to life and some of them aren\\'t exactly people so, yeah.\r\n\r\n - [color=red]I don\\'t have happy feet[/color]... on the stairs anyway. Of course the stairs work but that stutter step thing annoys me.\r\n\r\n - [color=red]Dagger cases sometimes hold on to things [u]too[/u] well[/color]... Sometimes it takes my dagger and doesn\\'t let me take it back.\r\n\r\n- [color=red]When using an optional file or two, sometimes Skyrim makes the Treehouse have babies[/color]... Most of the time I don\\'t have this issue but on occasion the Treehouse gets doubled on top of itself. [color=gold]I\\'m not sure if you have to do all this to fix it, but I restart Skyrim and that works for me.[/color]\r\n\r\n - [color=red]If you wait around in the same area as the Treehouse, the mannequins may try to escape again and end up in weird places[/color]... loading through an interior and coming back fixes this for me as well when it does happen.\r\n\r\n - [color=gold]Note: Except for the stairs things, most of these issues will be fine if you just load to an interior and then back to Skyrim[/color].\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[u][size=5][b]UPDATES[/b][/size][/u]\r\n\r\n  If I ever have any or if I come up with any good \\\"Yo Momma\\\" jokes, I will put them here.\r\n\r\n[i]*Disclaimer: I will not be posting \\\"Yo Momma\\\" jokes of any kind*[/i]\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[u][size=5][b]Other Recommended Mods[/b][/size][/u]\r\n(I have plenty of mods, more than I could count but I wanted to recommend these few for now)\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26393/]Vilja in Skyrim[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20924/]Ambrosia Fashions[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1002/]JaySuS Swords[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666/]Calientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition -CBBE-[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22612/]Battledress Female Mage Robe[/url]\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[u][size=5][b]CREDITS/THANK YOU[/b][/size][/u]\r\n\r\n- [color=gold]meowmixyum[/color], for making the original mod. My mod would have never happened without yours\r\n\r\n- [color=gold]Nexus site[/color], for making stuff so easy even a caveman can do it because that caveman then was able to teach me some things though he says I have a long way to go till \\\"me not novice anymore and hammer strong\\\"\r\n\r\n- [color=gold]Emma[/color], your Vilja mod inspired me to switch from Skyrim on the PS3 to Skyrim on the PC and now I have to attend a support group once a week for people addicted to mods. That aside, I am glad you got me into this world as I\\'ve never enjoyed Skyrim so much\r\n\r\n- [color=gold]GophersVids[/color], before I started watching your VERY detailed tutorials, all joking aside, I didn\\'t know what mod order was or what to do about it or anything that had to do with this stuff. Needless to say, I could not even play Skyrim at first after I loaded it with so many mods in the wrong order and that were incompatible. LOL You changed that and I am glad that are those who do tutorials with the understanding that some of us (me) have no idea what we\\'re doing so we need things explained as much as possible. Now I am responsible for my load order.\r\n\r\n- [color=gold]LouisAT444[/color], once I started to, at least, be able to spell the word \\\"mod\\\" correctly I was ready for your tutorials. I don\\'t know how you do it but your videos are short and yet very thorough and I can just follow along. \r\n\r\n- [color=gold]Shawkab[/color], I was so mad with navmeshing (and search engines as I could not find the answer ANYWHERE) when I could not connect two points or ends at this one spot no matter what I did that I went outside and punched a baby. Thanks to your second video on navmeshing, I no longer hit infants which is good for our future. \r\n\r\n- [color=gold]MMOxReview[/color], for Skyrim Mods Weekly your show is so funny and great that it was worth the 68 times I crashed Skyrim because of it. Your show had me download so many mods that it caused my fish tank in real life to stop working, but yeah you get credit for me modding as well.\r\n\r\n- [color=gold]You[/color], for being here. Whether you download this or not, whether you endorse me or not, I am thankful for you stopping by and hope that I make something you like in the future.",
