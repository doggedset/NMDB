I can&#39;t put everything I did here, too long\r<br />2. So many stuff and future plans are in there also my excuses why it took forever\r<br />3. There&#39;s a nifty surprise inside&#33; and no, it&#39;s not pony sorry :(\r<br />\r<br />**NOTICE**\r<br />\r<br />I am picking this up again, working from v1.1 I&#39;ve uploaded, expect at least a week before\r<br />you will see new update.\r<br />\r<br />New update will be focused on finishing whiterun and starting riften&#39;s general area (this excludes the rat&#39;s way).\r<br />\r<br />Latest Kill count (at least I try to keep up with this, I might miss a bunch along the way)\r<br />\r<br />Added:\r<br />Fake lights fixes: 396\r<br />Window lights interior: 142\r<br />Fire based light source lights: 189\r<br />External window: 285\r<br />Trees: 38\r<br />Shrubs: 31\r<br />Candles 53\r<br />External light statics: 38\r<br />Removed:\r<br />Lights: 217\r<br />Candles: 42\r<br />\r<br />==IMPORTANT==\r<br />I have yet to figure out a work-around for skyrim&#39;s engine light limit, so you will periodically see lights doesn&#39;t properly work until you come close\r<br />\r<br />If you notice any buggy lighting, please let me know in the comments,\r<br />Thank you,\r<br />-ZiP",
