  "descriptionHtml": "I felt that something was missing in Dragonborn DLC so i made this little mod to make things right. Bethesda never thought about people who wanted to use Mage Armor perk, but also get advantages of Miraak&#39;s mask.\r<br />\r<br />Mask was renamed MiraakFines just to make some difference, if you want to get it , just type  &#39;help miraakfines&#39; in  console, and you&#39;ll get mask id and you can add it.",
