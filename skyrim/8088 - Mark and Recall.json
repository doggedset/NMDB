  "descriptionHtml": "French Translation by Sharanis Khan: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11763\r\n\r\n\r\nAdds Adept Conjuration/Apprentice Alteration spells and scrolls similar to Morrowinds Mark and Recall \r\n\r\nThe always eager Alteration Mages are able to learn this spell very early and use it efficiently as an Apprentice\r\nThe reckless Conjuration Magic lacks the concentration required for this difficult spell and so they have to become an Adept in order to learn it\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are able to Recall (teleport) yourself back to where you used Mark\r\n\r\nTo prevent glitches those spells normally only work in places, where fast travel would work (if you know what you are doing read below)\r\n\r\n-> To make it work it anywhere (and with disabled fasttravel) open the console and type:\r\n     set AllowRecall to 1\r\n\r\nHowever with this command enabled you can break many things with that so only use the spell where you deem it save and not while in the middle of a quest (event)\r\n\r\nMerchants who sell conjuration spells should have it in stock after you reach 50 in conj (may take a day or so for their inventory to restock)\r\nYou may find the alteration version at vendors very early.\r\n\r\nAdditionally Brand Shei in Riften always sells the fine scrolls from Morrowind\r\n\r\nThis Mod currently has 3 Versions:\r\n\r\n-Complete: Identical to the one on Steam. Spells are available in both schools\r\n-Alteration: Only Scrolls and Apprentice Alteration Spells\r\n-Conjuration: Only Scrolls and Adept Conjuration Spells\r\n\r\nNEW IN VERSION 4:\r\n-Better dual casting effect\r\n-Alteration version\r\n-Fixing a scroll bug with version 3 -.-\r\n\r\nNEW IN VERSION 2:\r\n-Increased spell mana cost, but is now properly affected by perk\r\n-Now works while being over carry capacity\r\n-There are now scrolls of the spells sold at the same locations as the books for a base value of 25 each (however without skill requirement)\r\n-Caution these scrolls get used up even if they fail to work (this will probably be changed in the future)\r\n-Additionally Brand Shei in Riften now always sells these fine scrolls from Morrowind\r\n\r\n-If you are sure you know what you are doing you can now enable mark and recall to work anywhere\r\nCAUTION: THIS WILL BREAK QUESTS IF USED IN THE WRONG PLACES\r\nopen the console and type:\r\n\r\nset AllowRecall to 1\r\n\r\nhit Enter\r\n\r\nComing up:\r\n-Make the save version work inside city interiors where it is generally save\r\n",
