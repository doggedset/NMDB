  "descriptionHtml": "After Tolfdir&#39;s first lesson, I was sorely disappointed at how the College of Winterhold Questline degenerated into &#34;Go to place A, hit everything with a sword, come back. Repeat.&#34; Worst of all was that you didn&#39;t even really learn anything about magic.  Tolfdir taught you a little about wards. Woo. And you had to pay for everything. Wasn&#39;t this supposed to be a free learning environment? My aim is to make the College what it should have been. Multiple lectures from all of the major schools in Skyrim, with tangible benefits. Reading the course books and attending lectures will provide skill in the respective school. Oh, and there will be tests ;) So grab your pointy hats and spell books, class starts at 9am. ",
