  "summary": "A player home with Riften style architecture.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Location: The player home is located between Northwind Summit and Sarithi Farm\r\nV1.1. \r\n- Added a well outside the home\r\n- Added stable outside the home\r\n- Added a path that branches off from the road between Northwind Summit and Sartithi Farm\r\n- Fixed some interior issues and exterior issue\\'s\r\n- Fixed the main door \\\"was slighty off\\\"\r\n- Added a screen shot of the location\r\n\r\n*This update contains the new esp. Overwrite the old one when you drag it into your data folder.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n**************\r\nAzura\\'s Rest is a player home suitable for all types of game play. It has a Riften style feel to the home with 2 floors. First floor is the living and alchemy area. Basement level is the blacksmith and enchanting area. There is a note outside the home player\\'s should read explaining the story of the home. \r\n\r\nNote:  \\\"Working on some small fixes in the home and adding some new things outside the home\\\"\r\n******\r\nThis is my very first mod. It started out just messing around with the creation kit and 1 week later this pop\\'ed out of it. I tested the mod a couple of times. I do not see anything to be wrong with it. Everything in the home is Vanilla. I am assuming there might be issue\\'s with it so i would greatly appreciate feedback on it. I did my best with the lighting in the home also. Oh yeah there is no navmesh in the home for NPC\\'s to walking in the home. I have not found a decent guide for building one yet. Will do in the future if this mod is a success.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n***********\r\n\r\n- Map Marker for fast travel\r\n- Comes complete with Anvil, Alchemy Table, Enchanting Table, and 1 Smelter\r\n- Outdoor Wood Chopping Block with axe\r\n- Cooking Pot in the kitchen\r\n- Plenty of Storage Space\r\n- 2 Mannequins\r\n- 1 Weapon Rack\r\n- 4 Weapon Plaques\r\n- Awesome location with a view of Windhelm and Throat of The World.\r\nInstallation:\r\n*************\r\n- Extract .ESP to your Data folder. Make sure it is checked in your Skyrim Launcher.\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\n*******************\r\n- Simply Delete \\\"Azura\\'s Rest.ESP\\\" from your data folder\r\n\r\n",
