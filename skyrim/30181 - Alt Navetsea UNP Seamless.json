I also matched up the normal texture maps lower neck muscles with the upper body muscles where they meet a little better. And additionally used yllib's nice little discovery 'No More Ugly Bronze Shine' ( The _sk textures have been replaced so you do not have those strange shifting shiny lines on female body textures typically when stood next to a light source indoors ).\n<br />\n<br />This mod also includes DIMONIZED UNP female body 'meshes' ( 1.2, B2 and Skinny, and some hand options .. Selectable during the installation ).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />You do not need anything from the original mods for this to work.\n<br />\n<br />But you will need armor and clothing meshes to fit this body mesh ( see the Recommended Mods section after the Installation section of this description ).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Have a look at the screenshots, I chose locations / lighting conditions in game which would normally highlight the problem with the original textures. I did not use any ENB so that you can see how they look with vanilla lighting, and no strange ini settings to 'artificially enhance' how they look. Vilja was very helpful too patiently standing around for shots ( I use Vilja's No Unique Face mesh, so that she uses these textures instead of her custom ones for head and body )\n<br />\n<br />It does not include Navetseas Basvanbeu plugin which Navetsea used to load up multiple different body textures to distribute different pubic variations throughout the games NPCs .. I do not have permission for that which I understand was a private arrangement.\n<br />And I have not included the Navetsea presets for your player character selection at character generation time on a new game. If you want the face presets esp, go and grab Navetseas, it will work with this mod too.\n<br />\n<br />And lastly, it does not touch any files to do with males, or beasts ( Argonian / Khajiit - See Recommended mods below ).[/size][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=6]Installation[/size][/center]\n<br />[center][spoiler]\n<br />[size=5]Choose ONE of the main files :\n<br />\n<br />HIGH = 4096 textures - 1gb Graphics card or above\n<br />LITE = 2048 vanilla sized textures - 512mb Graphics card or above\n<br />REDUCED = 1024 Lower res than vanilla - 512mb Graphics cards with a heavy load of mods\n<br />SEVERE = Made for me (Yey! I get to use it too), anyone familiar with my [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14504]Vanilla Reduced Textures[/url] mod will know they are at home with this version. Its for my 256mb VRAM beast of a laptop :P\n<br />\n<br />If you use Nexus Mod Manager ( NMM ) - The scripted installation will walk you through the options.\n<br />\n<br />If you use Wrye Bash - Its a Wizard installer. So drop it in the Bash Installers folder, then load up Wrye Bash and find it in the Installers Tab, right click and choose 'Wizard'.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://static-1.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/30181-2-1359818817.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://static-1.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/30181-1-1359818816.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]Traditional manual methods of installing these files should not be a problem for those that know how, screenshots of choices are in FOModImages\n<br />Also if manually installing, and you wish to use Nuska's Face options, do not overwrite them with the face addons, or Darker liptint Mask ( there will be lip misalignment if you do ), the installers only allow compatible mixes of these textures.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=6]There is no plugin ( esp or esm ), so the mod does not need to be 'ticked' anywhere, its the same as UNP and Navatseas files ie they replace vanilla game files, and are installed as loose files ( Note: Which can be overwritten by other loose file replacers, so dont blame me if your setup looks wrong. )\n<br />\n<br />This mod assumes you have no other loose mesh or texture files which affect female bodies or faces, to work correctly. It can be used with others, but thats down to how advanced you are with modding Skyrim. Also any mods which affect the same files but are packaged in a BSA, then my files will win being loose files, and override the look of that mod ).\n<br />\n<br />Screenshots uploaded by users which are obviously a mixture of mods causing problems will be deleted as un-representative of this mod. There is a 'slight' problem with hands tone not matching the arms perfectly as there is with Navetseas originals ( I have not touched hands yet, and have not claimed to ).[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]Also: Refer to your Mod Manager of choice documentation.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=6]Un-Installation[/size]\n<br />[size=5]---------------[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]Reverse the process you used to install it :P, if you installed this manually without NMM or Wrye Bash, you will need to delete all the individual files you installed from the meshes and textures folders.[/size]\n<br />[/spoiler][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=6]Recommended mods[/size][/center]\n<br />[center][spoiler]\n<br />[size=5]If you are using any kind of UNP female body meshes and textures, like this mod, then you are going to need UNP female armour and clothing ..\n<br />\n<br />Exeters [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7305]UNP Female Armors[/url]\n<br />And for people with Dawnguard installed [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22033]UNP Dawnguard armors[/url]\n<br />And for people with Dragonborn installed [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31392]UNP Dragonborn Armors[/url]\n<br />And for people using the Skinny mesh [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21776]UNP Female Skinny Armors[/url]\n<br />\n<br />And .. any Armour or Clothing mods which are designed for the original Dimon UNP, will fit Alt Navetsea UNP Seamless.\n<br />\n<br />Female beasts ( Argonian and Khajiit ) for UNP are not included in this mod, so you need something like Mr Daves [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11400]UNP Khajiit and Argonian Hotfix[/url] to finish off the whole UNP Female setup.\n<br />There is also [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4962]Kisa Khajiit Nude Fur Textures[/url] by KisaFayd.\n<br />\n<br />Edit : See also a couple of new mods in various resolutions for Beasts :\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62574/?]Feminine Argonian Textures for UNP[/url] by MONSTERaider\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62193/?]Feminine Khajiit Textures for UNP[/url] by MONSTERaider\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />For anyone using my mod with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26393]Vilja in Skyrim[/url] then have a look in Vilja's optional files for \"No Unique Face\", the head mesh in that will make Vilja use whatever body mod head textures you use .. So you will have Vilja using both my body textures and my head textures and they will match seamlessly. ( I also gave Emma and the team the optional file \"Vilja Skyrim Custom Eyes by Alt3rn1ty\" in the optional files there, its an installer for NMM / Wrye Bash just like Alt Navetsea UNP Seamless, and gives you a choice of 67 different eye colours for Vilja ).\n<br />If you are using the Nuska options for face textures in my mod .. When Vilja asks \"Do I have Freckles ?\" you can say no .. ( but I would cover your grin with your hand :) )\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Also for general Tweaking of the game :\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69787/?]Skyrim Project INI[/url] ( SpINI )\n<br />The most comprehensively researched Tweaking advice ever conducted for any Bethesda game, in a smart utility.[/size]\n<br />[/spoiler][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=6]What!, no comments ?[/size][/center]\n<br />[center][spoiler]\n<br />[size=5]\"May the fleas of a thousand camels infest his armpits .. WHERE DO WE MOAN AT YOU ???\"\n<br />Sorry, switched em off. They just fill up with mess which needs moderated and requests I will not be doing. I do not have Navetseas artistic talent, or source files to work with either, so any work on these textures will degrade them the more they are edited for requests. Comments too invariably are neither civil or helpful for development on nexus, especially with body mods. The installer should be simple enough, any problems combining this mod with other body / head mods / loose files / install order etc are yours.\n<br />\n<br />If you dont like it, dont install it, walk on and do your own.\n<br />\n<br />Otherwise, Enjoy.[/size]\n<br />[/spoiler][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=6]Tools used to make this:[/size][/center]\n<br />[center][spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][url=http://www.gimp.org]G.I.M.P[/url]\n<br />[url=https://code.google.com/p/gimp-dds]DDS Plugin for GIMP[/url]\n<br />[url=https://code.google.com/p/gimp-normalmap]Normal Map Plugin for GIMP[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.7-zip.org]7 Zip[/url]\n<br />[url=http://notepad-plus-plus.org]Notepad++[/url]\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5755]DDSOpt[/url] ( But only for re-mipping everything - Normals were kept uncompressed ( to stop any artifacting ) )[/size]\n<br />[/spoiler][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=6]Credits[/size][/center]\n<br />[center][spoiler]\n<br />[size=5]Credit where credits due, and a big thank you to Dimon for UNP meshes, and Navetsea for the beautiful textures, if you use this mod go and give them an endorsement as thanks for the artistry applied to the originals which I have taken advantage of, and their relaxed permissions...\n<br />\n<br />Dimon99's [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709]DIMONIZED UNP female body[/url] meshes.\n<br />Navetsea's [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6554]CBBE skin texture V2 V3 plus Thepal and UNP compatible[/url] textures.\n<br />Nuska for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28645]Real Skin for Women - Navetsea / Freckles face[/url] textures.\n<br />yllib for this idea - [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29791]No More Ugly Bronze Shine[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/5006868]ShadowGearX[/url] - Testing pre-release\n<br />My patient eldest daughter x - Even more testing\n<br />Lorelai ( BGS Forum ) - Some very valuable tips and testing ( And the main reason you are all getting an update ;) )[/size]\n<br />[/spoiler][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=6]Permissions[/size][/center]\n<br />[center][spoiler]\n<br />[size=5]See the original authors permissions linked in the credits above.
