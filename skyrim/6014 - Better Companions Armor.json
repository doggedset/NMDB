  "descriptionHtml": "I like the companions, but I don\\'t like that their faction armor, the armor worn by most of the Circle, has the same stats as basic steel.  What I\\'ve done is a very simple buff to the armor, making it the same armor rating as steel plate.  Now, because you can buy this armor after doing the first 2 quests for the companions, I\\'ve also added more weight (slightly less than steel plate now), and higher price (slightly more than steel plate now).  It\\'s still a little unbalanced, considering how early in the game you can obtain it, but not game breakingly.  (I hope...)",
