  "descriptionHtml": "A level 1 nord, with no XP (except half a level of lockingpicking) that has finished quests up to getting The Horn Of Jurgen Windcaller. So you&#39;ll have the full unrelenting force shout, whirlwind spirit (first word), 1 dragon soul and the golden claw quest item. As soon as you open the save you can progress like a brand new character.  Just open the console using ¬ then type &#34;showracemenu&#34; and you can create your own character thats completely blank. You&#39;ll have only 4 map markers: Riverwood, Whiterun, Whiterun Stables and High Hrothgar.\r<br />\r<br />During the unbound quest, I followed hadvar into the keep. So you can go back to riverwood and talk to Alvor for a few extra items if you wanted them.\r<br />\r<br />Requires all 3 DLC&#39;s (Who doesn&#39;t have them anyway?)\r<br />\r<br />The only equipment you have is a small sum of gold and full iron armour with an iron sword and an iron shield, a few health potions and thats it.\r<br />\r<br />Extract to your Skyrim saves folder (Mine is in My Documents/My Games/Skyrim)",
