  "descriptionHtml": "[center][youtube]l2LmOf9kJD8[/youtube][/center]\r\n\r\n[size=7][b][u]That's right, ladies and gentlemen, it's finally here![/u][/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[size=4]Minecraft.[/size] [size=5]In.[/size] [size=6]Skyrim![/size] [size=1](Not to be confused with [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=80592162&searchtext=minecraft]Minecraft in Skyrim[/url], which is completely different and has no legal affiliation with Minecraft mod for Skyrim or its creator)[/size]\r\n\r\nThis mod adds the ability to play (a rudimentary version of) Minecraft from within Skyrim by traveling a short distance away from Riverwood and finding a Strange Cube.\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Warning: This is a novelty mod, and as such is not meant to be used on personal saves. If you do decide to use it on a save you use to play the game regularly, I would highly recommend making a backup of it, just in case![/b][/size]\r\n\r\nCurrently in version 1.0, there are stone, cobblestone, wood, log, dirt, grass, leaf, and sapling blocks, as well as a static chest and workbench. Craftable tools are wooden axes, pickaxes, and shovels. The mod includes three downloads corresponding to different world sizes (Large worlds may lag your computer!).\r\n\r\n[size=4][b][u]Known issues (Bugs that cannot be fixed, as far as I know):[/u][/b][/size]\r\n• You cannot place blocks while jumping.\r\n• Your tool reach is significantly smaller than in the actual Minecraft game.\r\n• Attempting to place blocks while pointing near the edge of a block face will sometimes fail to place the block or place it on the wrong side.\r\n\r\n[size=4][b][u]Known long-term bugs (Bugs that can potentially be fixed, but I'm not entirely certain how to do it yet):[/u][/b][/size]\r\n• Trees can grow inside other blocks.\r\n• Grass does not spread.\r\n• The tools have no inner-face (If someone would mind modeling the tools and giving me the .nif files, I'd be greatly obliged. The way that I export models from Blender messes up the UVs, and I have to fix them by had, which just isn't something I can do on a model that complex).\r\n\r\n[size=4][b][u]Known short-term bugs (Bugs that can likely be fixed within the next update):[/u][/b][/size]\r\n• Bedrock has no texture.",
