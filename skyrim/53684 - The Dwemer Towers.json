  "summary": "Dwemer home, partially above/below ground. Includes home, training area, display area and even a small zoo&#33; REQUIRES Dawnguard and Dragonborn&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod requires both Dawnguard and Dragonborn&#33; My first mod, a mostly underground dwemer player home with some unique additions including a training area, a display area, an explorable sunken tower and even a small zoo&#33; The home is found north-west of Falkreath in the lake. It includes the standard amenities, a crafting area(atop the tower), enchanting/alchemy area. It also includes a library, kitchen/dining room and a bathroom with working shower/tub. I&#39;ve included a large display area with mannequins and a unique magic weapon display(shown in pictures.) The display rooms include a small civil war room and a large area for storing daedric artifacts and also a dragon room with spots for your dragon priest masks and dragon claws. There is also a training area, complete with an arena-type room where you can spawn various enemies to fight you or each other. The training room also includes a gauntlet, a special challenge just for the player with a nice reward at the end. The bestiary(or zoo) houses Skyrim&#39;s various beasts for your viewing pleasure. I tried to make this mod as lore friendly as possibly, but I&#39;m no expert&#33; The house is done, however I may eventually add more to the mod, like servants and guards and perhaps a quest to go along with the home. It&#39;s my first mod, and constructive feedback is more than welcome, also let me know if there&#39;s anything you&#39;d like to see added, just don&#39;t be a dick about it. :) \r<br />\r<br />Special thanks to Tbrough10 and mkprovince for feedback/testing.\r<br />\r<br />NOTE: this mod shouldn&#39;t conflict with other mods except mods that modify the real estate around the lake northwest of Falkreath. Ex: The Moon and Stars mod. \r<br />\r<br />UPDATES\r<br />Version 1.1 \r<br />I updated the Navmesh in multiple areas so it should be more follower friendly, I&#39;d still maybe leave them behind for the gauntlet in the training rooms and the sunken tower though. \r<br />\r<br />I also changed the bestiary(zoo). It&#39;s no longer one large room as this was causing lag for some users, it is now two separate rooms, I&#39;ve also removed the rabbits as separating the rooms made it necessary, they didn&#39;t do anything anyway. :) ",
