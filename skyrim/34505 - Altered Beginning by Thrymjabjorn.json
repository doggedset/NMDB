  "descriptionHtml": "This is not my mod. This mod was created by Thrymjabjorn and I have not seen it anywhere on the Nexus. It is a very nice alternative for those not wanting to run through the entire Helgen scene again. It will start off like the vanilla start but instead of getting up and running from the dragon you black out and awake several hours later.\r\n\r\nNo quest are forced by this mod except \"Rebound\", but the main quest can easily be started by talking to the Jarl of Whiterun.\r\n\r\nYou MUST start a completely new save. You cannot use an old save to skip the intro, the mod will not work then. Start a new save, going through the carriage scene and such, it should then work fine. If not then there may be something in the scripts folder causing it to act up.",
