  "summary": "Gives a realistic weight to the common gold coin and renames it to the Septim.  Use caution.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A small mod that gives the standard gold coin some weight, and renames it to Septim rather than just \\'Gold\\'.  The coin now weighs 0.014  lbs (6.5g).  The game won\\'t display a decimal that small (still shows \\'0\\' for its weight), but you will notice the effect on your weight.  What this means is that you will now longer be able to carry around a fortune in gold without having to pay for it somehow.  Make sure you are in your home and standing next to a chest before activating this mod! (Also take a companion along with you to help carry the load if you plan on buying Proudspire Manor)\r\n\r\nUse only if you\\'re looking to impose some limits on yourself.\r\n\r\nI opted to use to the Roman aureus coin as the base as it seemed to be the closest historical example of the TES Septim.  (I also opted for the later and slighter lighter weight of 6.5g rather than its earlier weight of 8g, just to make it a little easier). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus\r\n\r\nLet me know if there are any problems with it.\r\n\r\nIncompatability:  Would be incompatable with any other mod that modifies the attributes of the gold coin.",
