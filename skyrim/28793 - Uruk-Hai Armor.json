  "descriptionHtml": "firstly, sorry for the long wait.\r\n\r\nand please read the full discription before asking any questions.\r\n\r\nI still need to make the gaunlets and boots.\r\n\r\nThanks to Preykousis for the \\'Mod of the Day\\' review! \r\n\r\n[youtube]1JhHFOEPRZM[/youtube]\r\n\r\nbut thanks to TheFrenchTickler it finally works ingame!\r\n\r\nbecause of some people asking, I activated the \\'\\'install with mod manager\\'\\' thing..   I don\\'t know if it wil work becasue there are 2 seperate folders in the file (discibed below)\r\nso if it doesn\\'t work, just download the .rar file, extract it, and put the \\'\\'data\\'\\' folder of your desired version into your skyrim folder.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 versions in the .rar file:\r\n- a stand alone armor\r\n- a complete package with all my uruk-hai mods and the armor\r\n\r\nIn case you are using the complete package, I recommend disabling my other uruk-hai mods, i have not tested it, but I guess they will interfere with each other.\r\n\r\nthis said, I noticed all my mods interfere with eachother... so just use the complete package haha :\\')\r\n\r\nto intall:\r\nextract the file, choose the one you want, and drop the data folder into your skyrim folder\r\n\r\nit\\'s craftable in the orcisch catagory\r\n\r\nand I know it\\'s not completely accurate to the movies\r\n\r\nmaking it work ingame/making the package by TheFrenchTickler\r\nmodel and textures by me\r\n\r\none other thing people! \r\nI decline any requests for changing little details. \r\nI am not as dedicated as other modders and I\\'m just too damn lazy.\r\neverything I make is mainly for myself. I just like to make things from time to time.\r\nSorry to everyone who\\'d wish to have little details changed.\r\nI\\'m happy with it as it is.\r\nand again, I make it for myself. I\\'m just uploading because others would like it too.\r\nIf you really really really can\\'t live with a little detail thats killing you. I suggest using the internet to your advantage and learn it yourself. You\\'ll only gain from it. it\\'s fun to create things :D",
