  "summary": "Hey! This is just a quick retexture of the Blades Katana to give it a more stealthy feeling, it works well with \\\"Nightingale Prime.\\\" The blade is also given a darker look. The sheath is also changed to make it darker with a silver tip to match Nightingale.",
  "descriptionHtml": "FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO REPLACE THE NIGHTINGALE BLADE, REFER TO MY OTHER MOD:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3921\r\n\r\nHey! This is just a quick retexture of the Blades Katana to give it a more stealthy feeling, it works well with \\\"Nightingale Prime.\\\" I also use a mod to increase the damage to the same damage as a Daedric Sword. Below are the are the mod links. \r\n\r\nOne file has the jagged black texture version, the other one eliminates the jaggedness to give the sword a stealthier look.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Because the \\\"Dragonbane\\\" uses the same texture path, the Dragonbane blade will look like this as well.\r\n\r\nTo get this weapon, go to your console by hitting the \\\"~\\\" key. Then type in:\r\nplayer.additem 3AEB9 1\r\n\r\nAlternatively, this sword can be retrieved from [SPOILER START] Skyhaven Temple during the main quest in one of the chests. [SPOILER END].\r\n \r\nNightingale Prime: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1896\r\nBlades Sword Damage Increase: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2362\r\n\r\nIf anyone would like to retexture this, you are welcome, just credit me!\r\nIf anyone has any suggestions to future color textures just mention it. I am also planning to make this a standalone when the CK comes out, giving it stats that contribute to a light armored/stealth/thief/archer gameplay style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS-----------------------------------------------------\r\nJust copy \\\"textures\\\" into the data folder in your Skyrim directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits: Inspiration for the blade part was from ababuobi.",
