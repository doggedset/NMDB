  "descriptionHtml": "DarkSiders 2  Death Abyssal Armor\n<br />\n<br />This mod adds The Abyssal armor from the game Darksiders 2 to the world of Skyrim.\n<br />Made from the scratched abyss of 3D Studio Max and Photoshop.\n<br />\n<br />The armor comes in all 4 parts, body, head, gauntlets, boots.Due to the look of the armor, and because my last mod covered light armor and cloth, I made it heavy armor.\n<br />\n<br />All parts are forgeable in any forge,and of course, upgradable, enchantable.\n<br />\n<br />There are an optional body and head (mask alone), forgeable in the same way, which let you forge the armor with the actual Skyrim body textures.Just forge the models marked with SB(Skyrim Body).\n<br />All races are supported.\n<br />\n<br />The Abyssal Head SB, is in fact a circlet with armor rating, so you can use it with any other  armor.\n<br />The Abyssal Head SB Beast is for Beast races (Argonians and Khajiits, Orcs can use the normal Head SB)\n<br />For the mask without rating , see my other mod, The Necromancer armor.\n<br />\n<br />The main mod requires you to have the Daedric smithing perk to forge the armor.The armor level is Daedric, I didn't want to make this too powerfull.\n<br />\n<br />There is an optional esp, which doesn't require the perk and let you get the armor whenever you want , providing you have the required items.Don't use both esp at the same time or you risk to have double items in the forge menu.\n<br />\n<br />Known issues:\n<br />\n<br />this mod do use a custom , heavily modified, body(the part which let you see skin, the torso, in fact, the vanilla malebody_1 ,reworked)\n<br />If you play using the armor SB( Skyrim body model), your weight slider must be set  to 1, or you'll get some ugly neck seams.\n<br />Just open the Showracemenu in the console, set your weight to 1, exit the menu to return to the game.\n<br />I wanted to use the actual Skyrim body model but, if the malebody_1 was more than correct,the malebody_0 was to small and skinny, which was forcing me to remodel all the armor and gloves, and to re-rig them.\n<br />It is also not adviced to wear any other gauntlets with any of the bodies, you'll get some poketrough.The boots and masks however, are fine.\n<br />Sorry for the inconvenience.\n<br />The model should display any texture replacer you could use in place of the vanilla ones.\n<br />\n<br />If you find anything weird, let me know, I'll try to fix it if I can.\n<br />\n<br />Update on 02/18/2018:\n<br />The armor is now available on Bethesda.net for Skyrim SE for XBox 1, you can find it here:\n<br />https://bethesda.net/en/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4053874 \n<br />thanks to Shocklizard.\n<br />\n<br />Credits:\n<br />\n<br />Bethesda for Skyrim, this fabulous game.\n<br />Vigil games and THQ, the creators of the Darksiders franchise.\n<br />People from around the net, kind enough to upload pictures of detailed models.\n<br />Shocklizard for the SSE XBox1 port.\n<br />And , of course, people from the Nexus.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Permissions:\n<br />\n<br />Please, do not upload this anywhere without my prior consent.\n<br />\n<br />Have fun,\n<br />\n<br />AthenaX",
