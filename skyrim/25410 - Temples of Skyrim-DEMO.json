  "descriptionHtml": "This is a demo of a mod that will adds Temples in Skyrim for all the gods that don\\'t have one.\r\nThe mod goal is to improve roleplaying for player who play a religious character.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mod currently include a Zenithar Temple way north of Winterhold with a few features:\r\n\r\n-Villagers and Priests that are praying at the temple.\r\n\r\n-Donation bowls that will give you the Gift of Charity buff, more money you give, longer is the buff.\r\n\r\n-Shrines of Zenithar.\r\n\r\n-Praying altar of Zenithar: This altar will give you Prayer of Zenithar which is the same as blessing of Zenithar but double the strength and length.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat would I like to include in the final version:\r\n\r\n-Blessings that won\\'t overwrite each other, if that is even possible.\r\n\r\n-Schedule for some vanilla npcs so they will come visit the temple.\r\n\r\n-Temples for the following gods: Akatosh,Arkay,Julianos and Stendaar.\r\n\r\n-Custom conversation for the priests and villager, maybe even a speech for one of the priest.\r\n\r\n-A small quest line maybe? Will have to find a good one.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n1-Extract the file to your skyrim folder.\r\n2-Enable TemplesofSkyrim in your launcher\r\n3-Play!\r\n\r\nUninstallation\r\n------------\r\n1-In your data folder, remove TemplesofSkyrim.esp and its bsa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\nlatest patch\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\n\r\n-The current location of the temple isn\\'t final, I might move it closer if too many people don\\'t like the location.\r\n\r\n-I changed a copy of the Mara temple so don\\'t be surprise if it looks a bit similar.",
