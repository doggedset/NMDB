  "summary": "Simple retexture for the Female Werewolf by Moutarde421, adding the nether bits.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple texture mod to round off the great work done by Moutarde421. It uses the base texture from that mod and adds some nether bits to the female, namely, a vagina and anus. I also used Farron122\\'s \\\"Werewolves-under the tail\\\" mod for the anus texture and placement. I highly recommend his mod in conjunction with Derrax Male Werewolves. All of these mods combined will hopefully lend a bit of visual realism to being a werewolf in Skyrim. Or at the very least, you can have a good laugh.\r\n\r\nMoutarde421\\'s Mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10989/?\r\nDerrax Male Werewolves: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4445/?\r\nWerewolves-under the tail by Farron122: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8126/?\r\n\r\nTo install: download with NMM (fastest way) and load AFTER loading Moutarde421\\'s Female Werewolf mod\r\n\r\nManual installation instructions are included in the download but just in case you misplace that here they are:\r\n\t1. Download the mod Female Werewolf by Moutarde421\r\n\t2. Install the Female Werewolf mod (via NMM preferrably)\r\n\t3. Navigate to your Skyrim installation folder (eg. C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim)\r\n\t4. Open Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\werewolf\r\n\t5. Rename \\\"FemaleWerewolfbody.dds\\\" to \\\"FemaleWerewolfbody_original.dds\\\" so that you can switch back if you like\r\n\t6. Extract the file \\\"FemaleWerewolfbody.dds\\\" from the Primal Matriarch archive to Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\werewolf\r\n\t7. Load Skyrim and enjoy",
