  "descriptionHtml": "Fun, powerful, and will send people flying. Meant to be used by aiming high and arcing the projectiles like mortars or artillery. No perks required and no magicka cost to use because it\\'s just for fun. Learned from a spell tome on the table in Lund\\'s Hut which is up the road from Rorikstead.

Learned from a spell tome on the table in Lund\\'s Hut which is up the road from Rorikstead. Also added the spell tomes to a chest next to Skyforge in Whiterun.\r\n\r\nAdded Winter\\'s Mortar for anyone who would rather freeze their targets solid instead of blowing them into space. The spell tome for it can be found on the table in the main room of the Frostflow Lighthouse. These spell tomes are also in the chest by Skyforge.\r\n\r\n*Note: The Mage\\'s version of the spells are found right beside the cheat versions*\r\n*Note: Idk if it happens to everyone but sometimes I get a odd effect where the targets go zigzagging through the air like butterflys*\r\n\r\nAdded a new version simply called the Mage\\'s Mortar. This is for those who wanted a more balanced version to be used in-game. It is also on the table in Lund\\'s Hut along with the first spell tome.\r\n\r\nCurrently it has:\r\nhigh power though not quite as high as the cheat version. \r\nLong casting time and a high magicka cost to try to balance it\\'s power.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThanks to Kennaay for his amusing video that he posted displaying this mod : )\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBVq9ld3x68\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDownload from Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=11444\r\nCurrently 4 out of 5 stars with 139 ratings and 2463 downloads.",
