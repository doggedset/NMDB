INFORMATION ON THE MOD           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   This mod adds a follower who is a giant.  (Sorry, he is too big to go into dungeons with you.)\r\n\r\n\t   You can find the giant on the road west of Whiterun south-east of the Sleeping Tree giant camp. \r\n\t   \t   \r\n\t   The giant accepts the \\\"Join Me\\\", \\\"Wait\\\", \\\"Follow\\\", \\\"Share\\\", and \\\"Dismiss\\\" commands.\r\n\r\n\t   He uses original voiced dialog.  (He is a giant of few words.  Sort of the strong silent type.)\r\n\r\n\t   When you go inside a dungeon or building, your giant will wait outside for you and still be there\r\nwhen you get back.  He is too tall for going inside places like that.\r\n\r\n\t   He is a bit slow when walking, and won\\'t go indoors, but if you need a really powerful ally for \r\nan outdoor battle, then this might be a good companion for you. \r\n************************************************************************\r\n2. Installation                           \r\n************************************************************************\r\n           Extract (decompress) the .esp, Scripts, and Sound folders to your Skyrim directory.  \r\n(It will be something like *Installation directory*\\\\Skyrim\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data)\r\nMark the box next to Giant Companion.esp in your mod manager.\r\n \r\n           Alternately, extract files someplace else.  Then move the .esp files, scripts, and sounds \r\nto Skyrim\\\\Data.  Mark the box next to the plugin in your mod manager.\r\n************************************************************************\r\n3. Version History    \r\n************************************************************************\r\nV 1.0    2/26/12   Initial release.   \r\n************************************************************************\r\n4. Conflicts, Known Issues, and Troubleshooting\r\n************************************************************************\r\n\t   This mod is a bit silly.\r\n\r\n\t   This mod is expected to conflict with many other mods that edit giants.  Because of mesh and\r\ntexture problems that I do not understand, I had to edit the vanilla Skyrim giant race instead of using\r\nmy own new race.  So this mod will directly conflict with other mods that edit the original giant race.\r\n\t   \r\n\t   The game becomes too easy when you use too many followers. (Especially really powerful ones.)\r\n\r\n\t   On several occasions during testing, there was so much lag that the dialog options with the \r\ngiant would not work.  They started working again when there was less lag.  \r\n\r\n\t   On two occasions, the giant\\'s club did not render and he was carrying around an invisible \r\nclub.  I never edited the club, so this sounds like a vanilla Skyrim glitch to me.\r\n\r\n\t   I had to speed up the giant and slow down the mammoths in their stats menus.  So now the \r\ngiant\\'s walking animation does not always look right.  He sometimes sort of glides along if he is moving\r\nespecially fast.\r\n\r\n\t   You should not take your giant and his mammoths to town.  The mammoths tend to get in fights.\r\n\r\n\t   For some reason, when you fast travel, the mammoths arrive right where you do, and the giant \r\narrives some distance away and you might not see him at first.\r\n\t\r\n\t   If you locate a bug, contact David Brasher on TES Nexus so that the situation can be\r\nexamined and can hopefully be fixed. \r\n************************************************************************\r\n5.
