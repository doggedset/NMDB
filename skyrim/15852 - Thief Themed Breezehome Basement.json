  "summary": "Adds a realistic basement to Breezehome with a thief theme. The basement adds an enchantment table and various storage items and weapon and armor displays.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mods adds a basement under Breezehome with a thief theme without taking away from game balance. The basement can only be reached after you have purchased the Alchemy Lab. After doing so, you will find a key on the table along with a note. The note will explain what is going on and the key will unlock the trapdoor that is found while the Jarl\\'s men are installing your new lab. You use the trapdoor to access the basement. The basement contains:\r\n\r\n- enchantment table\r\n- mannequin\r\n- 6 weapon plaques\r\n- 2 weapon racks\r\n- 2 dagger display cases\r\n- 2 storage chests\r\n- safe\r\n- noble chest\r\n- bookshelf for 13 books\r\n- strong box\r\n- 2 barrels and sacks for storage\r\n- other random clutter for decoration including target dummies\r\n\r\nand a hidden room. All this was added to bring Breezehome on par with other playerhomes. This paticular theme was for the thief based classes such as archers, rogues, assassins, etc.\r\n\r\nBe sure to check out my website and subscribe to me on YouTube for more!\r\n\r\nWebsite - [url=http://www.demorus.com]www.demorus.com[/url]\r\nYouTube - [url=http://www.youtube.com/user/demothekeysmasher]DemoTheKeySmasher[/url]\r\nTwitter - [url=http://www.twitter.com/demotks]DemoTKS[/url]\r\n\r\n[youtube]5zb4zM3Fk1s[/youtube]",
