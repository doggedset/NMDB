  "descriptionHtml": "Ever since I bought Skyrim it has been driving me crazy that all the Dragons pretty much look the same apart from a few color differences. \r\n\r\nBlood Dragon - Where did he get his name? Maybe it\\'s because The Blood Dragon is notorious for purposefully bloodying himself with his victims? Or maybe he\\'s just a messy eater? I can\\'t really say for sure but the Blood Dragon definitely deserved to live up to his name, hence this new texture.\r\n\r\nI re-skinned most of the dragon (aside from his hard scales) with a real snake skin texture, I also added lots of glorious blood to the blood dragon in all the right places, killing talons, wings, mouth and teeth.\r\n\r\n***I also posted a \\\"Blood Only\\\" file which only applies the extra blood textures to the original Blood Dragon skin.\r\n\r\n*More to come* - I am trying to modify the textures of all of the dragons to give them a very distinct look in the game, ie Bloody Blood Dragon, Crystal Frost Dragon, Stone Ancient Dragon, ect.\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod ever so let me know what you think.",
