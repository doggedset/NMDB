  "summary": "Adds small changes to the village of Riverwood, such as trees, a smelter, crates, and lanterns without being too overbearing. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Description:\r<br />\r<br />   This mod most predominantly adds lanterns to the gates of Riverwood, as well as on the bridges, roadways leading to, and in front of some buildings. It also adds some new vegetation around town, without being too over the top. Shipping crates and small immersion objects such as beehives, bird&#39;s nests, and a storage shack are also added to the game to give the town a more natural feel. \r<br />\r<br />   This mod is probably not compatible with anything that alters the area around Riverwood. \r<br />\r<br />Installation: Due to my creation kit&#39;s love of crashing every 45 minutes or so, this mod has several .esp files. The easiest way to install it would be to just run it through NMM like a normal mod, if however, you are a masochist and like to manually install your mods, just add the .esps to the Skyrim &#34;data&#34; folder like you normally would and check them off in your data files entry. \r<br />\r<br />   This is my first [i][b]real[/b][/i] mod and all constructive criticism is not only welcome, but encouraged. \r<br />\r<br />Future plans: The goal of this series is to give the villages of Skyrim a more natural feel, without sacrificing the original look or becoming overbearing. \r<br />\r<br />- Ivarstead\r<br />- Shor&#39;s Stone\r<br />- Rorikstead\r<br />- Dragon Bridge\r<br />- Karthwasten \r<br />- Kynesgrove",
