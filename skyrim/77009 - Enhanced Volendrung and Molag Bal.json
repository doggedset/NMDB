  "descriptionHtml": "Before I made this mod, I have been using otherartifact enhancing mod by other which I enjoyed very much.\r<br />\r<br />As I failed to findsome suitable mod for those two artifacts, Volendrung and Molag\r<br />Bal,(some are quite too powerful to me)\r<br />I decided to mademy own modification and here it is.\r<br /> \r<br /> For Molag Bal,\r<br /> The enhancement cost is reduced from 84 to 60which allows 50 uses (origanl: 35)\r<br /> Bleeding damage effect is added to it, thedamage increases with your level\r<br /> \r<br /> For level lower than 16 (1-15), the bleedingdamage is 3 per second for a duration of 5 seconds\r<br /> For level between 15 to 31 (16-30) , thebleeding damage is 5 per second for a duration of 5 seconds\r<br /> For level greater than 30 (31 and above) ,the bleeding damage is 8 per second for a duration of 5 seconds\r<br /> \r<br /> the effect for the stamina magika damage andsoul trap effect remains unchanged. (25 damage to stamina and magika and 3\r<br />second soul trap)\r<br /> \r<br /> For Volendrung,\r<br /> The enhancement cost is reduced from 129 to100 which allows 30 uses (origanl: 23)\r<br /> \r<br /> A new effect is added to the hammer, when [b]player is wielding Volendrung[/b] and performing [b]a side power attack[/b], (power attack with left right button)\r<br /> the enemy will be thrown for a great distance(the effect is same as the strongest version of unrelenting force)\r<br /> \r<br /> the effect for the staminaabsorption  remains unchanged. (50 stamina absorption)\r<br /> \r<br /> For the Volendrung, the unrelenting force effectmight be enabled by the other user when player is using a\r<br />duplicate Volendrung from console and player is performing [b]a [/b]side power attack.\r<br /> \r<br /> \r<br /> Last but not least,\r<br /> I have edited the soul siphon perk in theenchanting perk tree, there will be a second level of soul siphon which\r<br />allows you to trap 15% of the soul.\r<br /> (restriction is that the soul is white.....notrecharging in killing people)\r<br /> \r<br /> I think this can make the perk moreuseful....I used the editted Molag Bal with the level 2 soul siphon fight\r<br />30 Falmer Nightprowler and the weapon remains charged throughout the fight.\r<br /> So I assume this would be fine.\r<br /> \r<br /> The editted Volendrung is really fun andmight be even too powerful I think.....",
