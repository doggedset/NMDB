  "descriptionHtml": "[center]Hidden Safe Storage\r<br />=================================================================================================================================\r<br />DESCRIPTION\r<br />\r<br />Not exactly lore-friendly, it adds a few stashes through out Skyrim and beyond (dawnguard dlc and dragonborn dlc locations).\r<br />The thing is, its one container.\r<br />You open any hidden stash and put stuff into it, you can pick it back up from any other stash on any different location.\r<br />Its a conviniance thing.\r<br />Now heres the catch, you got to find them. &gt;:D Lets hope you have a good eye for changes.\r<br />Placed at least one in each hold, and some holds have them outside as well.\r<br />Theres one in Riverwood ofcourse. The start point.\r<br />Just to clear things up, its not hidden, its just clutter items that seem hidden from general thought.\r<br />Heres some so you get the idea, right at Riverwood trader and one in Whiterun entrance by the blacksmith.\r<br />There are two more in whiterun.\r<br />If its a chest, youll know via a first time open message on each hidden stashes.\r<br />If its a clutter, you will notice its activatable and it usually read hidden stash, hollowed out etc\r<br />and its gonna inform you that you found a new stash.\r<br />\r<br />Since its not lore friendly to pick up stuff from any location, might as well work for it.\r<br />(Wish i could erase my memory to join the fun. xD)\r<br />\r<br />IMPORTANT\r<br />May conflict with other mods that modify world space. Adding or rearranging clutter etc.\r<br />You can avoid that and have more flexibility if this mod doesnt suit your needs but the functionality does\r<br />with this mod&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Craftable Cloud Storage mod\r<br />\r<br />VulcanTourist brought this to my attention.

Added only Riverwood and Whiterun stashes. Usually, thats my main route in game.\r<br />Riverwood - whtierun - Whiterun - Riverwood. I got tired of the running and fast traveling.\r<br />So i made this mod so i can stash my loot and use what and when needed for smithing in Whitrun or selling when im in Riverwood etc.\r<br />\r<br />I thought, why dont i share this. Someone might need it, or find it useful.\r<br />But not everyone is playing like me, so i redone the whole mod and added stashes in all major holds and a few (imo) places of interest.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy&#33; ;)\r<br />=================================================================================================================================\r<br />CREDITS\r<br />Original Author: theimmersion\r<br />Other Contributors: Creation kit for not crashing&#33; xD\r<br />=================================================================================================================================[/center]",
