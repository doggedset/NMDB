  "descriptionHtml": "Replaced the dragonborn comes song from the bard in the winking skeever ( lisette ) in solitude with an awesome cover of it ( video in the video section )\r\nShe doesn\\'t really sing yet or play the lute but i can\\'t do anything more untill the creation kit is out.\r\n\r\nAlso, i don\\'t know why this mod was removed maybe because the mods thought i did not have permission for the song, just to let everyone know. I HAVE PERMISSION TO USE THAT SONG!\r\n\r\nNow, enjoy it!",
