  "descriptionHtml": "Update: I lied, it didnt take me long to get around to making a Fort Dawnguard mod: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22263/\r\n\r\nShould work fine with this mod, though there may be a bit of clipping. \r\n\r\nBasically I just wanted to move my stuff into Fort Dawnguard in the event someone does a nice overhaul of the two bases, or I get bored enough to make my own. So all this does is throw in a player owned norespawn chest just inside Volkihar Keep and Fort Dawnguard for loot dumping. I dont really even consider this a \\\"mod\\\", just a personal tweak I thought others might want but are too lazy to spend 5mins in the CK like my brother is lol.\r\n\r\nObviously this requires Dawnguard to be active.",
