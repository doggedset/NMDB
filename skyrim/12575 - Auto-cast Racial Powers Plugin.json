  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b][size=5] Auto-Cast Racial Powers Version 3[/size][/b]\r\nPlease endorse!\r\n[b][size=3][color=#FF0000]Build Changes[/color][/size] [/b]\r\nThis build fixes multiple issues introduced with the latest patches (and Dawnguard). It also makes some slight balance changes in light of feedback provided. These changes will be noted in brackets below.\r\n[b][size=3][color=#FF0000]Known Bugs:[/color][/size] [/b]\r\nWhen loading a save of a character you are currently playing on, the powers break. (This will mostly occur when you die in game). In this circumstance, all you need to do is return to the main menu and re-load  the game. \r\nIt is an annoying bug, however it appears to be a fault with the creation kit itself, and as of yet, I have found no workaround.\r\n \r\n[b][size=3][color=#FF0000]What Does it Do?[/color][/size] [/b]\r\nThis mod will Re-vamp the racial powers to bring them back into your game play experience. \r\n\r\n1. All racial powers now auto-cast in situations where your character needs them.\r\n2. Additionally, these new Auto-cast racial powers will activate for NPCâ€™s, both enemy and friendly, making fights much more interesting and adding a new element to prioritizing targets in larger fights!\r\n3. All Racial powers have had their cool down periods reduced to 3 in game hours.\r\n\r\n[b] [size=3][color=#FF0000]Powers in Detail: [/color][/size] [/b][/center]\r\n[b]Altmer:[/b] Highborn power will now have a 40% (Down from 60%) chance to activate on each spell cast when Magicka reaches 20% (down from 40%) or below.\r\n[b]Argonian: [/b] Histskin power will now have a 40% chance to activate when hit by an aggressor when Health reaches 50% below.\r\n[b]Bosmer: [/b] Command Animal will now have a 25% (up from 10%) chance to activate when hit by a Beast.\r\n[b]Breton: [/b] Dragonskin will now have a 10% (Down from 25%) chance to activate when hit by an enemy spell.\r\n[b]Dunmer: [/b] Ancesters Wrath will now have a 10% chance to activate when hit by an aggressor when Health reaches 60% or below.\r\n[b]Imperial: [/b] Voice of the Emperor will now have a 10% chance to activate when hit by an NPC.\r\n[b]Kajiit: [/b] Nighteye is now a toggled ability. This change also applies to Werewolf and Vampire equivalents.\r\n[b]Nord: [/b] Battle Cry will now have a 10% chance to activate when hit by an aggressor when Health reaches 40% (Down from 70%) or below.\r\n[b]Orc: [/b] Berserker Rage will now have a 10% (Down from 25%) chance to activate when hit by an aggressor when Health reaches 50% (Down from 60%) or below. \r\n[b]Redguard: [/b] Adrenaline Rush will now have a 25% chance to activate when hit by an aggressor when Stamina reaches 25% or below and Health is at 80% or below.\r\n\r\n[center]\r\n[b][size=3][color=#FF0000]NPC Re-works: [/color][/size] [/b]\r\nMost of the racial powers worked fine for both the player and the NPC, however a few needed to be changed so that they worked better with NPC characters. [/center]\r\n\r\n[b]Bosmer: [/b] The NPC version of this ability uses the Animal Charm spell used by Spriggans.\r\n[b]Imperial: [/b] The NPC version of this ability will cast Oakflesh.\r\n[b]Nord: [/b]The NPC version of this ability will cast a Frostcloak.\r\n[b]Orc: [/b] The NPC version of this ability will just be a Damage increase.\r\n[b]Other: [/b] Redguard, High elf and Argonian abilities needed some slight adjustment to work and may be a little weaker/stronger than the originals.\r\n[center]\r\n[b][size=3][color=#FF0000]Useful Links: [/color][/size] [/b]\r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=14768]Steam Workshop[/url]\r\nNote: I no longer support the Steam Workshop.\r\n[url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1357390-release100-auto-cast-racial-powers]Bethesda Forum post[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12575]Skyrim Nexus: English[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14370]Skyrim Nexus: Italian[/url]\r\nNote: The Italian version is currently version 2.\r\n[b]Want to see your language here?
