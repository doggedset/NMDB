  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][color=red][b]Pahmar Khajiit Follower - Ra&#39;Khari[/b][/color][/heading]\r<br />\r<br />Ra&#39;Khari is a [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Khajiit#Pahmar] Pahmar[/url], one of the sixteen subraces of Khajiit. Little lore exists on them, so I decided to interpret them as just what the wiki says &#34;The Pahmar is similar in appearance and size to a tiger.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />This poor Khajiit was the guard for a new caravan heading to Falkreath. After resting, however, it seems his companions have disappeared. After waiting for a long time, he discovered their bodies and a dead sabrecat nearby, with a battleaxe embedded in it&#39;s head. So, now he waits, still guarding the caravan.\r<br />\r<br />Ra&#39;Khari speaks in the standard Khajiit tone, fights like a sabrecat and has a unique texture (see credits for details) and will behave as a normal human follower. He sometimes gets stuck in doorways and narrow passages, but giving him a little nudge will make him move. He is located at a new location named Pahmar Camp located in Falkreath Hold - See screenshots for map marker. You can fast travel there as soon as you load the mod and it also functions as a small player home with a few crafting stations, safe storage and a few beds.\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]=====[b]Installation[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Just download and drop the ESP into your data folder and the meshes and textures into their appropriate folders.\r<br />Or just use the NMM. \r<br />To uninstall, just remove the file. \r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]====[b]Compatibility[/b]====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[i]Compatible:[/i]\r<br />Anything that doesn&#39;t change cells -21, -12; -12, -20; -11, -20 and -11, -20.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Incompatible:[/i]\r<br />Anything that does change cells -21, -12; -12, -20; -11, -20 and -11, -20.\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]=====[b]Permissions and Credits[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />This mod is not to be uploaded anywhere but the Skyrim Nexus.
