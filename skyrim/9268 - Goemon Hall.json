  "descriptionHtml": "Goemon was a legendary Japanese thief, who stole from the rich and gave to the poor. He is the inspiration for my Skyrim character \\'Basil\\' and the motivation behind this house mod. Heavily geared around a thief, this dark lair is just south of Riften and is full of Nightingale accents.\r\n\r\nThis is my first ever mod for any game. Over the next few weeks I\\'ll be adding lots more polish, clutter, external details and possibly a secret area or two. If I can find time I\\'ll also add a quest (as skills develop) geared around gaining access to the house. It\\'s kitted out with blacksmith, alchemy and enchanting equipment, as well as plenty of storage.\r\n\r\nHappy to recieve any hints, tips and suggestions. Thank you for your interest!",
