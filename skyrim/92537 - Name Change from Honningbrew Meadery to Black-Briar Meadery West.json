  "summary": "A simple mod that changes Honningbrew Meadery's name to Black-Briar Meadery West, along with the Boilery next door, and the basement.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I remember playing Skyrim on the 360 one day, and really enjoyed playing the mission 'Dampened Spirits.' Seeing Maven and Mallus' little plan all unfold right before your eyes was a great sight to see. But when you ask Mallus what he's going to do with the meadery, he tells you, \"I'm gonna start converting it over to the Black-Briar Meadery West...\"\n<br />\n<br />Well, Mallus, you also forgot to email Todd Howard about the name change for the location, because even though the sign for the building changed, the actual name for the map marker and cells, didn't. But I understand, you're a busy man. That's why I did your job for you. You did most of the work by replacing all the Honningbrew bottles with Black-Briar bottles anyway.\n<br />\n<br />So, basically, I used Creation Kit to change the name for Honningbrew to Black-Briar Meadery West on the map, and also changed the name for the cell to the same thing. I also changed the names for the basement, and the boilery.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Map Marker Before:[/b] Honningbrew Meadery\n<br />[b]Map Marker After:[/b] Black-Briar Meadery West\n<br />\n<br />[b]Honningbrew Meadery Before:[/b] Honningbrew Meadery\n<br />[b]Honningbrew Meadery After:[/b] Black-Briar Meadery West\n<br />\n<br />[b]Honningbrew Boilery Before:[/b] Honningbrew Boilery\n<br />[b]Honningbrew Boilery After:[/b] Black-Briar Meadery West Boilery\n<br />\n<br />[b]Honningbrew Basement Before:[/b] Honningbrew Basement\n<br />[b]Honningbrew Basement After:[/b] Black-Briar Meadery West Basement\n<br />\n<br />Keep in mind that this mod is not programmed to automatically change the names AFTER you complete Dampened Spirits. If you install this mod at any point in the game, it will change the name for the location no matter what the circumstances are. AKA, whether you've completed the mission, or not.\n<br />\n<br />To Install:\n<br />Use Nexus Mod Manager or manually install by cutting-and-pasting into Skyrim's Data folder.\n<br />\n<br />Please let me know of any issues so I can attempt to work on them. Thank you for your interest in this mod.",
