AWAITING in the middle of NOWHERE??\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n     While playing the game i was annoyed by those two facts:\r\n\r\none: no matter how well hidden i am (in a cave), the game knows where i am. And send to me a messenger, a courier, a bandit, etc.\r\n\r\ntwo: no matter how far and remote the place where i am is, there will be someone awaiting for me to meet. A killer, a bandit, a vampire, etc.\r\n\r\n     The whole concept of wilderness were thus ruined off. Well, not anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n     With this mod, the wilderness is wilderness. Nobody knows that you are there. Roads are darn empty too, like it should be. Only wild animals/ creatures/ etc here.\r\nDue to dragons and creatures dangers, nobody ventures to far from the cities/villages now.\r\n\r\n     In the wild, the remaining persons that can be found are those that have a specific place to stay.\r\n\r\n- fishers/hunters that have a specific place.\r\n- bandits/necromancers/ members of civil war that have a specific place.\r\n- khajiit caravans, but only near the cities, arriving or departing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     You can be found by people (couriers) only when approaching the settlements. \r\n\r\n     When you are in to the wild, you will not found and not be found by humans, except those above.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical details:\r\n\r\nOpened Construction Kit\r\nDeleted so named \"quests\" under \"wilderness encounters\" name. (There are no quests, there are scripted events).\r\nSaved the file.\r\n\r\nThe complete list with what events is deleted is listed at http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:World_Interactions#Random_Events\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
