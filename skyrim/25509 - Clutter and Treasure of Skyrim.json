  "summary": "If you\\'re like me, you enjoy breaking into houses and shops, & steal everything in sight. Unfortunately, that everything is fairly limited.\r\nNot with this mod, however.\r\nYou\\'ll find the practical to be stolen - spools of thread, a washbasin, childrens toys, and the impractical, purely for vanity items such as action figurines & dragon claws that ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Back to working on this. Had some computer issues, so had to reinstall game & files. Anyway, in the version l\\'m working on now, I\\'ve made some experimental changes. Arcadia\\'s Cauldron has a table with failed & spoiled potions, & a few other things like that. Her loft has also had a small layout change. Finetuning the lighting in belethor\\'s loft. \r\n\r\nItems added\r\n\r\nTreasures:\r\nEbony Raven Statue\r\nDraugr Figurine\r\nBrown Bear Figurine\r\nMorrowind Relics (not the artifacts.) (values may change, as well as placement)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-Treasures:\r\nBuilding blocks (With letters, dova characters, or numbers.)\r\nCrystal Balls\r\nHour Glasses\r\nCouple ingredients & soul gems (where appropriate)\r\nTops (The spinning toy)\r\nTeddy Bears\r\nPlanters (hopefully with appropriate weights & values. will adjust as necessary.)\r\nBits of charcoal, paper for people to write all these books and notes\r\nFood & Drink \r\nWash Basins, Soap & Scrub Brushes\r\nWatering Cans\r\nSpools of Thread\r\nExtra bow & arrows \r\nWeapon Racks with weapons (low quality/level.)\r\nBasket of dead bugs - can you find who\\'s been catching dragonflies, & his stash of bird eggs?\r\n\r\n\r\nStatic Items added:\r\nRocking Horse\r\nPaintings \r\n\\\"Drawings\\\"?\r\nMead Barrels\r\nHarvestable static planters\r\nCouple tables\r\nClothes Lines\r\nFirewood Piles\r\nMisc Furniture\r\nA bee hive - have you ever noticed all those holes in the walls etc??  Look for it. :p\r\nSpinning Wheel, barrel of wool and a stool\r\nCob Webs with bugs\r\nShield Racks (empty.)\r\n\r\nVanilla Layout Changes (rare)\r\nSevario Pelagia\\'s house - added a ladder to the loft. think of it like extra storage he mostly ignores. Navmesh shouldn\\'t give any trouble, haven\\'t tested it w/ followers yet but it should be fine. \r\n\r\nSince I finally have something to show, I\\'m going to go ahead and list the resources I used, and where I got them. \r\n\r\n",
