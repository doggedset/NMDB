  "descriptionHtml": "\r<br />[u][b]Sorry but i am no longer supporting this mod, so feel free to use it how you wish.[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />New player home up date.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Lyra is away from home and has left it in your hands, so look after it and have fun.\r<br />\r<br />This is a revisit to my Home To Let 2, a no loaddoor home near Ivarstead. Its a small but well equipped abode now with stable and horse. I have also added a bridge over the river for better access.\r<br />\r<br />I use this in my own game and I made it to fit my needs. it is not a home to get lost in, it is for somone who wants to craft, store and play the game not the house.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />As a no load door home it will rain inside, and the mannequins do not always behave.\r<br />\r<br />Note: if you are updating from Home To Let 2 I have made some changes to the inside storage so move your items to the Dwemer chest on the right as you come in the door.",
