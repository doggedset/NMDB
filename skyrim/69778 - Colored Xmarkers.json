Enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Title says it all, Colored Xmarkers&#33; For you who have insane requirments for order and want visual confirmation when you are placing those sweet xmarkers down for scripts and quests.\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s that simple, I use them to track the Xmarkers I&#39;ve put down for quests and scripts, usually you track them through the quests alias list, since you add them there and give them reference names, but sometimes you just want some extra visual confirmation that &#34;this&#34; is the xmarker you placed for &#34;myquest/myscript&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />Made when having fun with vertex colors in 3ds Max, just made a switch from Maya, this is just something i made up while looking at vertex colors on different models and i thought maybe someone else out there who want fancy colors on their Xmarker, well here you are.\r<br />\r<br />The colors of the Xmarkers are in the picture, if you are somehow unable to look at a picture here are the colors that I added to them. here they are:\r<br />\r<br />Black, Blue, Cyan, Green, Orange, Pink, White, Yellow and RAAAAIIIINBOOOOW&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The markers will not be visible ingame, so this is something for the users of the creation kit, unless you want me to make you shields that looks like Xmarkers.\r<br />\r<br />There you go, cheerio.",
