  "descriptionHtml": "Adds environment maps to the crown and stones of Barenziah and changes the textures a bit to make them look a little more appealing, I didn&#39;t really like the way the vanilla textures looked on the stones and the crown and didn&#39;t notice anything during a web search, so I tweaked them.. and made them shiny and metallic.. the way they should be.\r<br />\r<br />This isn&#39;t meant to make the gems and crown look &#34;amazing&#34; with super duper HD textures or anything like that, it&#39;s just supposed to be a little nicer than what&#39;s already there. The pictures don&#39;t really show the differences that well, they are better seen in game.\r<br />\r<br />Credit goes to Bethesda as all textures and meshes used are from the game it&#39;s self.",
