  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3]Oblivion had it, why doesn&#39;t Skyrim?  Looks like it was started and not finished as a feature. This mod adds undressing (and re-dressing) to all bed furniture in Skyrim. You can decide if you want Bedrolls to be included as a &#34;bed&#34; for this as an option (would be immersion breaking to stumble into an outdoors camp with sleeping bandits in inclement weather, but the choice is yours).  Also comes in DLC included and Non-DLC options.  There are other sleep mods out there, but they use a heavy handed approach to this IMO, with quests, scripts, magic effects, location monitoring, etc.  The most effective approach is the most efficient approach to me, so here it is.  An incredibly simple and [i][u]fast[/u][/i] script embedded directly in the bed, no quests, magic effect or any of that other stuff that can and does cause issues.\r<br />\r<br />What you see when the npc undresses is up to YOU and your installed mods, NOT this mod.  The mod has been flagged as nudity/adult to keep the prudes from complaining.\r<br />\r<br />Credits: Original scripting language was posted in the Nexus forums by jvilleseche as a possible solution and completely ignored for some reason. I compiled the code, tested, confirmed it works extremely well, and then added the script to all the beds in the game.\r<br />\r<br />Installation: I highly recommend NMM for installation and uninstallation.\r<br />\r<br />Issues, conflicts:\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][size=3]May conflict with other mods that edit the beds for whatever reason (Size Does Matter comes to mind, it edits the RaceTo Scale).[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Only works on default game bed IDs.  Custom beds used in add-on house mods won&#39;t get the effect. Custom houses that use default game bed types will work fine.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]For reasons I can&#39;t comprehend, a few NPCs won&#39;t respond to the unequipall command (Ulfberth War-Bear is one).  This is probably due to not having a &#34;NakedSkin/Hands/Feet&#34; default effect like normal npcs, the armor may be embedded.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]The script works by looking for the sleep state, so the npc will crawl into bed and then undress immediately when their head hits the pillow.  When their head comes off the pillow, they immediately re-equip.  If you are looking for a mod that lets you watch an undressing/dressing animation, this isn&#39;t it.[/size]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />Permissions:  I didn&#39;t write the code, just compiled it and embedded into the game assets.  Can be used for any purpose.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size]",
