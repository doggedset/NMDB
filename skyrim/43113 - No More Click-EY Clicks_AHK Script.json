  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#f8e200][size=4][b]NEW[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#3ce702][size=2][b]Clikey Clicks Script v1.1[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nUnlike the original v1.0, this new [u]v1.1[/u] of the script is customizable - as some users asked for - where you can specify all the details.  This gives you more flexibility and makes the script more useful, even outside the game!  It should also provide better compatibility for users with remapped keys, and even those with non-English keyboards.\r\n\r\n(1) [color=#02d7e7][b]Which Hotkey you want to use.[/b][/color]\r\nPease do NOT use complex keys with modifiers (Ctrl or Shift or Alt). For example: \\\"X\\\" or \\\"PgUp\\\" are ok, but \\\"Ctrl-X\\\" or \\\"Shift-Alt-PgUp\\\" are not ok.\r\n\r\n(2) [color=#02d7e7][b]How many loops you want the script to do.[/b][/color]\r\nThis determines how many loops the script will do with 1 press of the Hotkey.\r\nDon\\'t worry though, you can press the Hotkey again to do as many loops as you want.\r\n\r\n(3) [color=#02d7e7][b]Which key presses you want to spam.[/b][/color]\r\nFor example: \\\"E and Y\\\", or \\\"F and 5\\\", or \\\"` and ]\\\", etc.\r\nIn fact, you can specify 2 keys in each box, for a total of 4. For example: \\\"R5\\\" and \\\"=8\\\", or any combination you want from the allowed characters.\r\nThis can also be useful if you want to spam keys outside the game!!\r\n\r\n(4) [color=#02d7e7][b]How much delay or pause you want between each key press.[/b][/color]\r\nThe lower the delay (which is in milli-seconds), the faster the keys will press.\r\nThe best speed depends on how fast your game and PC are, and possibly how much frame rate or FPS you have.\r\nIf you have a slow PC or your FPS is low, you might miss some key presses.\r\nBut it does not matter at all, even if you put 1 or 0 ms delay and skip some key presses as a result, because you can just spam keys as much as you want :D\r\n[line]\r\n- Btw, I have disabled the Game detection for now, so you can load the script at any time, before or after you start Skyrim.\r\n\r\n- Also, I included a small popup msgbox to tell you when your input was successfully saved. I can disable that later on though.\r\n[line]\r\nThe zipped/archive file has both the [b]Compiled[/b] and [b]Uncompiled[/b] versions in it. So use whichever you prefer.\r\nThe original version 1.0 is still available of course.\r\n\r\nWaiting for your feedback!\r\nRez\r\n[line]\r\n[line]\r\n[color=#ff8c00][size=4][b]DESCRIPTION[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThis AHK script (the original v1.0) is a small and simple utility that relieves you of having to spend hours spamming \\\"E\\\" and/or \\\"Y\\\" on your keyboard when you are doing stuff in bulk, like mass smithing, forging, smelting, stripping leather, buying, or even wood-chopping (if you remove the animation from the wood-chopping script or use a no-anim mod). It is especially useful if you have mods that let you breakdown everything, like clutter, misc items and others.\r\n\r\nI wrote this just for myself for fun and thought I would share, just in case others might find it useful.\r\n[b]It has saved me a lot of time, pain and mouse clicks :P.[/b]\r\n\r\nThe script can be used for anything that requires spamming the keys \\\"E\\\" (to activate) and/or \\\"Y\\\" (for yes confirmation). You can use it even if you only need to spam one of the keys, like \\\"E\\\" by itself or \\\"Y\\\" (the other key presses will simply do nothing).\r\n[line]\r\n\r\n[color=#ff8c00][size=4][b]WHAT IT DOES[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nOnce you activate it, the script will simply spam the keys \\\"E\\\" and \\\"Y\\\" for you. That\\'s all.\r\nIt does not get installed and does not interfere with anything really.\r\nYou can turn it on and off whenever you like or delete it without any issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#2EFE2E][size=4][u][b]Important[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nYou need to keep your game MAXIMIZED while the script is running. This is how most AHK scripts work, since they are not injected into the game itself. AHK scripts normally simulate key presses regardless of the application. So, if you minimize Skyrim while the script is running, the script will be pressing \\\"E\\\" and \\\"Y\\\" on your desktop lol or in/on whatever application you put in the front.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have included a function in the script to detect if the game is running, so the script will not activate if the game is not on. But just take note of this please.\r\n[line]\r\n\r\n[color=#ff8c00][size=4][b]INSTALLATION[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nThe scripts comes in 2 versions. Choose the one you prefer:\r\n\r\n- The [b]uncompiled[/b] version, which is the .AHK file. You need to install the main [url=http://www.autohotkey.com/]AutoHotKey[/url] program to run this version.\r\nIt is also the source code, so you can open it and look at it in any text editor.\r\n\r\n- The [b]compiled[/b] version, which is the .EXE file. This can run by itself and does not need any other program.\r\n\r\n[u]NOTE[/u]: It does not really matter where you save or place the file, since you can start it from any folder.\r\n[line]\r\n\r\n[color=#ff8c00][size=4][b]UNINSTALLATION[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nTo uninstall, just delete the .AHK or .EXE file you downloaded.\r\n[line]\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF00][size=4][b]Loading, Activation & Deactivation[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF00](1)[/color] To load the script: start Skyrim, alt-tab out and double-click the .AHK  or  .EXE file.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF00](2)[/color] A new [H] icon will appear in your system tray (the side bar on the lower right of your Windows desktop, where the system clock is).\r\nA green icon means the script is loaded and is ready to be started.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF00](3)[/color] If Skyrim is on, the script will take you into the game. If Skyrim is not on, it will display an error message.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF00](4)[/color] To [b]start[/b] and [b]stop[/b] the script: just press the [color=#00BFFF]END[/color] key on your keyboard (END/BREAK on my laptop), since it acts as a [u]toggle[/u].\r\nIn other words, press [color=#00BFFF]END[/color] to start, and press it again to stop.\r\n\r\n[color=#FFFF00](5)[/color] To completely [b]terminate[/b] the script: alt-tab out of Skyrim, right-click on the [H] icon and press [b]EXIT[/b]. The file and script will be terminated.\r\nIf you want to use it again, you will have to start from Step 1.\r\n[line]\r\n[line]\r\n[center][u][b]HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THE SCRIPT[/b][/u][/center]\r\n\r\n[u]What you need[/u]\r\n\r\nTo change key presses in the script for your own use, here are some instructions. AHK is very simple, so it should be quite easy. (If you happen to re-publish my script with changes, please give credit :))\r\n\r\n- You will first need the [b]uncompiled[/b] version, so that you can do your changes directly to the .AHK file.\r\n\r\n- You will also need to download and install the [url=http://www.autohotkey.com/]Autohotkey[/url] program itself, since the .AHK file needs it to run.\r\n\r\n- Right-click on the .AHK file and click EDIT and it should open in Windows Notepad, or drag and drop it in any text editor. Once you do your changes, save the file. Easy peasy!! :D\r\n\r\n- If you want to make an [b]uncompiled[/b] file, right-click on the new .AHK file and click COMPILE. It will create an .EXE file for you.\r\n[line]\r\n\r\n[u]What to change[/u]\r\n\r\nThere are 3 things that you may want to change in the script. Do not change anything else unless you know what you are doing :P\r\n\r\n- the toggle key (END) to start and stop the script.\r\n- the \\\"E\\\" key press.\r\n- the \\\"Y\\\" key press. \r\n[line]\r\n\r\n[u]Where to change[/u]\r\n\r\nHere is where you do the changes in the script:\r\n\r\n[Line 26]  [u][b]End[/b][/u]::   <-- this is your toggle key to start the script. You can change \\\"END\\\" to whatever key you want.\r\n[Line 35]  If GetKeyState(\\\"[u][b]End[/b][/u]\\\", \\\"P\\\")   <-- this is your toggle key to stop the script. You can change \\\"END\\\" to whatever key you want. It is better to use the same key for both the start and stop function, for simplicity.\r\n\r\n[Line 39]  Send [u][b]E[/b][/u]   <-- this is your \\\"E\\\" press. You can change \\\"E\\\" to whatever key you want.\r\n[Line 41]  Send [u][b]Y[/b][/u]   <-- this is your \\\"Y\\\" press. You can change \\\"Y\\\" to whatever key you want.\r\n[line]\r\n\r\n[u]Notes[/u]\r\n\r\nI think any key press can be emulated, even in non-English keyboards, as long as the proper code is known. Here are some links to help you get started: [url=http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm]AHK KeyList[/url]\r\n\r\nThere is also a small function I included in the script called \\\"KeyHistory\\\" which is commented out [Line 31]. You can uncomment it to try and find special keys when you press them. You may need to add [b]#InstallKeybdHook[/b] to the top of the script as well if it does not work at first: [url=http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/KeyHistory.htm]AHK KeyHistory[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope it is useful.\r\nRez\r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\n[size=3][b][u][color=#EBE00E]M[/color][color=#CDDD0C]y[/color][color=#B0DB0A] [/color][color=#92D808]M[/color][color=#75D607]o[/color][color=#58D305]d[/color][color=#3AD103]s[/color][color=#1DCE01]:[/color][/u][/b][/size]\r\n\r\n> [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/41587//?][color=#a05ced]REZ SORTING MOD[/color][/url]\r\n> [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/44737//?][color=#a05ced]Rez Modified Spells and Settings[/color][/url]\r\n> [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/43113//?][color=#a05ced]No More Click-EY Clicks_AHK Script[/color][/url]\r\n________________________________________",
