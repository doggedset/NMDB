  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4]Patch for Alternate Start - Live Another Live ([b]2.5.2a[/b]) in combination with Vampiric Thirst (2.61)[/size]\r<br />Version 0.1\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Description[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Combined, these modifications [b]may[/b] lead to a problem at the Maras Eye Pond as a vampire (ASLAL: &#34;Secluded Lair&#34;-Option). After choosing to spawn as a vampire in said lair you get attacked by the occupants, or at least some of you as I&#39;ve not found that much regarding this issue. Therefore I&#39;ve wrote a little Patch which puts every occupant into a newly created faction so they won&#39;t attack you. \r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Requirements[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />Since I&#39;m not adding but just fixing things up you don&#39;t need to install anything else for this to work, but I&#39;ll write it down nonetheless:\r<br />- SKSE\r<br />- Dawnguard\r<br />- Alternate Start - Live Another Life\r<br />- Vampiric Thirst \r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Install\r<br />\r<br />[/u][/b]If you use NMM, then simply add the Archive to your list and activate the mod. \r<br />If you don&#39;t use NMM, \r<br />   (1) copy the .esp-file into your [b]&#34;Skyrim/Data&#34;[/b] folder and \r<br />   (2) copy the file name into your plugins.txt and loadorder.txt located in &#34;%LOCALAPPDATA%&#92;Skyrim&#34; or activate it through your Skyrim Launcher.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Uninstall\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/u]Just remove the .esp-file. It doesn&#39;t alter anything in your savegame and therefore should be not causing any problems.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]TODO\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/u]Factions are not considered right now, e.g. random Vigilants of Stendarr in the cages could get friendly, not tested, though.\r<br />\r<br />If you happen to have an idea what needs to be fixed or if things don&#39;t seem to work anymore because of a new version of ASLAL or VT, let me \r<br />know&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Credits[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />.. go out to Arthmoor for his great mod Alternate Start and of course MsLeeches for her great Vampiric Thirst (I loved VtMB).
