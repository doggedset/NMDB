Cause why not.\r<br />\r<br />You can find it in the Dragonreach fireplace in front of Jarl Balgruuf in whiterun.Â \r<br />\r<br />DISCLAIMER: The weapon isn&#39;t called overpowered Daedric Sword or anything, during the time I name the sword Dark Souls cause I can&#39;t think of anything and was to lazy to change it. The file also call Dark SOuls. So don&#39;t bother the name that much. No, its not anything from the dark souls game.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION: This is really important: you need to download the file and place it in the Skyrim data folder",
