  "summary": "Changes the Pale Housecarl, Gregor, to a Dunmer Sorcerer named Ralamus and changes his equipment to accommodate his new skills.",
  "descriptionHtml": "For some reason I always get the feeling that Heljarchen Hall belongs more to Winterhold rather than Dawnstar. So it didn&#39;t bother me to alter the Housecarl from the Pale to a more College-going type: a Dunmer who excels at sorcery. The final entry in the Housecarl Requip Project, so expect a compilation soon.\r<br />\r<br />Details: changes Gregor&#39;s class to Combat Sorcerer, replaces his equipment with a full Adept of Destruction outfit and provides him with several spells. Also, if you choose the Dunmer version, it changes his name to Ralamus, but it doesn&#39;t change his voice, because doing this could cause serious bugs.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements: Hearthfire, nothing else.\r<br />\r<br />Bugs: The Grey Face Bug is likely to occur when activating this mod after first encountering the Housecarl. So either use this on a save file in which you haven&#39;t encountered the affected NPC, or hope a more experienced modder comes up with a solution.\r<br />\r<br />Installation: simply drag and drop the files into the Data folder and activate the .esp.\r<br />\r<br />Load Order: as low as possible, especially if you have any other mods running that alter Gregor&#39;s appearance.\r<br />\r<br />P.S., feel free to take screenshots of Gregor whilst running this mod and send them to me, I might add the pictures to the file. Also, if you want any other followers altered, send me a message, I enjoy doing this.\r<br />\r<br />Permissions: If you want to have the file changed, just send me a message and what you want changed, and I&#39;ll probably give permission or do it myself.
