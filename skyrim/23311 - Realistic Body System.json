  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/23311-1-1347526573.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[color=#13ccfd][heading]Realistic Body System[/color][/heading]\r\n\r\n[color=#13ccfd]Description[/color]\r\n\r\n* Body variation of females\r\n- 30 different female bodytypes (not only sexy ones, but realisitc ones), generated with bodyslide on a random basis.\r\n- For those 30 bodypes fitting meshes of clothes and armor, in vanilla or skimpy look are generated and attached to the npcs\r\n- these thousands of meshes are weightsilder compatible so 30 * 100= 3,000 different body types are possible.\r\n\r\n* Body variaton of males\r\n- 6 different Skeleton.nif files for males which let them look more or less bulky\r\n\r\n* Body Texture Deployment System\r\n- normal, specular, color and detailmaps are added and combined to &--#62; 500 different female bodytextures and 150 male textures\r\n- normal maps are used to show more or less muscles. A Formular calcualtes how strong a NPC is and attaches the muscle normal map to it. So weak NPC are looking weak and strong NPCs look strong now.\r\n- the other maps are attaches on a random basis.\r\n\r\n* Weight and height of NPCs\r\n- Weight is calculated by a formular that checks which clothes a npc wear before the RBS changes and adjust the weight to fit their job. Beggars are now thinner and Barkeepers fatter..\r\n- Height is changed on a random basis\r\n\r\n* Configuration other options by checkboxes (yes/no)\r\n- use skimpy clothes (killerkeo\\'s meshes, not too skimpy)\r\n- use clothes Pool for NPCs (all clothes are added to leveled lists which will be attached to NPCs)\r\n- correct NPCs neck seams and grey head bug (under development) working particularly now\r\n- use hair variation (If there is a hair mod in you loadorder, RBS will deploy those hair meshes to npcs)\r\n- change weight by job (desribed above)\r\n- use texture variation (desribed above)\r\n- change males (done by skeleton files)\r\n\r\n*player character is not touched by RBS\r\n\r\nAll of the above checkboxes can be toggled by users in SkyProc patcher menu\r\n\r\n[color=#13ccfd]Requirements[/color] \r\n\r\nJava Runtime 1.7\r\n\r\n[color=#13ccfd]Installation[/color] \r\n\r\nDownload the Realistic Body System file that has to be unpacked to data folder. If you want best result, be sure that the generated esp by SkyProc patcher is loaded last.\r\n\r\n[color=#13ccfd]FAQ[/color] \r\n\r\n[color=#0b7c9a]What are the differences of the 30 bodytypes?[/color]\r\n\r\nThe shape is calculated on a random basis, in a future version it would be possible to genereate predefined bodies. But i think the random generated bodies for now look realisic.\r\n\r\n[color=#0b7c9a]I am a boobs lover, aren´t those titties too small?[/color]\r\n\r\nAs i created the formula to generate the bodytypes i had in mind to achieve a realistic bodyshape on an average. The randomness can produce also big boobs, but it is relativly rare.\r\nAnother pack will be released for your boob lovers in future.\r\n\r\n[color=#0b7c9a]Can this mod be enhanced by others?[/color]\r\n\r\nYes! Everybody and their dog can change or even create new NPCs with support for Realistic Body System and release it.  Realistic Body System is meant to do this. \r\n\r\n[color=#0b7c9a]Is this compatible with everything?[/color]\r\n\r\nI think it is, but other mods that overwrites the clothes or race of an NPC will made the mod not work for this special NPC.\r\n\r\n[color=#0b7c9a]Will it replace the body of my player character?[/color]\r\n\r\nNo it does not. RBS has its own meshes and textures, nothing is overwritten!\r\n\r\n[color=#0b7c9a]How to install and uninstall?[/color]\r\n\r\nUnpack everything to the data folder.\r\n\r\n[color=#0b7c9a]What´s next with this mod?[/color]\r\n\r\nHmm don´t know at the moment. But i think i will get an idea.\r\n\r\n[color=#0b7c9a]Thanks to[/color]\r\n\r\nCaliente - for CBBE, Bodyslide and vanilla outfit package\r\nstuffed_bunny for bodysliders and outfit packages and of course for cb++\r\nwithout those two, RBS were not possible!\r\n\r\nLeviatian1753 for SkyProc! Fantatic Tool!!!\r\n",
