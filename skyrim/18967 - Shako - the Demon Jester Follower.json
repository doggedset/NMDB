Shako the Demon Jester approaches you, calling you a noob.  When you try to kill him, he disappears, or runs away.  Sometimes he creates a clone of himself to fight along side him, trolling you all the way.  You can also have him follow you and fight along your side, all the while he sings of your noobiness.\r\n\r\nHe disappears when low on HP, and he casts hallucination, where you see ...double... look behind you...\r\n\r\nGet your Shako today.  He\\'s better then Cicero.",
