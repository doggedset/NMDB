  "summary": "Adds a house south of riverwood (Faendal\\'s house is closest) that houses a slaver and six of his hireable slaves.",
  "descriptionHtml": "You find a house south of faendal\\'s house and a strange note on the door that leads you to assume the identity of a slaver. Follow the instructions and you will have the choice of six hireable slaves with an extra opinion for marriage, the slaves I intentionally left unclothed to give the player a better customization and because how many slaves have you seen in glass armor. I also added the slaver to sell some gear as well during the standard trading hours of skyrim, when he is patrolling around in the slave pen hallway.\r\n\r\nFixed issues: Fixed a bug with the animation of the door.\r\n                    Fixed Vanidis and Asha\\'s issue with not following the player\r\n\r\nRate or slate it, any comments suggestions advice or questions would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nVersion 2\r\n\r\nAdd in a new Tavern near a Giants camp nearby whiterun, don\\'t frett there is a map marker. inside is a typical tavern with an unusual cellar trapdoor below you will find another two slaves to use as companions, Added in a few notes and books to give a little more character and a ransacked caravan near snapleg cave which ties into the khajiits story. \r\n\r\nVersion 2.5\r\n\r\nCompletely blown out of proportion with the theme name Mysterious house but nevertheless it\\'s expanded\r\n\r\nNew\r\nIn total 14 slaves\r\nIn total 6 locations of interests\r\nseveral books and notes to give the Sior Marke faction a history and storyline\r\na dungeon with a cool little suprise at the end.\r\nKnown Issues\r\n\r\nStill head/body mismatch I will resolve soon enough\r\nMay have invisible buildings which will be resolved along side the head/body issue\r\n\r\nRate or slate it any advice, comments or questions please don\\'t be shy.",
