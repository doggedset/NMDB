  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][color=red][b]Improved Derkeethus - The Argonian Ranger[/b][/color][/heading]\r<br />\r<br />Dear Bethesda - You give us one Argonian badass and he&#39;s just green? What the hell? Don&#39;t worry, I fixed him for ya ;)\r<br />\r<br />Ah, Derkeethus. My favourite follower, companion and pack mule. It&#39;s a shame he&#39;s just plain green. So, I took him and gave him some color. I tried to make his face look dirty, as he is a miner, but also gave him some splashes of colour here and there. I kept his original skin tone, horns and eye color, for that&#39;s what defined Derkeethus and what the other revamps didn&#39;t seem to appreciate. A scar  now also lines his cheek. \r<br />\r<br />I also threw him in Fur Armor, since it&#39;s logical he wouldn&#39;t go exploring without proper gear, no? His combat skills are also a little better, but not overpowered. He now levels up with you, has a few sneak, archery and dual-wield perks, and won&#39;t affect your sneak meter. He is also now essential.\r<br />\r<br />Why did I do this when there are at least seven other revamp mods? 1) None were to my taste and either changed him to much, or left him too plain. This makes him feel just right. And 2) Cause I could.\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]=====[b]Installation[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Download and drop the file into your data folder.
