  "descriptionHtml": "This mod changes the three new dragon priest masks added by the Dragonborn expansion, both graphics-wise and gameplay-wise, in order to better fit mage classes and others who like using them. I got the idea from [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=105836753]this mod[/url], which is pretty damn useful, and I decided to take what that author did and do it with these masks, taking a step further.\r\n\r\n[u][b]Note: I did NOT change how Miraak\\'s mask at all, I only changed the three lesser masks. I will probably Miraak\\'s mask in a different mod, and then only gameplay-wise[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n[u][b]Gameplay changes:[/b][/u]\r\n--Removes the armor rating from each mask, allowing mage classes to benefit from the Mage Armor perk, considering that these masks were definitely geared mainly towards magic users.\r\n--The masks now take up the face slot (unnamed slot 44 in the CK), allowing for free use of both circlets and helmets.\r\n\r\n[u][b]Graphical changes:[/b][/u]\r\n--The masks no longer have a hood, leaving only the mask itself.\r\n--The masks have been reskinned, to reduce clipping. I used the dragon priest masks from vanilla Skyrim to achieve this. The graphics in the item menu have also been changed to reflect this.\r\n   --Azhidal now uses Volsung\\'s graphics.\r\n   --Dukaan now uses Morokei\\'s graphics.\r\n   --Zahkriisos now uses Nahkriin\\'s graphics.\r\n\r\nInstallation is easy, just extract the esp and bsa into your Skyrim data folder, or use NMM to install it.",
