  "descriptionHtml": "*31/08/2014 UPDATE: Added 1.1.0 which does NOT change color, but enhances the leathery look. Not noticeable at simple glance, but released only as a colour fix. Still working on making it have that leathery texture we all want to see.*\r<br />\r<br />Not much to add, the [color=#BF9000]Thieves Guild armour[/color] has always seemed like just a set of leathery rags to me (no offense, I should add). The Thieves Guild Leaders one was ok, but it didn&#39;t feel [color=#000000]Black [color=#f4f4f4]enough. [/color][/color]And then, there&#39;s the v2 textures on some of them Thieves like I think Etienne of Vipir. I decided to live it up, and give those textures a small re-touch. I thought it&#39;d be ok to do so, and I liked what came out. Also, sharpened the image to give it a leathery texture (like I did the [color=#980000]Dark Brotherhood one[color=#f4f4f4]). \r<br />\r<br />Only glitch: It seems[/color][/color] as though the v2 armor, instead of just being a lighter shade of white, and lighter brown on the straps, decides to skip the nice texture it took me a moment to clean up, and go full white. Like a model with no textures, but instead of being that weird light blue shade, it goes full white. If someone could please fix that?",
