  "summary": "An Enhanced Whiterun for the Open Cities by Arthmoor. \r<br />\r<br />",
  "descriptionHtml": "Info\r<br />\r<br />I think that the vanilla cities are very empty and there are many mods to fix that. But all of those mods that I have tested there were errors such as trees floating 2 meters above the ground, trees in the middle of the road blocking some stairs and trees partly inside houses when using Open Cities.\r<br />\r<br />With Arthmoor&#39;s Open Cities mod you get to have the all Cities as a part of the main world so that you don&#39;t need to have a loading screen when entering and exiting  cities. But if you have Open Cities then you can&#39;t have the other mods that add stuff to the vanilla cities, so I made this mod because I wanted Skyrim&#39;s Cities to be more beautiful and look less empty. \r<br />\r<br />So, this mod adds trees, plants, bushes and stuff to the &#34;Open Cities&#34; to make them look better. (According to me, if you don&#39;t like how I make it, then you&#39;re welcome to make your own mod or find another one)\r<br />\r<br />Currently the only affected city is Whiterun, but I&#39;m planning on modifying the rest of the cities as well .\r<br />\r<br />[color=#cc0000]Currently working on a new and updated version with new placement of trees, and all large trees tagged as FULL-LOD so they don&#39;t &#34;pop out&#34; when you&#39;re too away from the city. Plus some extra detail work.\r<br />\r<br />[/color][size=2]And yes, I know that Aspen trees don&#39;t [u]really[/u] fit in at the City of Whiterun due there being pine trees all around, but I prefer how aspen trees look, and let&#39;s just say that [b]Jarl Balgruuf [/b]also likes them and got his gardeners to plant them.... [b]Problem Solved&#33;[/b][/size][b]\r<br />[/b]\r<br />[size=3]Installing & Uninstalling[/size]\r<br />\r<br />You need to have Open Cities, SKSE, SkyUI and the Skyrim Patch 1.9.32.0.8 or greater.\r<br />\r<br />Install Open Cities as a normal mod and then install this mod. \r<br />This mod needs to be after Open Cities in you Load order\r<br />\r<br />To uninstall it just remove the mod from you Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=3]Performance[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[/b]This mod will probably affect performance (FPS) and maybe also your load times, since there are more objects to load and render, and there are going to be many more shadows and more textures to load. Depending on your current performance, mods and hardware this mod could have no visible effect on your performance, or it could lower it by quite a bit. \r<br />\r<br />For example if you are using many high resolution textures and are already using close to all of your VRAM and the extra textures for the trees make you use all of it. Or due to there being many more shadows (and Skyrim not being the most optimised game)\r<br />If you however loose quite a bit of performance, but you want to have trees in the Open Cites, then I&#39;d recommend lowering your shadow resolution or shadow distance before uninstalling the mod, as they can have a major effect on your performance.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Compatibility\r<br />\r<br />[/b]It should be compatible with all mods except for those that add stuff to Capital Cities.\r<br />\r<br />If you find any errors (Floating trees and weird stuff) or if you find any incompatible mods (that are not adding stuff to vanilla cities) then please tell me.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][b]Enjoy[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][size=3]Recommended Mods [/size][/u]\r<br />\r<br />Skyrim HD - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/607/?\r<br />Skyrim Flora Overhaul - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/141/?\r<br />SMIM - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8655/?\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Compatibility[/b] [/size]\r<br />\r<br />- Open Cities (Of course)\r<br />- Skyrim Flora Overhaul\r<br />- Immersive Laundry\r<br />\r<br />Should be compatible with [u]ALL[/u][b] [/b]texture mods, seeing how they don&#39;t add any new things to the world.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Incompatibility\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/size]Mods that change the size of trees, (It can cause clipping or just make it look odd / different than intended)\r<br />Other mods that change the vanilla cities or Open Cities. (JK&#39;s Skyrim, Beautiful Cities)\r<br />\r<br />It will however be incompatible with your game if you [b]DON&#39;T[/b] have Open Cities, or if you have other mods that add items & trees to cities.\r<br /> And most likely also be slightly or totally incompatible with mods that completely change the game, such as turning the world into a winter place (Many of them add extra things to the world to make it less empty.",
