  "descriptionHtml": "I decided to upload a female preset i made and use, she is an imperial and she comes with the basic hair and basic eyes, you only need skse, racemenu to use her, you can give her what ever hair you require, i use her alot and in the pictures i used the hair from appachiiskyhiar and the skin texture is from the epicelf race mod, you can use anyskin and she will look good i just prefer the epicelf skin, my choice really, i made her look sad because her character had a hard life, more for the roleplayers than anything, anyway you can just download her and use nmm or mo to intal no need for manual instalation as i already did the file path needed to instal so its plug and play, i hope you like it if you do endorse if you dont like it then no harm, i know that not everyone likes mods what people make that is just part of life.",
