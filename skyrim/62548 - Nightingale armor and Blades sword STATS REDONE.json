  "descriptionHtml": "This is just a simple replacer that replaces/upgrades Nightingale armor stats and Blades sword stats to the more appropriate level.\r<br />\r<br />Nightingale armor changes:\r<br /> -Improved armor rating for the whole set ( 17 extra armor rating if wearing the whole set )\r<br />  \r<br /> -Improved enchantments:\r<br /> Gloves ( replaced fortify lockpicking with fortify archery )\r<br /> Boots ( added fortify stamina )\r<br /> Armor ( replaced fortify stamina with fortify health, replaced frost resistance with magic resistance )\r<br /> Hood ( added fortify speechcraft )\r<br />\r<br />I always thought the Nightingale armor&#39;s enchantments were a little wrong for my taste so i fixed that.\r<br />\r<br />All enchantments were also made a little stronger.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Blades sword changes:\r<br /> -Base Damage increased from 11 to 16\r<br /> -Base Value increased from 300 to 600\r<br /> -Name changed from Blades sword to Akaviri katana ( original name from TES IV: Oblivion )\r<br />\r<br />I always thought that Blades sword had a little low damage and value for a katana sword so I fixed that. \r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />Simply put the downloaded NightingaleREDONE.esp file in the Data folder in your TESV: Skyrim directory and check the box\r<br /> in Skyrim Data files in the launcher.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />UNINSTALLATION:\r<br />Simply delete the NightingaleREDONE.esp file from the Data folder in your TESV: Skyrim directory.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I hope you enjoy this little project of mine and let me know what you think about it. :) ",
