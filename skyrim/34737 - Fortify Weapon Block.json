  "descriptionHtml": "Frankly I\\'m amazed this mod hadn\\'t been done already O,o\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]What\\'s it do?[/b]\r\nThis mod makes one simple change - Fortify Block enchantments now apply to ALL forms of blocking; one-handed, two-handed and shields (Even most unarmed and dual wielding blocking with mods that support it) as opposed to vanilla Skyrim where it only applied to shield blocking.\r\n\r\nThis applies to existing, standard block enchantments and for player enchanted items alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Is it compatible with...[/b]\r\nYes, it\\'s just one simple change - enchanting rebalance mods may interfere with it; in which case you can place it at the bottom of the load order perfectly safely. Everything else it\\'ll work fine with and can be freely removed at any time without causing any harm to your save file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n...and that\\'s all there is to it.",
