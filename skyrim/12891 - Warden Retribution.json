The set grants the player a new Seal combat Mechanic.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can find the weapon and armor set outside Whiterun, in a Chest near the Khajiit Camp.\r\nUpon equipping the armor, a new spell ][Seal of Light][ will be added to the player\\'s Spell Book.\r\nThe Spell will be removed when unequipping the armor.\r\n\r\nThis Seal of Light is a Voice equipped Lesser Power spell and has the following effects:\r\n\r\n -Casting the spell will recover 50% mana and 50% stamina at the cost of 20% Health\r\n -Casting the spell while SPRINTING will trigger the \\'Blazing Speed\\' Effect:\r\n        -for the next 3 seconds the player knocks back enemies in his path, setting them on fire\r\n        -during the effect, the player leaves a trail of fire in his path\r\n        -when the effect is over, the player teleports back to his initial location (where he triggered the effect)\r\n -Casting the spell while BLOCKING will trigger the \\'Seal of Protection\\' Effect:\r\n        -for the next 10 seconds the player takes 50% less damage from all sources\r\n        - the player\\'s movement speed is reduced to 50%\r\n        - the player regenerates health 10x faster\r\n        - attacks made with Light\\'s Reach can disarm opponents\r\n        -during the effect, the Player can consume the Seal of Protection (by pressing \\\"Z\\\") in order to spawn a Guardian Circle at his Location.\r\n\r\n -Casting the Spell while POWER ATTACKING will trigger the \\'Seal of Judgement\\' Effect:\r\n        -for the next 10 seconds, the player has increased attack speed and stamina regeneration\r\n        -the player takes 20% more damage from all sources\r\n        -the player does 20% more damage\r\n        - attacks made with Light\\'s Reach can Drain Life and Knock Back enemies, while setting them on fire.\r\n        -during the effect, the Player can consume the Seal of Judgement (by pressing \\\"Z\\\") in order to engulf his enemies in flames.\r\n\r\n ->>Triggering Any seal Effects will cost the player 20% HEALTH! (you can kill yourself)\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThe custom armor set is modeled for the female version at the moment, leaving the male version to be added in further releases.\r\nThe armor is compatible to any body mods, although I used the UNP body as a reference.\r\n\r\nGive me your feedback.
