  "descriptionHtml": "Harry Potter Wands\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nUpdate notice for Harry Potter Wands version 1.1:\r\n--------------\r\nThis mod now REQUIRES the Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE), version 1.5.9 (latest as of this) or higher.  I haven\\'t tested without it.  It might silently fail, it might crash, I don\\'t know.  But it won\\'t function correctly without it.\r\n(On the plus side, SKSE works with Windows 8 now so it shouldn\\'t be a problem to anyone who can google SKSE and read the installation instructions!  Huzzah.)\r\nAlso, the previous wand objects were removed, and can\\'t be found in the drawers anymore.  You\\'ll have to craft or spawn them again if you want them.  See below.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n------------\r\n\r\nAdds wands from the Harry Potter movies to the game. So far there are four (more to come), 3 of which are craftable (one is left for a quest but can be spawned). These use the default staff animations.\r\n\r\nThe wands included so far are:\r\n\r\nElder Wood Wand (Dumbledore\\'s wand) (Uncraftable, saved for a quest, but can be spawned with the console)\r\nChestnut Wand (Wormtail\\'s wand)\r\nHolly Wand (Harry\\'s wand)\r\nYew Wand (Tom Riddle\\'s wand)\r\n\r\nAll craftable wands need one firewood, a filled grand soul gem and some other object (dependant on the wand) to craft.  At a Forge, it\\'s under the \\\"Wood\\\" (I know this doesn\\'t make sense for a forge, but just go with it for now.) category.\r\n\r\nThere\\'s now a menu to change the current spell of the wand.  To activate it, draw the wand and it should trigger.  If not (this has happened a few times to me) sheath it, wait a second or so, and draw again. (edit for 1.1.1: added a choice between this and a lesser power)\r\nOnly some of the magic schools (as of now, Destruction, Illusion and Alteration) have anything in them.  Next update (provided it isn\\'t to fix bugs...) will add more.\r\n\r\nThe destruction spell \\\"Avada Kedavra\\\", the Killing Curse, instantly kills the target.  However, it can\\'t kill essential NPC\\'s, and will \\\"backfire\\\" onto the player when used.  So rather than spam it until the charge runs out, think about choosing your target carefully!\r\n\r\nIssues/conflicts:\r\n-----------------\r\nNone that I know of right now!  This new update is completely different (aside from a few spells and most of the meshes) so hopefully any old bugs are fixed.\r\nThere is a house added in Windhelm, which can\\'t be entered yet.  This will be a wand shop in a future version, but I\\'m leaving it in assuming if there\\'s a conflict I\\'ll find out before the update to add the interior.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n----------\r\n1.1.1 - script update:\r\n- Now gives a choice of whether the player will change wand spells with the old unsheathing action or the new way (adds a lesser power)\r\n- Fixed the yew wand not providing a bonus\r\n\r\n1.1 - First update:\r\n    - Now REQUIRES SKSE for the scripts\r\n\t- Has new spells and one new wand (yew)\r\n\t- Wands have magic \\\"buff\\\" effects added to the player when they\\'re wielded\r\n\t- Improved some of the textures\r\n\t- Added a house/shop in Windhelm (will get an interior once I think it doesn\\'t break anything)\r\n\t- Added a spell selection to the wands so they can all cast the same spells (still no way to cast the players\\' spells yet.)\r\n\r\n1.0 - Initial release\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n--------\r\n\r\nMod, meshes, textures and scripts by Spyduck.\r\nAll of this was inspired by and based on the Harry Potter movies, so far all the wands\\' appearances are from those.
