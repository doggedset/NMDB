  "descriptionHtml": "---- Version 2 RELEASED - 18.12.2011\r\n---- Version 1 RELEASED - 17.12.2011\r\n\r\nThis mod is the first using new loading engine similar to SKSE. It is a launcher which via scripts and code creates HUD. Mods were impressed and got approval for it. See the screenshots.\r\nAlso, This is Normal version (size). Bigger one comming up. Also, this is just a beginning of the HUD mod. Lot more to be done.\r\n\r\n// MOD INFO\r\n\r\n- Creates HUD with Health, Magicka and Stamina bars always present.\r\n- You can always see the charges on your weapons. Both left and right. Bow is always right.\r\nAlso, you can see when weapon is recharghing.\r\n- HUD is smart enough to see every change you make. It will never bug out.\r\n- Favorites Menu expanded and added some colouring to help see what you have selected\r\n- You can see number of arrows constantly on the HUD.\r\n- More to come.\r\n\r\n// MAIN INFO ABOUT LAUNCHER\r\n\r\nFluxMOD Launcher is application that can be used in simillar fashion as Script Dragon or SKSE. \r\nFluxMOD Launcher is used to launch a specific FluxMOD. Later, there will be options to launch multiple mods and not only FluxMOD ones. Currently FluxMOD Launcher supports both Script Dragon and SKSE. In fact, you can use .ASI scripts WITHOUT SKSE and Flux Launcher will\r\nrun them just the same as you ran them with SKSE. It is 100% compatible with .ASI scripts for Skyrim and all mods you have in Data folder.\r\n\r\n// ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\nFluxMOD Launcher is used to launch MODs I create and cannot be launched in normal fashion because they require more serious modding and coding.\r\nAlso, FluxMOD OVERRIDES everything. Which means almost ZERO CONFLICT! It works with everything currently users are using: Script Dragon, SKSE, various mods, etc. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind you NEVER have to delete your mods. FluxMOD Launcher overrides them during it\\'s execution. After the Launcher is shut down, everything returns to normal.\r\n\r\nExample: Let\\'s say you have a UI mod you are using now. And now you saw FluxHUD and decided to give it a try.\r\nYOU DON\\'T HAVE TO DELETE YOUR OLD MOD! While using FluxMOD Launcher you will just temporary override your old mod. Cool no?\r\n\r\nSo with that in mind, FluxMOD Launcher can NEVER harm your Skyrim installation or your MOD setup. It is just a temporary change while certain FluxMOD is active. Try it! \r\n\r\nAlso, every FluxMOD has it\\'s own Launcher so it is easy to select MOD you want to use. \r\n\r\n// PLANS FOR FUTURE\r\n\r\n- Make FluxMOD MultiLauncher\r\n- Ability to launch SKSE or SD plugins\r\n- Much more...\r\n\r\n// INSTALLATION AND USAGE\r\n\r\n1. Copy FluxMOD Launcher-FluxHUD.Normal.exe to Skyrim game dir. \r\nExample: C:\\\\Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\\r\n2. Run the program and click \\\"Start\\\" to start Skyrim Launcher like usual but \r\nwith FluxMOD active in background.\r\n\r\n// ABOUT\r\n\r\nProgram made by argie (CODEFLUX).\r\nCODEFLUX RELEASES ARE ALWAYS MALWARE FREE!\r\n\r\n// CONTACT\r\n\r\nE-Mail: argie.rce@gmail.com\r\n\r\n// FILE CHECK\r\n\r\nCRC32: A94B5A34\r\nMD5: C9778ACAF18DAB2769F6416DDA481C0E\r\nSHA-1: 09109E3492D176A07220BDFDE5546D91C6D8DCEA",
