  "modName": "Unarmed sneak attacks and requirement changes",
  "summary": "Changes the default unarmed sneak attack value to 3x and makes unarmed valid attack types for backstab and assassin\\'s blade and shrouded gloves. Also removes backstab requirement from deadly aim and removes deadly aim requirement from assassin\\'s blade.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Really simple mod.\r\nIt changes base sneak attack multiplier of unarmed attacks to 3.0x from 2.0x. Unarmed attacks also benefit from backstab and assassin\\'s blade perks as well as shrouded gloves. Because why not? Not to mention we have stealth kill cams for unarmed attacks.\r\n\r\nRemoves backstab perk requirement from deadly aim and deadly aim requirement from assassin\\'s blade. Assassin\\'s blade still requires backstab. Well, if you are going to use bows, you wouldn\\'t really benefit from backstab perk and if you are going to use daggers, you don\\'t really benefit from bows. You can still unlock them but it is a choice.\r\n\r\n Compatibility:\r\nIt is not compatible with mods that alter backstab, deadly aim and assassin\\'s blade perks, it should be compatible with mods that add shrouded glove effect to other items.",
