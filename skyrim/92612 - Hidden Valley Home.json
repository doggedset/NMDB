  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=5][b][/b][/size][/center][center][font=Trebuchet MS][size=5][b]Hidden Valley Home[/b][/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />Ever wanted to live in a tower? Ever wanted to live in a tower located in a small valley? Ever wanted to grow hair so long that you could throw it out of the tower? Well then I've got good news for you, because this mod does two of those things! Above Falkreath you can find a entrance that leads you into a valley. The person who lived there is long gone, so feel free to take it for yourself.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][b]Includes:[/b][/font]\n<br />- Several storage containers \n<br />- Smithing area + Leather rack\n<br />- Various alchemy plants \n<br />- Alchemy station\n<br />- Cooking station\n<br />\n<br />[b]Update:\n<br />[/b]1.1 - Grindstone, Workbench, Smelter, Woodchopping block, minor fixes\n<br />[b][/b](Soonish, I hope) 1.2 - Hearthfire addons.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Notes:\n<br />[/b]There is also a locked box, with a hidden key. Hope you have swimwear :)\n<br />Also, it's bin a while since I've made a mod. And only ever made one or two house mods. So if you happen to come across a bug, please share it with me so I can fix it. Things should work fine though. Tested by a friend of mine, and myself of course. Screenshots are made with Vivid Weathers active. \n<br />This mod is made clean by TES5Edit.\n<br />Final note, thanks for downloading if you did, and hope you enjoy it!\n<br />\n<br />[b]Credits:[/b]\n<br />[b]Oaristys[/b] for Modder's Resource Pack\"\n<br />[b]Artisanix[/b] for Paintings and Frames\n<br />[b]Blary[/b] for Openbook Resources and Ingredients Wall Art Resource\n<br />[b]LorSakyamuni[/b] for The Witcher 3 Mega Resource Pack[/center]",
