  "descriptionHtml": "It always bothered me that you couldn\\'t build up your Restoration skills in Skyrim like you could in Oblivion.  Then you could just cast healing spells on yourself even with a full health bar and build it up.  In Skyrim, you can\\'t do that with a full health bar.  So I made this, the Ring of Restoration Training.  Fairly simple, you equip the ring and it slowly but steadily drains your health.  When it is low enough, just cast the basic Healing spell (the one you have from the beginning) and watch your Restoration level up as you heal yourself.  Once your health bar is full, stop healing and repeat.  And when you\\'re done, just unequip the ring.  Now you don\\'t have to constantly get into fights and get hurt to exercise your Restoration skills.  Now you can just hurt yourself.  (Kind of masochistic, isn\\'t it?)\r\n\r\nYou\\'ll find the ring at Breezehome.  It will be in the Alchemy Laboratory.  I\\'ll make a craftable one later.\r\n\r\nWARNING!!!  Do NOT leave the ring on without healing yourself for too long!  It WILL kill you!\r\n\r\nLatest version: Now craftable. Instead of finding the ring at Breezehome, you find a journal that tells you what you need to make the ring.",
