  "descriptionHtml": "I appologise for my gramar :p\r\n\r\nthis mod, although still a large work in progress will add a realistic population to all of skyrim\\'s hold and villages, these NPCs are tied into the appropriate crime faction and will interact with the environment and eventual with the player. \r\n\r\nCurrently all of the City capitals (with the exception of Markarth) have been populated with a more realistic population. this mod currently adds nobles wearing random clothes and equipment\r\n\r\n*** \r\n\r\nin future updates i will add a full repopulation of the holds along with the addition of many new features including randomised People and Clothing, Random Hireable Mercenarys with varied equipment and hopefully random hireing prices, travelers/merchants , mages and magic uses , Traveling scholars ( who teach skills ), thieves , traveling adventures/hunters/civilians , amateur dragon hunters , and other NPCs who will give simple but repeatable mini quests to provide more interactivity with the cities. \r\n\r\n***\r\nAs of now i cant do anything about the grey head problem, if anyone knows how to fix it please leave a comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
