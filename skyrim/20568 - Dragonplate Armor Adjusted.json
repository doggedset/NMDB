  "descriptionHtml": "Warning: my native language is not english.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]• Description\r\n===========[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nThis is a extremely simple mod that trade the attributes (armor, weight and value) of the dragonplate armor with the daedric armor.\r\n\r\nThere\\'s also a optional file that improves the dragonplate armor rating and value to make it better than the daedric armor.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]• Install\r\n=======[/b][/color]\r\nManual Install:\r\n------------------\r\n1. Choose on version of the mod.\r\n2. Extract this archive to any folder and then copy the contents to Skyrim\\'s Data folder.\r\n3.

Or enable it with the NMM.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]• Uninstall\r\n=========[/b][/color]\r\nManual Uninstall:\r\n---------------------\r\n1. Start SkyrimLauncher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esp file(s).\r\n2. Delete the files associated with the mod in the data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]• Known Bugs\r\n===========[/b][/color]\r\nNone so far, as I know... Please give me a feedback!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]• Long Story...\r\n============[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[i]\\\"Brynjolf, huh? Lemme guess. He plucked you off the street and dropped you into the thick of things without tellin\\' you which way it up. Am I right?\\\"[/i] - Delvin Mallory\r\n\r\nSo, pull up a seat, have a drink...\r\n\r\nThis mod was made to prevent reactions like [url=http://images.cheezburger.com/completestore/2011/11/19/4688641f-5a65-49aa-8e5e-22883fbbfd73.jpg]that[/url]. My first intention was to improve the dragonplate armor to make it better than the daedric, and I started to study the progressions of the value and armor of the craftable heavy armors.\r\n\r\nAs I was expecting, the armor follows a linear progression, and the value a exponential. There\\'s some interesting facts I found, like the fact that the steelplate armor have a higher armor rating than it was expected, but the value is lower. Perhaps to compensate the lack of a shield for this armor category. But, the iron armor was a bit more weird; the \\\"normal\\\" version is two steps behind the steel armor. The banded iron armor is where it should be, but there\\'s no banded iron Helmet, Gauntlets or Boots, so it stays behind. (There\\'s someone wanting to make this lacking itens?).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I showed my mod to a friend and he said \\\"they will found that a sort of cheating\\\". Well, following the progression should make the stats only 1 to 4 points higher then the daedric, depending of the part. But he was a kind right.\r\n\r\nBut then I realized one thing: the dragonplate armor is lighter than the daedric. How is that possible considering that the dragonplate armor is basically made of dragon bones, the heaviest armor ingredient available? Switch the attributes of this two armors should make a lot of sense! In fact, that makes more sense than the vanilla stats, IMO.\r\n\r\nI know this is a kind stupid, but I think such a simple thing was a good way to start... I used SkyEdit, so thanks to Dave and everyone who made that.",
