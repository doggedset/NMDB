  "descriptionHtml": "   [center]﻿[/center]﻿If you are like me and love mods such as Dwemer goggles and scouter,  Dwemer Certified and Dwemer Colosseum then you know the one thing that they all have in common.  All of these mods require Dwarven oil in some way and since there is only a limited amount of guaranteed  samples of oil  this can be very frustrating and annoying. \r<br />   ﻿The solution I came up with was to make Dwarven oil craftable at the cooking pot.  But, I did not want to make this extremely easy with two or three very easy ingredients.  So I chose 1 Crimson Nirnroot, 2 chaurus eggs and 2 wheat as the required ingredients. Each time you create oil at the cooking pot it gives you five samples.  This amount may change  if it is found to be overpowered after I play test with my next character or from user feedback.\r<br />   ﻿I felt that requiring Crimson Nirnroot was good to balance the mod since it can only be found in blackreach and in limited amounts until they respawn.  Chaurus eggs was chosen mostly because it is not a common ingredient and it can be found among dwemer ruins.  Also it is plausible that since the Dwemer lived underground and interacted with these creatures that they may have found a use for these eggs that other Man and Mer may still have not figured out.  The last ingredient  I chose was Wheat  to imitate modern alternative fuels that use real crops  like corn and I wanted to have at least one ingredient that was easy to find.  \r<br />   ﻿This is my first ever released mod to the NEXUS so if anything is wrong please let me know.  However, this is a very simple mod that I have tested without any problems. \r<br />\r<br />Recommended mods[list][*] Dwarven Colosseum by Korodic [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33385/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33385/[/url]﻿?\r<br />Dwemer Goggles and Scouter by volvaga0 [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13133/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13133/[/url]﻿?\r<br />Dwemer Certified by TheTalkieToaster  [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10442/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10442/[/url]﻿?[/*]\r<br />[/list]",
