  "descriptionHtml": "Replaces the vanilla textures for the Daedric Arrows. This texture has a red/black theme to it to match the armor and feel of daedric items more. Red accents have been added to the quiver and on the arrows. The main part of the quiver that was originally dark brown has been made darker. \r\n\r\nThis is my first mod so tell me if something is wrong in comments.\r\n\r\nWorks with mod manager.\r\n",
