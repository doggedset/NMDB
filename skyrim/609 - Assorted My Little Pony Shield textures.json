  "summary": "Ever wanted have a pony on a shield? Now you can! Download now! Ponies currently available are Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie. Pinkie Pie thusfar comes in two flavours that come bundled together.",
  "descriptionHtml": "If you like this mod, you should LOVE this one, done by browen: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1823\r\n\r\nThis mod also shows more promise than mine, done by Theomach:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6931\r\n\r\nEDIT: Well, there\\'s a sane Twilight Shield now, I\\'ll probably do Derpy next. Any suggestions on what city she should belong to would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nChoose any of the mane six individually (Or just have the Mane Six collection!) in the downloads section.\r\n\r\nFluttershy: The Whiterun shield, but with Fluttershy on it instead! Once installed as per the instructions included with the mod, one can obtain the shield simply by picking a lock on the correct display case located in Dragon\\'s Reach, just through the door to the Jarl\\'s quarters. This texture has now been improved with vibrant and dirt/faded textures included in your download.\r\n\r\nPinkie Pie: The solitude guards can now enjoy their favourite eccentric pony emblazoned upon their shield. Includes vibrant and dirt/faded versions. If you know an easy way to obtain this shield for one\\'s own character\\'s use, please do tell!\r\n\r\nRainbow Dash: The loyal guards of Ulfric Stormcloak can now have the most loyal pony displayed on their shield. The only way I know to obtain this shield for personal use is to kill on of the guards and take it from them. Not all the guards seem to carry it. But worry not! One guard that does seems to hang around all by their lonesome and can be taken out swiftly with the right tools. And is the hunt not half the fun?  \r\n\r\nRarity: Bringing fashion back to the run-down city of Riften, this pony can now be placed upon the shields of the Riften guards! Now you can behold her beautiful hair even when playing Skyrim! Just promise not to get her too dirty, she wouldn\\'t like that. To get this shield for yourself, either pick off a guard when no one is looking, or level up your pickpocket and try to take one from a guard without it equipped.\r\n\r\nApple Jack: Your Dawnstar guards can now have Apple Jack on their shields! The only reason being black goes with anything. Have fun with your new loyal shield!\r\n\r\nTwilight: I\\'ve uploaded a sane Twilight separately due to inexplicable popular demand. The download includes some free stuff to make up for my folly. Go, have fun and download the as of yet untested sane Twilight shield. Please report back with any problems you have with it. My full apology is in the README.txt file.  \r\n\r\nDerpy Hooves: Do you like muffins and postal services? Then you\\'ll LOVE this texture! Derpy can now serve to mislead people into thinking the guards of Markarth are really posties. Won\\'t that be fun? Comes with the usual \\\"dirt\\\" and \\\"vibrant\\\" variants. Have fun!\r\n\r\nFeel free to edit and re-upload, so long as credit is given where it is due. I\\'m not a terribly good artist, so please, do improve on it if you can. Have fun and enjoy this My Little Pony texture! This texture shall be updated in the near future\r\n\r\nMore My Little Pony ponies to come in the near future!\r\n\r\nIf you like ridiculous mods, check out the Rainbow Dragons mod of ToXiiCzz which can be found here: http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2120 \r\n\r\nYou will need 7zip to extract. 7zip is free and available at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html ",
