  "descriptionHtml": "Across the river from Riverwood, there\\'s a tower with a door, this door leads to the interior of the Blue Palace that was duplicated and had the NPC\\'s removed. I added a smithing area in the lower guard barracks and an alchemy table in the wizard\\'s room, and a vendor with a ton of gold in the throne room. \r\nThere\\'s also a nice armor set behind a locked door that would normally lead to the Pelagius Wing.\r\n\r\nSimply extract this into your /Data folder and enable it in the launcher OR download with the NMM and enable it there.\r\n\r\nAny questions, suggestions or requests?
