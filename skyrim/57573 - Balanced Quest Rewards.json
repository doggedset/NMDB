  "summary": "Reduces the amount of gold you get from NPC favour quests by ~2/3.",
  "descriptionHtml": "In the vanilla game, the amount of gold that you get for completing favour quests is absurd. You&#39;ll risk life and limb as a bounty hunter or renowned dragon slayer and the Jarl will reward you with 100 septims. Then you&#39;ll deliver some moldy socks to a peasant and be given a small fortune. This mod addresses the latter problem by reducing the amount of gold gained from favour quests by ~2/3.\r<br />\r<br />This mod requires Dragonborn&#33; I make mods for my own use and so I will not be supporting users that lack the official DLCs.
