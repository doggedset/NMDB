I\\'m sort of new to modding, and will probably only delve into changing gameplay elements and stay away from textures, graphics, and modeling.\r\nI acknowledge that this mod may not be 100% Lore Friendly.\r\nAnyway, I\\'m also of course new to balancing and such, so please comment with any suggestions on changing the damage modifiers.\r\nLikewise, please leave feedback about any bugs, mod conflicts, or suggestions for further development or even small things such as description changes (I\\'m really iffy on Dangerous Game).\r\n\r\n[b][u]Outside Mod Suggestions:[/b][/u]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7308]Skill Interface Retexture[/url] by Tko007:[/b] The new mini-constellation blends in much better with this mod\\'s texture enhancements.\r\n[*][b][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10037]Improved Archery and Bows[/url] by RealJames:[/b] This mod works very well to even further enhance the use of the Archery skill.\r\n[*][b][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11623]Spend Dragon Souls For Perks[/url] by DarkSeraphim85:[/b] As this mod adds 5 new perks (and 2 optional ranks) to the game, this mod is good for balancing out your perk point usage.\r\n[/list]",
