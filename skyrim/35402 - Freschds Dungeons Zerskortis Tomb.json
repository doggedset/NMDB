  "summary": "I personally find that the dungeons of Skyrim get boring when you play it the 2nd or 3rd time.\r\nBecause of this I started to mod my own dungoens to improve the further fun with Skyrim.\r\nAnd now I want to share my dungeons with you.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[What is this mod good for?]-------\r\n\r\nThis mod will add new dungeons into your Skyrim to improve the fun you have while you are playing. The second one is out !\r\n\r\n[Installation]---------\r\n\r\nJust download the file and drag and drop it in your Skyrim>Data direction.\r\nThe Skyrim folder can be found in the Steam folder. You just have to got to your Steam folder,kilck on it then go into the SteamApps folder and when you are in there you go in the common folder. There is your Skyrim folder.\r\n\r\n[What can I expect?]-----\r\n\r\nI really mod with love. I do my very best to let the dungeons look better than Vanilla Skyrim.\r\nBut that is hard and take time.\r\nBut you can definitely look forward to explore unique places,handwritten notes,\\\"epic\\\" battles and the other stuff that i don\\'t remember ;)\r\n\r\n[Will you do more?]------\r\n\r\nOf course I will. Even if nobody will play this dungeons I will upload them.But like I said before that take some time.\r\n\r\n[The unnecessary stuff....]------\r\n\r\nFirst of all this is/are my first mods so please don\\'t release the haters and trolls at the beginning.\r\nLike you can see my English is not the best. I am German. But i do my best so you can understand what I am writing here.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to comment and to share your impressions or/and criticism with me. When you have questions or some other things than write an pm.Of course you can also tell me what you would add to improve the dungeons.\r\nA big THANKS to all who are going to play this dungeons :)",
