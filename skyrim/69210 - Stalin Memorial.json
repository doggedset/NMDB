Also he loved listening to the TESV soundtracks so he always kept purring whenever I put the speakers on, lying in my lap chilling like a real dragon slayer. Or maybe just because it was cozy and not the music, but you can always imagine.\n<br />\n<br />He's named after his 'stache which was the first thing my friend shouted when she saw him, since after it has become an inside joke that our apartment and his cat-bed is/was named Stalingrad.\n<br />\n<br />I had the pleasure of caring for him for 2½ years before he unexpectedly fell desperately ill and passed in less than 36 hours.\n<br />[size=1]Nothing could be done.\n<br />All I can say is at least he didn't suffer for very long, but it breaks my heart.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />Rest in peace my dear.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />~\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This memorial is for me, but I felt I wanted to share it if anyone wants to have pretty little addition to the Falkreath Graveyard.\n<br />As well as I have a couple of friends on here who have met him.[/center]\n<br />[center][b][size=3][color=#ff0000]Content:[/color]\n<br />[/size][/b]\n<br />Similar to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63583/?]Bear - In memory of Taylor[/url].\n<br />Although this is nowhere far as elaborate, I still felt that I needed to do this in order to process the situation.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff0000][size=3]What about you?[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />I don't care if it's incompatible with any city or graveyard-mods, more as well as I don't use any city overhauls.\n<br />\n<br />This is for me so I can process my grief, not for your sake.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff0000][size=3]Credits:[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1329-insanitys-headstones/]Insanitysorrow[/url] for the grave meshes.\n<br />\n<br />DarkMatter88 sent me a lovely mail with a custom text for the headstone.\n<br />I am so very grateful and moved by the gesture so I just had to update the mod so it would be included.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Thank you[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[Edit]\n<br />2017-06-02\n<br />\n<br />Do NOT link this to other sites!",
