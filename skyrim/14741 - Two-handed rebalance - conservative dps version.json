  "descriptionHtml": "Firstly, this is not really my own work; It\\'s only a minor re-balancing of machinocracy\\'s mod \\'Two-handed rebalance\\'\r\n\r\nIf you haven\\'t seen his mod, I strongly recommend you go and check that out first: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11159]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11159[/url]\r\n\r\nIf nothing else, you should at least read his readme since done a fair amount of work into explaining why his mod was necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Why this version[/b]\r\n\r\nI really loved the original mod.  I\\'ve always loved 2h weapons in this kind of game but always felt that skyrim\\'s 2h weapons were just a bit too slow and unweildy.  Invariably 2h combat just ended up as an exchange of blows since you could never finish a strike fast enough to block any incoming attack, and evasion was extremely difficult for the same reason.  Machinocracy\\'s mod, although quite simple, really brought 2h combat back to life.\r\n\r\nBut I always felt it was just a little too much like cheating.  Even on master mode it felt just a tiny be too easy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]What does this version do?[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]It reduces the damage awarded by each level of the barbarian perk by 5%.[/b]\r\n\r\nTwo-handed rebalance increases speed of 2h attacks by 30%, increasing the overall DPS by 30%.  While 2-handed swords should have a higher dps than a single 1 handed sword, I think 30% more is a bit too much.  30% extra damage would be equivalent to a dual-weild setup, but there are many non-dps benefits in using 2h over dual weild (you can block, stagger-locking).\r\n\r\n[b]At top level, barbarian will now award 75% extra damage. (or 1.75 * base instead of 2.0 * base)[/b]\r\n[b]Original version: 2.0 * 1.3 = base dps multiplied by 2.6 by perks[/b]\r\n[b]This Version: 1.75 * 1.3 = base dps multiplied by 2.275 by perks[/b]\r\n[b]Vanilla Version: 2.0 * 1 = base dps multiplied by 2 by perks[/b]\r\n\r\n",
