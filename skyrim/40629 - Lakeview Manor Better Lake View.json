  "descriptionHtml": "---REQUIRES HEARTHFIRE---\r\nThis is a simple mod that removes the trees and turns them into stumps between the home in Falreath hold, Lakeview Manor, which is added by Hearthfire, and Lake Ilinalta. This makes the view of the lake much better (in my opinion) and is also an immersive mod as the trees don\\'t disappear, they turn into stumps, just as if they have been cut down for the players pleasure.",
