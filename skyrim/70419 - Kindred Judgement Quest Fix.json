  "descriptionHtml": "On some occasions, after Gelebor gives you Auriel&#39;s Bow, the Dawnguard quesline will break and you won&#39;t be able to advance to the next quest (Kindred Judgement), my guess is this is caused by a mod conflict and for some reason the setstage console command doesn&#39;t work, this mod fixes that.\r<br />\r<br />VERY IMPORTANT: AFTER YOU ACTIVATE THE MOD AND PICK UP AURIEL&#39;S BOW, YOU STILL NEED TO USE THE FOLLOWING CONSOLE COMMAND:\r<br />\r<br />setstage DLC1VQ08 20\r<br />\r<br />Remember to only use the command AFTER you pick up Auriel&#39;s Bow.\r<br />\r<br />If you attack Volkihar and the door to the boss room is locked, type in the console: coc DLC1vampirecastlebossroom , this will teleport you to where Harkon is, kill him and leave the room, the quest should be over as soon as you kill him.",
