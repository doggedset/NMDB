  "descriptionHtml": "Sided with Hadvaar, took the horn from Delphine and got the full unrelenting force shout. Don\\'t think I agreed to talk to her about the dragons..I forget. Anyway Should be level 2 or so when you load  it.\r\n\r\n Place in Documents/My Games/Skyrim/Saves  you know the drill\r\n\r\n Everything was vanilla using generic nord male (preset one). No USKP used (although I added it later I\\'d strongly recommend). Defeated cultists etc.\r\n\r\nYeah nothing special just a save game, gets rid of the repetitive stuff. Claw needs to go back to the Riverwood trader, left it that way so you can level up more to get more gold. \r\n\r\nRequirement: All DLC!",
