  "summary": "Converts the random encounter Dark Brotherhood assassins into more generic assassins that aren&#39;t obviously from the Dark Brotherhood.  A dying organization can&#39;t afford to throw away people like that.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This just changes the outfits that the Dark Brotherhood assassins that try to kill you on the road wear, as well as the note they carry.  They now dress the same as the thieves that try to mug you, and the note is much more enigmatic.  There is no indication that they come from the Dark Brotherhood.  It is ridiculous that they would throw dozens of inept assassins at you in the shape they are in (or any shape).",
