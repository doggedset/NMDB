  "summary": "Standalone Light Armor Set, designed by Skyforge mastersmith Eorlund. Nord design meets Elven techniques. Totally lore-friendly, both Vanilla and UNP (optional).\r\nNew Hi-Res textures by Carah based on Cabal120\\'s work.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b][size=4][color=lightblue]UPDATE 1.2[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n- Added a full HEAVY SET on request. It\\'s named [b][color=lightblue]Quicksilver Skyforge[/b][/color] Armor/gauntlets/boots/helm. Horned Helm instead of a crown. Stats are more or less Ebony armor stats.\r\n- Added both armor sets to Eorlund\\'s inventory so you can buy them if you can - they\\'re very expensive!\r\n- Optimized (but not downgraded!) textures with Ordenator.\r\n- Fix: added missing gauntlet meshes for Beast races.\r\n\r\n[b][size=4][color=lightblue]DESCRIPTION[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n- Standalone full Light and Heavy Armor Sets: cuirass, gauntlets, boots and crown - an armored circlet replaces the light helmet. This crown is named \\\"[b]Frostfall Crown[/b]\\\". Retextured Horned helm for the heavy set.\r\n- New, Hi-Res (HD) custom textures by lady [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/691792]Carah[/url], based on [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/571605]CaBal120[/url]\\'s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18272]aMidianBorn steel retextures[/url], with his authorization. He\\'s remaking a new version btw. All credits for the meshes & textures go to Cabal20 and Carah.\r\n- STATS are about the same as Glass Armor (light) and Ebony Armor (heavy).\r\n- Can be forged at the Skyforge only, under STEEL - Read the Background below.\r\n- Can be fully tempered and enchanted.\r\n- Requires the \\\"Advanced Armors\\\" smithing perk. Background too!\r\n- Complete sets so all armor perks apply (considered Steelplate Material by the game).\r\n- Available to all races, including beast ones - see my pics.\r\n- Body: works with all body mods. The female armor meshes use a UNP shaped body but that shouldn\\'t conflict. You will just get a (IMO) better shaped armor than the main steel cuirass.\r\n\r\n[b][size=4][color=lightblue]INSTALL[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\n- Use NMM, or\r\n- Download manually, extract and copy/paste the Data folder into your Skyrim main folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n... Do you want to know more?\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=4][color=lightblue]BACKGROUND STORY[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nA long time ago, when he was young, Eorlund Grey-Mane fought against the Adlmeri Dominion, during the Great War that almost destroyed the Empire, leaving it with an uncertain status-quo. During that war, he noticed that the Thalmor troops were equipped with full, solid armors made of moonstone, quicksilver and malachite. They covered all the body, but were much lighter than the heaviest imperial, nor or redguard armors. The elven armors were not only lighter, but as resistant as orcish armors. That gave a tremendous advantage to the Dominion during battles. It was one of the reasons why the Dominion troops could move so fast all across the Empire.\r\n\r\nPutting aside his hatred of high elves, Eorlund studied his enemies forging techniques, in order to apply them to his own ancestral knowledge of Nord smithing. During the years, he perfected his skills and included what he learned from the Great War, merging elven and nordic smithing process. The result was an armor as strong as malachite, but three times lighter and more flexible than the best nord steel armors. Eorlund kept the classic nordic design and used mostly quicksilver, a rare and highly priced material, extremely difficult to work with. This armor requires the fires of the Skyforge and years of practice to be forged. Therefore, a younger smith needs Eorlund\\'s supervision and advices to make one - if he wishes to teach you. Quicksilver being very expensive, this armor cannot be massively produced, and only the elite of the Nords can afford it... or a good smith who happens to befriend Eorlund and the Companions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=4][color=lightblue]NOTES[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nWhy light armor too? I thought the basic design of the steel armor could be better exploited. Also, high ranking light armors are also full body / full plate armors. Look at the elven, glass and draconic ones. The difference is the material used - see background.\r\n\r\nTell me on comments if I forgot something.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=4][color=lightblue]FUTURE DEVS / WIP[/b][/size][/color]\r\n\r\nOn request (maybe) as I just did the heavy set.\r\n\r\nFrench Version included in \\\"Optional\\\" / Version Francophone inclue dans \\\"Optional\\\".\r\nLa couronne (casque l√©ger) s\\'appelle \\\"Couronne de Vifazur\\\".",
