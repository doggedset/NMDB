  "descriptionHtml": "Simplified Skyrim Main Menu Screen Replacers by insane0hflex (aka svaalbard on the Skyrim Nexus).\r\n\r\n[img]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/25875-1-1350920457.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[size=15][b]Description[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nThis mod is rather a simple one - it will replace the the black menu screen and the Skyrim symbol/logo, with a \\\"Simplified\\\" screenshot.\r\n\r\nThese are all screenshots I took that have been processed in Photoshop to have a painting like appearance, for a simple and visually pleasing look. \r\n\r\nThese are not individually painted pieces of digital art.\r\n\r\nIn total - there are 20 different main menu replacers to choose from. Check out images tab for a preview of every main menu replacer. Also, feel free to submit me your screenshots if you want me to \\\"simplify\\\" it, and include it in the next release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=15][b]How to Install[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n1. Download, then extract simplified_skyrim_main_menu_wallpaper_replacers.zip to any location.\r\n\r\n2. Open the simplified_skyrim_main_menu_wallpaper_replacers folder, and you\\'ll see a DATA folder.\r\n\r\n3. Copy paste the DATA folder to C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\\r\n\r\n4. You might be asked to overwrite or merge files/folders, click yes to all.\r\n\r\n5. Now, to choose a simplified main menu to replace the default one - the name of the folder is the general name/concept behind the screenshot. In the folder, there is also a \\\"preview\\\" image you can view to see if you like it or not.\r\n\r\n6. Copy that file inside the folder, which is called mainmenuwallpaper.dds, and place it into:\r\n\r\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\interface\\\\objects\\\\\r\n\r\n7. If you are asked to replace whatever file that is (mainmenuwallpaper.dds), select yes if you wish to do so.\r\n\r\n8. Start Skyrim and enjoy!\r\n\r\nAlso - I highly recommend to get No Loading Menu Smoke - removes the fog/smoke fx on loading screens and the main menu. http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7901\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=15][b]How to Uninstall[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n1. Delete the mainmenuwallpaper.dds file in C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\interface\\\\objects\\\\\r\n\r\n2. Delete logo.nif in C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\meshes\\\\logo\\\\\r\n\r\n[size=15][b]Credits and Thanks[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nFor hellstorm102 for the logo.nif (used with his permission).\r\nFor Dark0ne and all admins of the Nexus Network, for a great and easy to use website to share mods for Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim.",
