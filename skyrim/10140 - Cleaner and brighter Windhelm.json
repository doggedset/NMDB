  "descriptionHtml": "I always found Windhelm the most ugly city in Skyrim, so i decided to make it much lovelier by adding vegetation, more light sources and removing the ugly parts like snow hills.   \r\n\r\n\r\nInformation:\r\n-Removed half of the graves and added some trees instead\r\n-Added much green vegetation and fences to the left graves to make a nice graveyard\r\n-Added fences at stairs to make the city more structured\r\n-Added torches to light up some dark corners in Windhelm\r\n-Added vegetation in the area around Hjerim \r\n-Added much banners with Stormcloak symbols on it, if you don\\'t like it there is \r\n an alternate file without banners\r\n-Huge fire in the middle of the market\r\n \r\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n-The old woman is still walking her path but there are no graves anymore(should not be a problem)\r\n-If you find more buggs tell me please\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have ideas for me to change or add tell me please.\r\nThank you for downloading my mod. \r\nPlease endorse if you like it.",
