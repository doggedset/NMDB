  "descriptionHtml": "I was never pleased with just having a quiver on my back, and armed for the teeth was too much of a hassle. So, this mod adds a bunch of stuff to your back whilst the quiver is equipped, akin to mods that are travel packs. \r\n\r\n-Craftable arrows\r\n-Nord quiver, but shoots steel arrows\r\n-Ebony damage rating\r\n\r\nApologies on the images, I just wanted to call this one finished. \r\n\r\nI was far to lazy to retexture these items myself, however: this mod will take any of the textures you\\'ve applied to anything you see on the quiver, as they rely on the vanilla textures. \r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy lookin\\' even more badass.
