The tower is located East of Windhelm, and is currently completely vacant. The tower&#39;s interior is 3 floors, with a large basement intended to be a work area. The plaza features a mysterious statue with the ability to call dragons. (Dragons level with the player)\r<br />\r<br />This mod is very much a work in progress, and features little aside from the dragon spawner. Suggestions and support, however, would be greatly appreciated.[/center]   [center][/center]",
