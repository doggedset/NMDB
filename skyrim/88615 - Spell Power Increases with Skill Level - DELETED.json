  "summary": "The effectiveness of spells will increase with a mage's skill level.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is self explanatory: as your skill level in a certain school magic gets higher, your spells from that school will become more effective. For some ungodly reason, that's not a feature in the base game. Without this mod, your skill level only reduces the cost of spells, which doesn't have as much of an effect on NPCs.",
