  "descriptionHtml": "Hi, this is my first ever mod-release so please be gentle :)\r\n\r\nI Always felt like the game has an issue with storage in the beginning, yet i don\\'t like to install Houses and feel like i get a cheapshot at the early stages.. so i figured i\\'d simply add this small, imo very immersive solution..\r\n\r\nThis mod simply adds/replaces a Chest in both Faendal\\'s and Sven\\'s house in Riverwood. So wich ever companion you prefer, you will be allowed to store some items in their house. (without the fear of respawning containers ofc)\r\n\r\nSimply get them as a companion, take the key to their house and use the chest as u see fit.\r\n\r\nInstall: Just put the .esp file into your skyrim/data folder and make sure it is checked\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chest is called \\\"YourChest\\\" so it should be easy to identify.. It is also empty by default.\r\nTechnically you could use both chests since their ownership to the player is not linked with them being or not being your companion simply ignore the fact that there is a chest called you chest in the other house shouldn\\'t interfere with roleplay too much ;)\r\n\r\n(KEEP IN MIND ALL THE OTHER THINGS IN THE HOUSES ARE AS THEY WERE BEFORE INCLUDING THEIR RELATIVE OWNERSHIP AND PROPERTIES)\r\n\r\nAlso note that other mods that change the interior cells to those houses might interfere with this mod..\r\n\r\nHave Fun with your Chest :D",
