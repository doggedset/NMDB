  "descriptionHtml": "Vandit Lenala, A notorious thief from Cyrodiil whose life was full of regrets and mistakes and was looking for a new start in Skyrim where she could hopefully put her troubles behind her, So she set on a voyage  upon the sea vessel The Shiny Horker and was headed off towards Dawnstar, but on her way there the ship was caught in a severe storm and ended up crashing up on some rocks just north of Dawnstar. She is the only survivor of the wreck and is stranded on a sinking boat, She must now recall her talents to escape and get to safety.\r\n\r\nOk first of, I am not a modder and this is indeed my first upload to the site, thought i would create a character to share with everyone. She has no real backstory (Just something i typed up real fast!) and is ready for a new story full of adventure( She is level 1 and has defualt skill\\'s/talents spells etc). I used the Alternate Start mod by Arthmoor and is required for this save. Also a few other mods i will list below. Anyways thanks for taking a look at my first mod/saved game and look forward to your opinions!\r\n\r\n~Mods Required~\r\n(For the same save in the screen shots)\r\n\r\nAlternate Start - Live Another Life \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9557\r\n\r\nDIMONIZED UNP female body\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709\r\n\r\n ApachiiSkyHair\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\r\n \r\nBetter Females by Bella\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n~Other mods, Not Needed ~\r\nApachiiSkyHair NPC Overhaul\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15411\r\n\r\nA Quality Word Map\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4929\r\n\r\nImmersive Armors\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19733\r\n\r\nCrimson Tide - Blood \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12798\r\n\r\nThe Eyes Of Beauty \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13722\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
