  "modName": "Babes of Skyrim Vampire Head fix",
  "summary": "This is my FaceGen data i did for the Babes of Skyrim mod covering only vampires",
  "descriptionHtml": "So as suggested by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3287685]Rhonen5[/url] on the Beautiful Vampires V2 mod, I just ran the CK with babes and all its requirements and the Legendary skyrim patch which the mod author [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3419587]Dar0ne45[/url] stated in the Babes of Skyrim(Vanilla Replacer) was causing errors with some settings it was altering in his mod. I generated the facegen for the vampires and just added it to my MO and it fixed the faces, you also need Vampire Skin Color FIX by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4958627]Loshirai14[/url] at the bottom of your load order. I tried the patch [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3287685]Rhonen5[/url] uploaded on the same subject but it didnt fix the problem so, here you go.\r<br />\r<br />I would suggest to use it if you have my exact settings which should be the same as babes uses all the mods i loaded into CK as master files so... You cant run babes without them.\r<br />\r<br />Also, I just want to point out you can add the fangs of BVFE - Better Vampire Fangs and Eyes just by coping the mouth tri files in the same folder structure provided by the mod if you just want the fangs as i do.\r<br />\r<br />Hope it fixes your faces and if you want me to generate more facegen files for something missing i havent yet see(like bandits, witchs,  stormcloack soldiers or any other generic npc) just ask.",
