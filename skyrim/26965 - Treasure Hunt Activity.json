  "descriptionHtml": "This is the first mod I\\'ve ever made so please don\\'t judge it to harshly, if you like this kind of thing then message me and I\\'ll make more. This is a little treasure hunt thingy that i decided to make, it\\\\\\'s not a quest but just something fun to do, you can find a little note in the Riverwood trader, second floor that tells you whats going on. \r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: I messed up the part at the sky forge and will re-upload the new file in the morning, for some reason the last note wasn\\'t appearing, not sure why, but it should be an easy fix, if anyone is curious the treasure is behind the *Spoiler* Riverwood Trader .\r\n\r\nIf anyone is willing to tell me if they encounter anything wrong with the mod just put something in the comment section and I\\'ll try and reply asap. \r\n\r\nAt the moment I\\'m also starting a mod for Skyrim where there is a so called zombie Apocalypse, I might use the Draugr for the so called zombies but I\\'m not to sure at the moment, if this ideas appeals to you then just leave a comment or message me. :)",
