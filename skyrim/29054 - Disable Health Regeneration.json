  "descriptionHtml": "This mod disables passive health regeneration and fixes the problem that forces health regeneration to turn back on later in the game, for those of you that enjoy a more oldschool elderscrolls experience. \r\n\r\nWhat the .esp does is disable extra health regeneration given to you by a few abilities you acquire in the game which shouldn\\'t be granting that affect, such as Force Without Effort. The mod is turned on and off using a console command (you only need to do this once and the changes stick between saves). This makes the mod very easy to uninstall. \r\n\r\nIf you have other mods that introduce health regeneration through abilities this mod will not work. Should work with custom races.\r\nHealth regeneration potions still work along with health regeneration buffs (like enchantments).",
