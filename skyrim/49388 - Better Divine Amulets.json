  "summary": "Increases the power and usefulness of the divine amulets.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I always thought that the various amulets of the divines were nice looking, especially how they each had a unique model from the usual gold and silver ones you can find, but their bonuses were just...not good.  In my opinion, Talos&#39; amulet was the only one even worth consideration in vanilla, which was a shame, because I thought they were quite useful for role playing purposes, if you were playing a devout character who followed a particular god, or just because you liked the way they looked.\r<br />\r<br />So I made them all stronger.  Some of the new strengths will probably be a little overpowered for brand new characters or those who are still at a low level, but will quickly even out as you get stronger and are definitely not as strong as the best custom things you can craft if you choose to pursue enchanting to any serious degree.\r<br />\r<br />In effort to not change the overall feel of each divine blessing, I did not add extra bonuses, but rather simply increased the potency of whatever bonus each amulet already had, with two exceptions, namely the amulets of Arkay and Kynareth respectively.\r<br />\r<br />The changes are:\r<br />\r<br />Akatosh: Upped magic regen to 50%.\r<br />Arkay: Changed fortify health into health regen at 50%.\r<br />Dibella: Upped fortify persuasion to 25 points.\r<br />Julianos: Upped fortify magicka to 50 points.\r<br />Kynareth: Changed fortify stamina into stamina regen at 50%.\r<br />Mara: Upped fortify restoration to 25 points.\r<br />Stendarr: Upped fortify block to 25 points.\r<br />Talos: Upped fortify shouts to .50 points (50% cooldown instead of vanilla 20%).\r<br />Zenithar: Upped fortify barter to 25 points.\r<br />\r<br />Installation: Drop the esp file in your data folder and make sure it&#39;s checked active in your modlist.\r<br />Uninstallation: Delete the esp.\r<br />Compatibility: Should work with anything that doesn&#39;t alter the religious amulet enchantments.",
