  "summary": "Adds a new , equal looking , light armor set, to be foundin a Custom Cave with the coc 01Cave command.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Since I didnt like the Dragonscale Light Armor and it misfits the daedric weapons , I just threw this together rather quickly. Its my first mod and fairly basic. I have Updated it so now you can get it by Crafting (Daedric Armor Perk Required) and you can Enchant + Temper it.\r\n\r\nIf anyone could spare the time, I am looking for someone talented in Modeling and Texturing to actually make it look light, as its is just a workaround right now.\r\n",
