  "summary": "A small, hunter-themed player home in Dawnstar.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a small player home in Dawnstar - I always liked the city and wanted to create a player home that feels real, a place where someone could actually live and work. I went for a hunter-themed house, so there is everything a hunter needs: chopping block, tanning rack, salt to conserve the meat, hooks for the meat, barrels and chests, etc.\r\nOf course there are also various containers, as well as weapon plaques and mannequins to display your trophies - but just a few, because I didn\\'t want to overdo it and putting a \\\"secret\\\" basement with 25 mannequins in a house like that (as some modders do) just feels silly to me.\r\nAlso, I created a few static versions of items from the game, because I hate when everything goes rickety-boom because of the havok engine when you so much as look at the stuff the wrong way. So don\\'t be surprised if there are some things in the house you cannot pick up, that normally can be picked up.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy my mod! Have fun!\r\n\r\nEDIT: After reading the comments I decided to create a new version without the mannequins and weapons plaques on the upper floor - they did feel out of place, now the upper floor looks like the work area of a hunter\\'s home (and the house really deserves the name \\\"Horkertusk Home\\\"). I left the old version up in case someone wants to keep the mannequins.\r\nI also made an alternate version where the mannequin and single bed on the lower floor are replaced with a double bed - for all those hunters that like to share a bed with their companion.",
