Today I bring you some decorations for Valentine&#39;s Day, for you to give to your loved ones&#33; (And yes, I know this mod is most likely not lore-friendly, so don&#39;t bother pointing that out, thanks.)[/center]\r<br />\r<br />Featuring a cute little shop, The Golden Rose, this mod adds mouth-watering chocolates, delicious pastries and an assortment of gifts for you to regale your friends and family. German translation available [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58826/]here[/url]. Thanks, Taryl80&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The file has been cleaned with TES5EDIT, does not require any DLC, and has no scripts, so it should be safe for everybody to use. Still, you should always make a backup save before installing ANY mod, in case something goes wrong.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/Q09dr48.png[/img][/center]As this is a very simple mod and I do not plan on making it any more elaborate, it will require you to use your imagination. You can buy the new Valentine&#39;s items from the vendor and give them to your followers through their usual dialogue, simply placing their presents in their inventory. I know it will probably be disappointing for some, and I apologize in advance. Of course, you can simply buy the decorations and place them around your house, as well.\r<br />\r<br />Just like I did with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47524/?]The Merry Snowberry[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59483/?]The Bloody Tankard[/url], everything is buyable and droppable for maximum compatibility; none of the items have been added to leveled lists or placed around the world. I made it so you could install it and keep it, instead of feeling you should uninstall the mod once the celebrations are over ;)\r<br />\r<br />The Golden Rose is located in Falkreath, near [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Falkreath_Watchtower]Falkreath Watchtower[/url]. It comes with an enabled map marker, so you can travel to it right away. The vendor works 24/7, so drop by anytime&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center]Here&#39;s a beautiful showcase by the fine MMOxReiew (skip to 8:04 to see)\r<br />[youtube]llH87vOvLlA[/youtube][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/2s5TktT.png[/img][/center]Extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use the Mod Manager to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files with the name [font=courier]  &#34;ValentinesShop&#34;  [/font] from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/wmm0TzV.png[/img][/center]\r<br />I don&#39;t think there could be many issues with compatibility with other mods, unless they make MASSIVE changes to the area I worked on. If you find any mod that causes trouble, please let me know so I can list them here.\r<br />\r<br />Some of the new items have finicky collision, and may sink through the floor or roll around. I tried to fix them, but just so you know, sometimes they may require some roughhousing in order to stand upright. Lifting them above the ground and dropping them seems to work.\r<br />\r<br />The new consumables are compatible out-of-the-box with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60270/?]RND - Universal Compatibility Patch[/url]. [i][b]I will not make a dedicated patch for it or any other needs mods.[/b][/i] If you want to make one, feel free to do so. You are welcome to send it to me, if you&#39;d like to have it uploaded here -- with credits, of course.\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/b3XIhHp.png[/img][/center]- [b]Feb 10, 2014[/b]: [i]Initial release.[/i]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/zjNGDhP.png[/img][/center]Special thanks go to my friends at the Black Mesa Steam chatroom, who helped me with some lame Valentine&#39;s wishes for the book, tested the mod, and kept me entertained while working, and played Elder Scrolls Online with me when the servers worked. That said, also thanks to the ESO team - if it wasn&#39;t for their servers being down for a big part of the weekend, I would never have found the time to work on this&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I used plenty of modder&#39;s resources from around the web to make this:\r<br />\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30602/?]Ingredients Wall Art Resource[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14134/]OpenBooks Resource[/url] by Blary.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24827/?]Strotis Small House Resource[/url] by Stroti and Tamira.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16525/]Modders Resource Pack[/url] by Oaristys and Tony67.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26132/?]Resources for modders[/url] by Runspect.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12884/? ]Book Covers Resource[/url] by Axhoff.\r<br />- [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36756/?]Berts Bits And Bobs[/url] by berticus0001.\r<br />- [url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1379-christmas-resource/]Christmas Resource[/url] and [url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1203-insanitys-food-stuffs-resource/]Food Stuffs Resource[/url] by InsanitySorrow.\r<br />- [url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1264-catering-by-lilith/]Catering[/url] by Lilith.\r<br />- Yellow Rose vector art courtesy of [url=http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-83996263/stock-vector-yellow-rose.html]Tribalium[/url].\r<br />\r<br />Thank you for reading this huge wall of text, and happy Valentine&#39;s Day&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
