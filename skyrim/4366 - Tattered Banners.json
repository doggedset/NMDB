  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://img854.imageshack.us/img854/9045/tbtitle4.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[size=4]== INTRODUCTION ==[/size]\r\n\r\nI\\'ve been working on this mod for a few weeks now, and every time I get close to a final edit I seem to think of some new technique to try out, leading to days of reworking and a whole new iteration. Even now I have some ideas I want to try out that might make for even more convincing wear and tear effects, but the run-up to Christmas has been suddenly very busy and I wanted to release this now to get some initial feedback before I get too carried away again.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s still a work-in-progress, so please tell me what you think - I\\'m still tweaking the final look and will probably make a few overhauls before the next edition. I also have plans for a better-condition version with no tears or rips, and maybe even one with the tears and rips noticably sewn and repaired with patches.\r\n\r\n[url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1307735-wipz-tattered-banners]WIP Thread[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4]== DESCRIPTION ==[/size]\r\n\r\nThis mod revamps the banners in Skyrim to have greater detail and a more realistic appearance of cloth, while maintaining their original style. It uses the default game textures for their design and color, but I\\'ve added new fabric textures and weathering effects to give them more depth, and spent a long time redoing the alpha channels to improve the fraying pattern. Taking Bethesda\\'s design as a guide, and considering that these banners have to endure years of constant snow, wind, rain, ice, civil wars, and dragon attacks, the banners now look as though they\\'ve weathered the harshest of Skyrim\\'s climate.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4]== DETAILS ==[/size]\r\n\r\nThis mod is a work in progress, and more banners will be added as the project continues. Also, because it\\'s not just a simple resolution increase, I can\\'t make these changes blindly and can thus only mod the banners which I\\'ve found in the game. If you happen across one of the ones I haven\\'t covered yet, please let me know where it is!\r\n\r\nIncluded so far:\r\n\r\n- Whiterun city banner\r\n- Solitude city banner\r\n- Riften city banner\r\n- Hjaalmarch (Morthal) city banner\r\n- Winterhold city banner\r\n- Falkreath city banner\r\n- Dawnstar city banner\r\n- Imperial legion camp banner\r\n- Stormcloak camp banner\r\n- Mara\\'s temple banner (in Riften)\r\n\r\nStill in progress:\r\n\r\n- 5 generic color banners\r\n- Potema\\'s banner\r\n- Arkay temple banner\r\n- Mythic Dawn banner\r\n- College of Winterhold banner\r\n- Sovngarde banner\r\n- High Hrothgar banners\r\n- Dwarven ruin banner\r\n\r\nNot yet found:\r\n\r\n- Thief guild banner\r\n- Summerset banner\r\n\r\nOther banners (Windhelm, Markarth, and the Companions Hall) don\\'t have that Swiss-cheese cutout pattern, so they don\\'t really fall into the \\\"tattered banner\\\" category - however, I may revamp those too in a future update to match the look of all the banners.\r\n\r\nAgain, if you come across a banner that hasn\\'t been covered, please let me know so I can add it to the mod. Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4]== INSTALLATION ==[/size]\r\n\r\nUnzip the \\\"textures\\\" folder from the archive into your Skyrim\\\\Data folder.\r\n\r\n(This will replace the textures of the included banners listed above.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4]== UNINSTALLATION ==[/size]\r\n\r\nRemove the following files from your Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\clutter folder:\r\n\r\ncitybannerdawnstar01.dds\r\ncitybannerfalkreath01.dds\r\ncitybannerhjaalmarch01.dds\r\ncitybannerriften01.dds\r\ncitybannersolitude01.dds\r\ncitybannerwhiterun01.dds\r\ncitybannerwinterhold01.dds\r\ncivilwarbannerburnt01.dds\r\ncivilwarbanners01.dds\r\ncivilwarbanners01_n.dds\r\ngenericbanner01_n.dds\r\ntemplebannerriften01.dds\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4]== VERSION HISTORY ==[/size]\r\n\r\n0.1 Initial release\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4]== ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ==[/size]\r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for their great art design of the base textures.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4]== LEGAL ==[/size]\r\n\r\nPlease contact me before redistributing this mod.\r\nDo not use assets from the mod without permission.",
