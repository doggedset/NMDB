  "descriptionHtml": "A small mod that lets you change your run speed and jump height in-game. You can also save 3 presets each for quick changes. Your previous settings get loaded when you load a save, so you don\\'t have to keep setting the jump height on save reloads.\r\n\r\nRequired Files:\r\nSKSE is required in order to change the jump height game setting. You can get it here:\r\nhttp://skse.silverlock.org/  \r\nJust download skse, extract it to your root Skyrim folder. If prompted, answer \\'yes\\' to combining folders. Make a link on your desktop that points to the skse_loader.exe (found in your Skyrim root folder). And that\\'s it! Launch your game using the skse loader shortcut.\r\n\r\nHow to use Jump Run Changer:\r\nExtract and place files in your Skyrim data folder, answering \\\"yes\\\" if it wants to overwrite files or combine folders.\r\nWhen the game is launched, you\\'ll get a token in your inventory apparel section called \\'+Jump-Run+ and it will be located at the top of the list. Equip this item and close the inventory. A menu will pop up allowing you to change your jump height, run speed, set presets, or load presets. \r\n\r\nTip: For fast changes, hotkey the Jump-Run token and setup presets.",
