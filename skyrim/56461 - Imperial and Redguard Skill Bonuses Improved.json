  "descriptionHtml": "This mod changes the starting Skill Bonuses for Imperial&#39;s and Redguard&#39;s to fit with the Lore a little more.\r<br />\r<br />Imperial&#39;s now have +10 speech instead of +10 Restoration. I felt like they need good Speech since they are said to be shrewd diplomats and traders.\r<br />\r<br />Redguard now have Skill Bonuses that fit a Warrior build like Redguard&#39;s are intended to be. Magic is heavily frowned upon in Redguard society, so now they dont have the strange +5 to Destruction and Alteration, and now have better Smithing and Heavy armor for more variety.\r<br />\r<br />Feel free to suggest more Race&#39;s to change :)\r<br />\r<br />The Installtion is very simple. Just drop the .esp file into your skyrim directory.\r<br />To Uninstall simply remove the .esp file from your Skyrim directory\r<br />\r<br />Hope you enjoy my first mod :)",
