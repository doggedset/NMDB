  "modName": "Arabic Redguard Names",
  "summary": "Updates the names of most Redguards in the game to longer, lore friendly Arabic ones.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod edits the names of Redguards in the base game and dlc&#39;s to be closer to the Arabic names.\r<br />\r<br />The names are based on the Andalusian (Spanish Muslim) model of naming as the Redguards most closely resemble the Moors of Iberia.\r<br />Naming conventions taken from: https://goo.gl/Zd3Tfs\r<br />\r<br />Examples:\r<br />Nazeem Al-Whiterun Juz-Alhind (Nazeem of Whiterun, the Cocunut)\r<br />Armen Al-Sahara Almualia (Armen of the desert, the Loyal)\r<br />Anwen Abd-Dibella Bint-Hamal (Anwen, servant of Dibella, daughter of Hamal)\r<br />\r<br />More important Redguards such as Isran and Nazir have longer names, for example:\r<br />Almabarizalzzalam Nazir Min-Alssahra&#39;Alhumra&#39;a Abd-Sithis ( The Dark Swordsman, Nazir, Of the Red Desert, Slave of Sithis)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The translations aren&#39;t always 100% accurate but unless you speak Arabic you won&#39;t notice.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy",
