  "descriptionHtml": "MESSAGE:\r<br />[color=blue][center][size=13]\r<br />Update 1.4.2 is out&#33; apologies for the time gap between updates recently, but with no &#34;Doctor Who&#34; to watch until the Fall, there&#39;s nothing more to add on to the update except for the bugs, which is what this update is focused on&#33;\r<br />The Time Lord race has been removed: I will re-add this race in a later update, but I believe that this race with the complicated generation aspect is what was causing many of the regeneration bugs. So I&#39;m removing the TL race altogether, and will slowly, but steadily, re-add them to Skyrim with little to no bugs.\r<br />A less buggy regeneration: I&#39;ve been playing around with papyrus, and believe that I created a regeneration that will activate at 20% health, 100% of the time. the script is identical to that of Kohnariik, except it is active on the Gallifreyan Amulet\r<br />The Amulet is more smoothly incorporated into the land of Skyrim. It can still be found in an NPC, but is now also somewhere else (BIG HINT&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;: I also put in a loading screen that says a rough group of bandits have invaded somewhere; keep your eyes peeled...).\r<br />\r<br />If you guys have any ideas you would like incorporated into the mod, let me know in the comments. I am always open to new ideas&#33; Thanks for continuing to support the Time Lord invasion of Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />[/color][/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=15][color=orange]Video sightings of Time Lords in Skyrim:[youtube]cqMQvKiiY6s[/youtube][/size][/center][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Fan of Doctor Who? Feel that there&#39;s an absence of Time Lords in Skyrim? Then this is the mod for you&#33; This mod allows you to change your race to a Time Lord, complete with its own description and powers. As Time Lords are technologically advanced, they are exceptionally powerful in the arcane arts, as well as around the forge. Being a Time Lord comes with two magic abilities: Last Resort, and Calming Aura. Last resort is the same power as the Konahriik (if that&#39;s how you spell it. The one found in Labrynthian in the dragon&#39;s mouth). Calming Aura is an upgraded version of Guardian Circle, at the very least, it wards off creatures up to Level 75 for 45 seconds. As you can imagine, regeneration is a huge concept in Dr. Who, and will take a while to perfect\r<br />\r<br />COMPATIBILITY:\r<br />\r<br />This Mod requires [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20394//?] ShowRaceMenu Alternative[/url] to set your race to Time Lord. Otherwise, every time you reload your save, you  will revert to your previous race\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This mod will also work great with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35774//?]the TARDIS[/url]:\r<br />\r<br />",

Not anymore&#33; Now, anyone around you will be engulfed in a lethal fire storm\r<br />- The mod is called \"Time Lords in Skyrim,\" so let&#39;s add some time lords&#33; Now the housecarls (Not including the ones from Dawnguard), Arngier, and the Jarl of Whiterun are Time Lords, and will regenerate if they are a little too close to death\r<br />- The argonian race has been converted to Silurians, as they are the most closely related races.\r<br />- There have been reports of a mysterious man by the name of John Smith wandering the hills of Skyrim. He was last seen in the Bannered Mare, in Whiterun.\r<br />- A new spell tome has been added to summon the Master from the Atronarch Forge in Winterhold. The ingredients are somewhere in Skyrim, but seem to wander\r<br />- So many more things that can&#39;t even begin to be named\r<br />\r<br />More updates coming soon, including a working fob watch, a voiced quest, more regeneration options, and much, much more&#33; <br/> \n",
