  "modName": "Another Conjuration Absorption Fix",
  "summary": "Conjuration spells won&#39;t be absorbed by the player&#39;s spell absorption effect. Options for Vanilla, Dawnguard AND Dragonborn, and Conjuration Madness.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Fed up with having to cast your summon spells 8 times to get them to work on your Atronach Stone mage? Me too. This mod modifies (hopefully) all relevant conjuration spells so they can no longer be absorbed. There are two versions, one for default Skyrim (no DLC) and one for Dragonborn AND Dawnguard (both DLC required)\r<br />\r<br />If you find that a (non-mod added) spell is still being absorbed, leave a comment with the spell, and I will update the mod ASAP to include it.\r<br />\r<br />This mod should be compatible with pretty much everything. If you discover a conflict, again, leave a comment with a report on your issue.\r<br />\r<br />For more bug fixes, check out the Unofficial Skyrim Patch. That mod is supposed to fix this issue, along with many others, and probably does, but something is overwriting that change for me, and blam-o, I made this to re-fix it. If you are having the same problem, use this mod along with the Patch for bug fixing overkill.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />***Optional***\r<br />\r<br />   - Patch for Conjuration Madness: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9331/? in the optional files. It requires the original mod, and my .esp must be after it in your load order. All 70 spells should be changed, but if you find one still getting absorbed, let me know.",
