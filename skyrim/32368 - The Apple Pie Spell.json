  "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever wanted to shoot apple pies in your enemies\\' face? I\\'m sure you do, and even if you didn\\'t, now you do xD\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a new spell and a new staff to the game. They can both be found in Farengars office. Upon use, they shoot apple pies from your hand, capable of killing your enemies. The apple pies burst in flames when they hit your target, and deal 50 damage. This might sound like much, but apple pies dont fly that fast.\r\n\r\nThe spell can be found in the Destruction tab, and the staff, ofcourse, in the Weapons tab.\r\nIf you have any suggestions to this mod, please share with us in the comments. And if you encounter any bug, also please share with us so I can fix it.",
