  "descriptionHtml": "Better Mage Scaling\r<br />----------------------------\r<br />\r<br />(See specific changes section for the changes this mod makes.)\r<br />\r<br />===========\r<br />Description\r<br />===========\r<br />\r<br />This mod helps make mages a little stronger toward higher levels, but not overpowered. It does this by increasing the magicka regeneration in combat and increasing the damage output gained by the Augmented Fire, Frost, and Shock perks. This way you start out doing the same amount of damage as you normally would, but after gaining the perks you are somewhat more powerful than you would be without the mod. Oh yeah, I&#39;m pretty sure this will affect enemy mages with the perks too, so they may be a little more difficult as well. There are ways around that I&#39;m sure, but I think that it is fair that they be a little more powerful too. I made this mod because even though there are mods that change these kinds of things, they also tend to change many more aspects of the magic system. I just wanted a simple mod, so I would not be changing the magic gameplay drastically. \r<br />\r<br />================\r<br />Specific Changes\r<br />================\r<br />\r<br />- Magic Regeneration during Combat Multiplier (fCombatMagickaRegenRateMult) was increased from 33% to 65%.\r<br />\r<br />- Augmented Flames, Augmented Frost, and Augmented Shock perk&#39;s rank 1 increased from 25% damage increase to 35% and rank 2 was increased from 50% to 70%.\r<br />\r<br />==============\r<br />Version History\r<br />==============\r<br />\r<br />v1.0 - initial release\r<br />\r<br />=============\r<br />Contacting Me\r<br />=============\r<br />\r<br />If you have any suggetions or problems with the mod you can message me on the Nexus sites, and I will try to reply as soon as I can.",
