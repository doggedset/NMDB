  "descriptionHtml": "As is said in the disclaimer above with is Racemenu for SSE. This is nothing more than a guy wanting to help out others who have no idea on how to make Racemenu into the SSE format. Again I am not the maker of ANY of these files, I just packed everything to work in SSE. DO NOT SUPPORT ME FOR THIS, GO SUPPORT - expired6978 - FOR THIS IS THEIR WORK NOT MINE! Once expired6978 makes a official file I will not be making these uploads at all. This is for people who either do not want to make racemenu from Oldrim into something compatible for SSE or just do not know how.",
