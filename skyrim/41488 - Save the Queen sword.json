  "descriptionHtml": "** Save the Queen - Version 2.0 **\r<br />Add to the mod is an alternative version of the sword.  The textures are all \r<br />reworked in attempt to make the metal of the sword more realistic.  New decals \r<br />were added as well.  And a leather grip added to the hilt.  Alternative versions \r<br />of the new sword include one without the decals, and one sword with a \r<br />transparent/refracting blade (though its labeled &#34;mystical,&#34; no enchantment is \r<br />made).  Enjoy&#33;\r<br />\r<br />===================================================================\r<br />\r<br />** Save the Queen - Version 1.0 **\r<br />\r<br />-- ABOUT --\r<br />This started out as a basic replica of the Save the Queen sword from the Final Fantasy (XII) universe.  But as I worked on the sword, I wondered if &#34;Save the Queen&#34; could find some localized lore.  Then it came to me.  Why not a sword commissioned by Elisif the Fair, Jarl of Solitude--and likely the High Queen of all Skyrim once order was restored in the realm.\r<br />\r<br />So that&#39;s my story behind it.  It&#39;s up to the players to decide if they accept it or not.  Do you want to fight for the honor of the future High Queen?  Or is it just another sword you want to lop heads off with?  You decide&#33;\r<br />\r<br />You can get these either by crafting at a forge (category steel, but no steel smithing perk required), or using the omnipotent power of the command console.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-- WHAT&#39;S INCLUDED --\r<br />[Save the Queen] - Two-Handed great sword with gold accents.\r<br />[Save the Queen - Black] - Two-Handed great sword with black (no) accents.\r<br />[Save the Queen - Silver] - Two-Handed great sword with silver accents.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />-- KNOWN ISSUES --\r<br />None that I&#39;m aware of.\r<br />\r<br />-- ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS --\r<br />.
