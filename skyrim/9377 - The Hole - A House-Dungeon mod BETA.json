  "descriptionHtml": "WARNING: This mod is altogether a test mod, and although it is playable, it was made\r\nonly as a method to test out my footing with the ck.\r\nIt is fully playable, and contains all necessary functionality, but the last room \r\nwill probably never be finished. I\\'m discontinuing work on this mod for now in favor\r\nof another mod, which probably won\\'t knock your lore senseless and\r\nbeat it up while you watch.\r\nThat, though, won\\'t stop it from having an underground sacred treehouse cave with\r\nDwemer architecture, traps, puzzles, vendors, guards AND a /realistic/ story all under a lake.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdds a Trapdoor by the boss sarcophagus in Hamvir\\'s Rest,\r\nwhich leads to a house with all the basic amenities plus:\r\n\r\nV0.2\r\n# Added some dialogue\r\n# A quest to retrieve a truly Swordly sword.\r\n# More bad puns and innuendo\r\n# Imma Firin Mah LazorBuddha  Statue\r\n# More plants in garden\r\n# Some fixes\r\n# Added Navmesh for the tunnel leading to the Dungeon\r\n Draugr will now enter the tunnel, but not the antechamber, \\'cos then\r\n you\\'d have no place to hide.\r\n\r\n___________________________________________________\r\n# A geothermal smithing garden cavern  *Yes, I\\'m Crazy*\r\n# A Dungeon that I will continually expand and update.\r\n# A pet baby troll that contemplates philosophy while staring at a fire.\r\n# A dude.\r\n# A large amount of love.\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n# Typos do exist\r\n# The fights may be too hard or too easy based on circumstances\r\n# If you beat the Draugr at a low level, the loot will probably be overlevelled for you,\r\n# Dialogue might be a bit fast, the whole \\\"record some silence\\\" thing won\\'t work for me.\r\n# Lizzie might occasionally stop attacking you until you fight back. She\\'s like that.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nI recommend the Nexus Mod Manager, but if that\\'s not your thing, \r\njust extract into your Data folder. \r\n\r\nConflicts:\r\nAny thing that adds a trapdoor next to the main sarcophagus in Hamvir\\'s rest. Oh, the horror.\r\n\r\nRead the book on the table in the main room to learn more.\r\nTy!",
