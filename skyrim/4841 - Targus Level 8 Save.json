  "descriptionHtml": "[This is my first upload, it\\'s only a save i know, but i\\'m still learing how to mod :P]\r\n\r\nTargus is a straight-forward level 8 Warrior, nothing really special here, but there\\'s a list of items that he has in his inventory straight from the start.\r\n\r\nThe starting tutorial quest \\\"Unbound\\\" has been finished, and i\\'ve already talked to Gurdur in Riverwood, so you can go straight to the Jarl of Whiterun or go explore!\r\n\r\nCurrently located at the three [3] guardian stones and you have equipment for a thief, mage and warrior at your disposal as shown below.\r\n\r\nList of items;\r\n\r\nWeapons\r\n1x Hunting Bow (And 150 Iron Arrows)\r\n2x Iron Dagger\r\n2x Iron Sword\r\n1x Iron Greatsword\r\n2x Staff of Flames\r\n1x Notched Pickaxe\r\n1x Poacher\\'s Axe\r\n\r\n\r\nArmor\r\n1x Fur Armor Set (Armor, boots, gloves & helm)\r\n1x Iron Armor Set (Armor, boots, gloves & helm)\r\n1x Robes of Destruction (15% reduction in destruction magicka use & +50% magicka egeneration)\r\n1x Silver Necklace\r\n1x Silver Ring\r\n1x Hide Shield\r\n1x Banded Iron Shield\r\n\r\n\r\nPotions & Poisons\r\n25x Potion of Minor Healing\r\n25x Potion of Minor Magicka\r\n25x Potion of Minor Stamina\r\n10x Weak Paralysis Poison\r\n10x Weak Magicka Poison\r\n10x Weak Stamina Poison\r\n10x Weak Poison [Health Damage]\r\n\r\n\r\nCrafting Materials\r\n5x Deer Hide\r\n5x Wolf Pelt\r\n15x Leather\r\n15x Leather Strips\r\n15x Iron Ore\r\n15x Iron Ingot\r\n15x Blue Butterfly Wing\r\n15x Blue Mountain Flower\r\n15x Red Mountain Flower\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous Items\r\n100x Lockpick\r\n375x Gold\r\n1x Knee Notice\r\n\r\nOther Stuff\r\nMost enchants learned & most alchemy ingredients have all four [4] properties revealed.  I\\'ve also added ALL perks, except bribery under the speech tree.\r\n\r\nAll these items are in their most basic form, each one is lootable (Except the Psiijic stuff) and NOT enchanted in any way, shape or form.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s not really a mod so do whatever you want with it, just don\\'t accidentally delete it.\r\n\r\nFeedback always welcome.\r\n\r\n[Also, as a little treat, i\\'ve added the Psiijic set too for those that want some good mage robes, it includes the robes, hood, & gloves]\r\n\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\n17:19 GMT - As requested by a commenter i\\'ve decided to add another save without the added perks and enchant/alchemy discoveries, for a more, legitimate game.  Found the Psiijic boots too.  This will be in a SEPERATE file, the first one is as the description above describes.\r\n\r\nThe second file (Targus Level 1) will have all the same items, but not all the perks or enchant/alchemy discoveries.  So make your choice.\r\n\r\nYour carrying capacity will be at 299/300, so pick what you want to play, and sell whatever is left over at the Riverwood Trader in Riverwood, i\\'d suggest keeping hold of the Psiijic equipment, and the notched pickaxe & poacher\\'s axe, since they\\'re hard to get a hold of.\r\n\r\n17:32 GMT - Uploaded \\\"Targus Level 1 Save\\\" which has no perks or enchant/alchemy discoveries.  Enjoy.",
