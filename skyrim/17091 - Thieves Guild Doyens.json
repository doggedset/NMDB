They are not quest givers.  \r\nThey are, however, a way for the player to remove all bounties for half price.  \r\nYou must belong to the Thieve\\'s Guild to use their services.  \r\n\r\nDag the Knacker can be found in Markarth in the Silver-Blood Inn\r\nRaw-Rube Ruby is in the Ragged Flagon in Riften.  \r\nLatra Casta is in the Bannered Mare in Whiterun.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n4: Installation / Uninstallation\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n\r\nMerge the data file from the mod with the one in your Skyrim folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\n\r\nRemove the files that came with the mod.\r\nAn easy way to do this would be to copy, (not cut),\r\nthe files into the folder a second time, and overwrite everything.\r\nNow hit undo.\r\nAssuming you\\'re using windows this will delete the necessary files.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n5: Version History / Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n.91:\r\n\r\n1. The npcs are now scripted to move out of their starting cell.\r\n\r\n   They stopped doing as of some Beth. patch or another.  \r\n\r\n2. Exported FaceGen data as there faces had acquired gray/black.\r\n\r\n3. Removed update.esm as a master with TES5Edit.  \r\n\r\n   I had unintentionally added it while working on the above stuff.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n.915:\r\n\r\n1. Included the mesh files for the facegen data.  \r\n\r\n   .91 only had the textures so you were probably still getting black face issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n6: Incompatibilities / Known Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have a high bounty in the same city where you paid a doyen, \r\nthe guards may still pursue you until you\\'ve fast traveled away and back.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n7: Legal\r\n\r\n \r\nI don\\'t care what is done with any of the parts of this, \r\nbut you must follow the rules set by Bethesda and/or wherever you upload the file. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
