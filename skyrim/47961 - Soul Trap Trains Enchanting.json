  "summary": "Successfully trapping a soul will train your enchanting skill as effectively as recharging your items. An alternative to enchant-grinding.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Credit goes to [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/8223920]CookieDynamics[/url] for the idea.\r<br />\r<br />This is an alteration to the Soul Trap script so that when you trap a soul (meaning, if the animation plays and you get the &#34;Soul Trapped&#33;&#34; notification), then you will gain experience in Enchanting. The experience gained will be equal to what it will be if you later use that soul gem for recharging a weapon. This means trapping grand souls is a lot more productive than trapping petty souls.\r<br />\r<br />This is not compatible with anything that modifies the Soul Trap script. That means Acquisitive Soul Gems. If you want this compatibility, you might consider using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54415/?]Soul Trap Redone[/url] by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/12378724]hc65535[/url], instead. After requests from myself and others, this feature was added to it, and it also has features to serve as an alternative to Acquisitive Soul Gems. The base for the code to accomplish this was provided directly by me (before being modified), so if this mod works for you, that one should as well (as far as Enchanting experience is concerned), and it, like mine, will grant varied experience based on the soul&#39;s size.\r<br />\r<br />Change 1.0-1.5: Added MCM menu\r<br />Change 0.1-1.0: Found the incompatibility was USKP. Only solution seemed to be making it a master file. USKP is now required.",
