  "descriptionHtml": "If you don&#39;t plan on using your dagger for sneak attacks but still enjoy fighting with it, most of the time you&#39;re going to be very outclassed by better weapons. \r<br />\r<br />Daggers only get 30% more attack speed than swords, but at lower levels the dagger has barely over half their base damage. This is nowhere near enough compensation, but even if the damage factor was properly reduced according to the increased attack speed, the range of the dagger is much less than the sword. This is all disregarding the fact that anyone who has tried 5 minutes of melee combat knows that you probably aren&#39;t going to get many strikes in at a time making the huge increase in attack speed barely worth it.\r<br />\r<br />This mod changed the scaling factor for daggers for each Armsman perk while keeping the 0/20/40/60/80/100% for swords, maces, and war axes constant.. Each individual perk has a different amount of extra dagger damage to maintain balance as the game progresses.",
