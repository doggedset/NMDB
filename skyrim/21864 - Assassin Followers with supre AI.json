  "summary": "New assassin followers with immense combat AI improvement (I mean, REALLY smart). How much smart? As smart as actual players (Not OP. Very balanced stats).\r\n\r\nMinimal energy: zero performance hit.\r\nNo other mod required. Works with any other mod you have.\r\n\r\n",
  "descriptionHtml": "Note- this is a video for an old version.  Current version is MUCH smarter and MUCH more balanced.\r\n[youtube]EM_TJbUlDcM[/youtube]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNewly Added NPC\r\nThree new followers whom are all belong to Dark Brotherhood\r\nHigh Elf, Dark Elf and Breton Females\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe background stories for the followers ;\r\n\r\nOur three assassins, as it turns out are Dark Brotherhood initiates. On the day our hero was found captured and enroute to Helgan for execution as the game opens. They were assigned to target one of the ThalmorAdvisors (unusual for initiates), but the three highly trained initiates were given the target assignment just the same. As they moved closer to their target, the Thalmor Warrior Guards discovered them and were about to move in to apprehend them.\r\n \r\nThey were nearly captured if it weren\\'t for Dovahkiin and the distracting diversion he caused to enable their escape. Seeing a thiefsteeling a horse, thinking quickly, he was able to divert the guards\\' attentionto the horse thief. The thief rode swiftly but ran into the small Stormcloakentourage with Ulfric himself with them, the Thalmor Warriors right behind. All were arrested asspies and collaborators for the Stormcloaks.\r\n \r\nAnd so our story opens with Ulfric, the Stormcloak Patrol,the horse thief and our hero enroute to Helgen for swift punishment at theHeadsman\\'s Axe. However, our three beautiful assassins killed the Justiciar while the accompanying Thalmor Warriors were distracted. And now you have the opportunity to team TheDragonborn up with these deadly assassins who are more than willing to follow and fight for him and for you.\r\n\r\nWritten by LavaHawaii\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAI Improvement\r\n\r\nNewly created class and combat data specifically for assassin type followers to perform better.\r\n\r\nNewly created Perks and spells for assassin characters to perform better.\r\n\r\nMulty targetting enabled: seeking for the weakiest enemy instead of chasing one target forever.\r\n\r\nUse of range/melee weapons under the correct situations.\r\n\r\nImproved path finding during combat. (Not getting stuck somewhere and being so stupid.)\r\n\r\nUse of backstabbing when possible.\r\n\r\nActive use of Invisibility under the correct situations, such as:\r\n\r\n1: when AI determinds that the assassin followers are getting too much attention from enemeies and must reduce threat from the enemies.\r\n\r\n2: when AI determinds that the assassin followers are capable of getting close to enemeies with invisibility.\r\n\r\n3: when AI determinds that the enemeies are using ranged magic/weapons and the assassin followers must get close to them without getting detected/attacked.\r\n\r\n4: when AI determinds the assassin followers are getting out-threatend by too many enemies. (When this AI triggers, the assassin followers cast invisibility and run away for a bit and attack again.\r\n\r\n5: when AI determinds it is necessary to cast invisibility under many other situations.\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nMinimal energet (No slowing down your game.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLevel\r\nAll three of them are starting at level 5, and will not use invisibility very often up until level 25. Once they become level 25, they will be performing in the way that you can see on my video. Their max level is 81.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerk\r\n\r\n\\\"By The Shadow\\\" -  Having 15% chance of transforming into a ghost form that avoids all attacks for 3 seconds when getting hit,\r\n\\\"For The Shadow\\\" - Having a higher chance of dealing critical damage when attacking while not beeing detected, \r\n\\\"To The Shadow\\\" - Armor bonus. This however, only works when wearing Light armor, boots and gloves.\r\n\\\"The Fear\\\" - Cast Rout to get out of trouble in combat.\r\n\\\"NPC Version of Shadow Warrior\\\" - having a chance to stop combat for a moment and forces distant opponents to search for a target\r\n\\\"Preperation\\\" - When attacking with one handed weapones, having 15% chance of paralizing enemeis.\r\n\\\"Blink\\\" - A visual effect to dodge melee attacks\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd many other perks such as \\\"Silence\\\", \\\"Stealth\\\", \\\"Light foot\\\", \\\"Quiet casting\\\", \\\"Muffled movement\\\" etc etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe location for the followers: Dawnstar Inn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecommanded\r\nAny other mod you want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompability\r\nWorks with all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequired mod\r\nNone\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n\r\nBethesda\r\nCreation Kit\r\nNPC Editor\r\nHair Pack\r\nEasy NPC Creat Tool\r\n\\\"LavaHawaii\\\" for story writings.\r\n\r\n",
