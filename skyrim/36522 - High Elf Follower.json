  "descriptionHtml": "Cassandra or Clare for short, is a willing female high elf follower. She comes with dragonscale armour (it may or may not be red), 2 daedric swords, and a daedric dagger. She is slightly tall, and is a mage, if you want a different combat style just tell me and I will make her with a new combat style. She can be easily found in the Four-Shield Tavern in Dragon Bridge which is between Solitude and Markarth for those of you who don\\'t know. There aren\\'t any known bugs, if you find one tell me and I will try and fix it for you. This is my first mod so I am sorry for any weird mishaps. Thank you for checking out my mod! If somebody wants a different race of gender contact me.",
