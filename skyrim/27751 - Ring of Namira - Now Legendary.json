  "summary": "Modifies the Ring of Namira enchantment to be more suited to that of an artifact created by a powerful lord.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I know I\\'m not the only one who thought the vanilla Ring of Namira was a bit wimpy for being forged by the Lady of Decay - there are several other mods on the nexus that modify Daedric Artifacts.  But none of them suited my needs for my current character so I made one of my own.\r\n\r\nThis mod changes the base fortify stamina value to 300.  It also changes the effects you get from feeding on a corpse.  Now you get a 150% increase to your health and stamina regen (but no added fortify effect) for 13 days.\r\n\r\nFuture updates:\r\nI want to add an additional effect to feeding that makes the character unable to heal from restoration spells, potions, or food for 13 days to balance things out a bit.  If anyone knows how to do this, please let me know and I\\'ll add you on as a full author.",
