  "descriptionHtml": "I started this mod long time ago and a few days ago when I was playing skyrim it started to crash in skyrim, when in akavir areas it works well, when I disable akavir mod it worked well too.So before I continue with this mod I would like you guys to test it, if your game crash because of it I might stop working on this if the majority of you says it work fine I will continue,it´s still not finnished, most of the areas are but the tang mo forest is not.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds akavir areas imagined by me, I have no skill at quests but since this acts as linear levels the story is basically the Ka po tuns are trying to release tosh raka (a ka po tun that managed to turn into a dragon according o lore) from a temple where he was imprisoned by tang mo, so this journey takes you to different enviroments from mountains to underwater.\r\n\r\nTo enter akavir go through a hole behind whiterun blacksmith house (this is just temporary I will remove it and make proper transportation.\r\n\r\n\r\nREAD: This mod is stopped and I don´t really know when will I get back to it, I work as long as I´m inspired but even so I have real life to deal with and little time for gaming so anyone who wishes to continue or use this as a resources feel free to do so :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[youtube]Nb7ggx4Ayfo[/youtube]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nExoshinoizme - for the preview video\r\nMuppetpuppet - tiger textures and flora resources and for helping me converting the jungle sounds(http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9782)\r\nDoodaboom - scout armor (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7109)\r\nDogtown ad CDproject - creatures (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=9694)\r\nChickenDownUnder - Bamboo plant  (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15108)\r\nInsanitySorrow - celtic katanas  (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15389)\r\nKomoni - dark brotherhood robe set  (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6271)\r\nImsumdave - Black sting  (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13675)",
