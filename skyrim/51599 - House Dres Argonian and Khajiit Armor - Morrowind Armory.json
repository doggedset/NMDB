They&#39;re mostly in charge of Dunmer agriculture, and they represent the past of pre-Tribunal Great House culture, a persistent tradition of Daedra- and ancestor-worshipping civilized Dunmer clans. Since the fall of the tribunal, this culture has spread back to the other houses. \r<br />\r<br />Requires elven smithing and can be made under the leather category. \r<br />\r<br />This requires the Dragonborn DLC. The game should crash on startup if you don&#39;t have it. ",
