  "modName": "Moar Arrows",
  "summary": "This mod adds recipes for the arrows, and some new elemental arrows ",
  "descriptionHtml": "In this mod you will find that each arrow can be crafted if you have the perk for it. As I was doing this for personal gain I thought why not. So I thought I\\'d  add a few elemental arrows just for the fun of it, and after awhile of thinking about it I decided to poke around at the elemental arrow idea. And I came up with lots of brand new arrows that hopefully later one will have there own texture/model. Theses arrows are Fireball arrow that explode with a nice big ball of fire, Lighting Arrow you always gata have something that\\'s shocking, and my personal favorite is the Earthquake arrow, Yah that\\'s right AN EARTHQUAKE ARROW you can shoot it at the floor to knock your enemies down for a quick escape or just need some space to heal, And last but not least A frost arrow that will send pieces of Ice everywhere. Causing damage to thous around them. \r\n\r\nUpdates:\r\n1.2 Added A holy arrow that does damage to the undead, and A Magelight arrow.\r\n1.4 Added A Merchant to whiterun that carries a 100 of each arrow, and other archery supplies\r\n1.6 Added A beta test poison arrow and 2 more merchants one in solitude and in riften.. (will post pictures soon)\r\n1.8 An hopefull fix to the Poison arrow, and added the WABBAJACK Arrow... (I had fun testing this...)\r\n1.8.5 Fixed a small bug in the Wabbajack arrow where sometimes the arrow wouldn\\'t register the explosion \r\n\r\nNOTES: \r\nYes you have to be at the skyforge for the NordHero arrows...\r\nDon\\'t forget to comment if you have any ideas.\r\n\r\nQuestions: \r\n1) Why is the mod not working? \r\n     A) check if its turned on...?\r\n\r\n2) Does the holy arrow hurt the living too....\r\n     A) Yes because everything is skyrim is slightly evil :P \r\n\r\n3) Do you wana help me with this mod?\r\n    A) Just send me a message, FYI I need some to do textures :3 I got the models I need just not a very good texture artist...\r\n\r\n",
