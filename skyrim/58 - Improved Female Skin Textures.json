  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5]\r\n[color=lightblue]Improved Female Skin Textures (by Volek)[/color][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\nI started improving some face textures for a friend and i think they ended up pretty well so i continued and improved all female face and body textures (excluding Argonians and Khajiits). All textures are uncompressed, to enhance quality.\r\n\r\n[color=lightblue]What i did:[/color]\r\n* removed blocky look from body and faces (including eyes, ears, lips, and hands)\r\n* reduced brow ridge of female Dunmer face\r\n* removed wrinkles from Dunmer and Breton faces (so you don\\'t have to play an old woman)\r\n* removed shades from face texture that looked like a moustache\r\n* reduced dirt on body and hand textures\r\n* reduced specular map of body (i think it looks better, but it\\'s a matter of taste. If you don\\'t like the specular map, delete Data\\\\textures\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\female\\\\femalebody_1_s.dds)\r\n\r\n[color=lightblue]How to install:[/color]\r\n* Locate your Skyrim folder, default is C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim or C:\\\\ProgramFiles(x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\r\n* Open the zip file, extract the Data folder to your Skyrim folder \r\n\r\nSome people encountered a black body bug, if you find out what causes it, please write a comment or PM.\r\n\r\nIf you wanna use the textures in your mod, just give credit, no need to ask for permission.",
