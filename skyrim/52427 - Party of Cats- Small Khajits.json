  "descriptionHtml": "[b][color=#e06666]*This mod is abandoned for now, the laggy Creation Kit requires patience and dedication of a saint, however, I still like the idea of this mod, so if you&#39;re a Skyrim modder, please try to keep the Party of Cat dream alive, I would love to one day log in and play as a real life sized cat, that would be hilarious, love yall&#34;[/color]\r<br />[/b]\r<br />[color=#f9cb9c]Party of Cats will be my project to make Khajits cute and all about co-operation with other Khajits. They travel together in caravans, so it only makes sense that they explore dungeons together&#33;\r<br />[/color]\r<br />What does this mod do?\r<br />It makes all Khajit slightly smaller than childern (Puss-in-Boots hehe).\r<br />I also changed their racial skills because Khajit are too goodhearted to be pickpockets & lock picks. Khajit talk of warm sands is very soothing and calming and as a result they gain +10 restoration and +10 speech as their main skills. Their subskills are +5 to block, destruction & sneak for a balanced Party of Cats.\r<br />Khajit now also have 40 starting health but 60 magicka & stamina. Because they can&#39;t take as much hits due to their size, but they are very energetic.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#93c47d]The perfect Party of Cats like the one in the main picture, is for main character to be a Khajit healer or archer. Then recruit Jzargo (destruction mage) & Kharjo (tank warrior).[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Some mods for Party of Cats:\r<br />[color=#6d9eeb]Multiple Followers (Party of 3 Cats) \r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31581/?\r<br />\r<br />Pounce n Dash (reduced racial height means, less movespeed and jump height, while I like slow move speed the jump has to be improved, cats can jump high&#33;)\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31424/?[/color]",
