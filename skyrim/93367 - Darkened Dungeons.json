  "summary": "Makes dungeons darker. But not pitch black.  Script-free &amp; lightweight.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b]What does this do?\n<br />\n<br />[/b]It makes dungeons darker and more atmospheric. DLC dungeons are included as well.\n<br />\n<br />&gt; Shadow casting lights will look more impressive and scenic\n<br />&gt; It does not make dungeons pitch black. \n<br />&gt; Torches will be more useful now.\n<br />\n<br />Look at the screenshots for examples.\n<br />\n<br />[b]How does it do it?\n<br />\n<br />[/b]By editing the vanilla lightning templates/presets and simply making the basic ambient light darker.  \n<br />\n<br />&gt; The basic dungeon imagespace has been made slightly darker as well. \n<br />&gt; The dungeons themselves are untouched  and unedited = I haven't deleted any candles or torches, I haven't moved around any objects etc. \n<br />&gt; There should be 0 impact on fps/performance. \n<br />&gt; There are no scripts added by this mod.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compability\n<br />\n<br />[/b]As mentioned above, this mod only affects the light templates and one default dungeon imagespace. If another mod edits this things as well there's gonna be a conflict. Not a ctd conflict, but one mod will overwrite the other. Everything else should be fine.\n<br />\n<br />No, I don't have a list of which mods are compatible or not.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Good to know[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Check the video tab for a comparison video by Chaodynn. Compares: Vanilla vs Darkened vs Darkened + ELFX.\n<br />\n<br />Some dungeons might not use the templates. Or only use part of the templates.[u] If you find a dungeon that is still too bright, post a comment and I'll sort it out. [/u]\n<br />I haven't had time to test every dungeon in game yet.\n<br />\n<br />If you have any modded dungeons that uses vanilla lightning templates they will be darkened as well.\n<br />\n<br />Draugr enjoy relaxing with cozy candlelights and a good book.",
