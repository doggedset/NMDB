  "descriptionHtml": "Darker Dragonbone Weapons\r<br />\r<br />This mod is a simple retexture for the vanilla Dragonbone weapons. \r<br />Have you ever felt like the vanilla Dragonbone weapons introduced in the Dawnguard expansion didn&#39;t fit very well with your Daedric-clad tank characters, assassins, or &#34;evil&#34; mage characters?\r<br />This was a quick attempt by yours truly to rectify that problem. \r<br />I&#39;ve sharpened the default textures, gray-scaled them, and tweaked the brightness in order to change the default white/brown textures into something more gray/black, while still retaining much of their original overall appearance. \r<br />\r<br />Compatibility: Requires Dawnguard, should be compatible with any mods that don&#39;t alter the Dragonbone weapons. \r<br />\r<br />Issues: None that I can think of. \r<br />\r<br />Installation: Just unzip into your data folder and you should be good to go. \r<br />\r<br />Please remember to endorse if you like the mod&#33;\r<br />\r<br />You might also want to check out my various enchantment mods:\r<br />\r<br />New Day Rising - Enchantments of the Paladins\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/47988\r<br />\r<br />Black Against Night - Enchantments for the Discerning Adventurer\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/41255\r<br />\r<br />From the Ashes - Lost Enchantments of the Sixth House\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/45652\r<br />\r<br />Queen of the Damned - Deadlier Serana\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49465",
