Three of versions of Saber (Saber, Saber Alter, Saber Lily) appeared in the Fate/unlimited codes. Saber (???? Seib??) is a fictional character from the Japanese visual novel and anime series Fate/stay night by TYPE-MOON and its prequel, Fate/zero by TYPE-MOON and nitroplus.\r\n\r\nSaber Lily is an alternate version of Saber featured in Fate/unlimited codes as an unlockable alternate costume. She was designed by Takashi Takeuchi as another form of the King of Knights with an \\\"emphasis on her girlishness.\\\" In contrast to the blackened Saber Alter, she is called the pure and sweet \\\"Princess of Knights\\\" who is shown to carry Caliburn rather than Excalibur. Her design was inspired by the dress Caster placed on Saber after she was captured during Unlimited Blade Works. The design was filled with the feminine qualities that Saber lacks, and \\\"Lily\\\" in her name refers to her skirt being designed to resemble the petals of a lily flower. She has no background information within unlimited codes or other side materials, but Nasu Kinoko and Gen Urobuchi joke about her being a version of Saber fully tamed by Caster during a discussion. She has appeared in a number of promotional images with Saber, Saber Alter, and Red Saber. \r\n\r\n[img]http://www5.picturepush.com/photo/a/5495438/1024/Picture-Box/Fate-Stay-Night-Saber-Lily-01.png[/img][/center]\r\n[color=Grey][center]Files provided here is simply for fans (my self included) works for \\\"Saber Lily character\\'s outfit\\\" from Fate series .\r\nAs the original mod creator \\\"Norakuro\\\" isn\\'t prohibite for modification and has given permission for the files.
