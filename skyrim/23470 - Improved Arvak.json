  "descriptionHtml": "- Improved Arvak v1.0 -\r\n\r\n\r\n== If you enjoy this file please don\\'t forget to endorse it! ==\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE LOG\r\n============ \r\n- v1.0 (September 1, 2012) Original release\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n============\r\nImproved Arvak does three things:\r\n\r\n 1) Sets the casting cost of the \\\"Summon Arvak\\\" spell to 0.\r\n\r\n 2) Increases Arvak\\'s speed by 50%\r\n\r\n 3) Increases Arvak\\'s stamina by 100.\r\n\r\nArvak, the summonable skeletal horse from the Dawnguard DLC, is an awesome addition to Skyrim. Not only does he have a unique look, but you can call on him anywhere. He is truly the best answer to the horse frustrations players have had since Oblivion.\r\n\r\nBut he isn\\'t perfect. Arvak has a low casting cost and is classified as a novice conjuration spell, but it\\'s still a little too pricey for non-casters. Whats more, even if you have the mana to cast the spell normally, you may often find yourself waiting around for enough mana to regen after each fight so you can ride off again. I don\\'t think that adds much to the experience.\r\n\r\nLike all horses in Skyrim, riding Arvak allows the player to travel faster than they could on foot. The frustrating part is that when Skyrim was designed, horse speeds were reduced to ensure that the player could not move faster than the consoles would be able to load in terrain and objects. I play on a PC, I don\\'t like to fast travel, and I want my horses to be useful.\r\n\r\nNormally, I use the awesome \\\"Better Horses\\\" mod by LtMattmoo, but so far it doesn\\'t look as though he\\'s been back to update his work for Dawnguard.\r\n\r\nImproved Arvak increases Arvak\\'s speed to 150, adds a stamina offset of 100, and reduces the casting cost of the \\\"Summon Arvak\\\" spell to 0. Enjoy!\r\n\t\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n============\r\nWhile I recommend using NMM, this is a simple ESP with no hidden tricks. You can always just drop \\\"Improved Arvak.esp\\\" into your data folder. To uninstall, remove that file.\r\n\r\nImproved Arvak will conflict with any other mod that alters the Arvak horse or spell.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTACT\r\n============\r\nIf you have any questions about or suggestions for Improved Arvak, feel free to email the author at emberwake@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICENSING\r\n============\r\nFeel free to reuse or repackage this mod for your own work. I only ask that credit me if you do so.",
