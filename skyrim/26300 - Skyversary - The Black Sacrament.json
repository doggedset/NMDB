  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5][color=#B690DE][b]The UESP Forums Skyversary presents: The Black Sacrament[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />Thirty-five members of the UESP Forums have volunteered to let you (virtually) hunt them down, kill them, and take their stuff.  Be ready for some challenging fights&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The player will automatically have a Black Sacrament Dossier in their possession, which should guide them to these new NPCs.\r<br />\r<br />If you don&#39;t know what the UESP forums are, visit [url=http://forums.uesp.net/index.php]http://forums.uesp.net/index.php[/url] to check us out&#33;  It&#39;s the forum side of the popular Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages.  If you aren&#39;t familiar with the folks on that forum, this mod may not be very interesting to you, but there are several nice new items (some with unique appearances) to be found even if the names mean nothing to you.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#B690DE][b]Installation Instructions[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />If you&#39;re installing this by hand, then extract all files into Skyrim&#39;s Data folder (for me, that&#39;s under C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;skyrim&#92;Data). If you already have existing meshes and textures folders, click Yes or Yes to All when it prompts you whether you want to copy the files into them.\r<br />\r<br />Once you unpack the files, verify that the mod is activated by selecting &#34;Data Files&#34; from the loader screen, and ensuring that &#34;UESP Skyversary NPCs.esp&#34; is checked.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#B690DE][b]Credits[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />This mod was created by Deandra at the UESP (username Merilia at TESNexus since the name Deandra was taken).  All new resources may be used in a mod of your own, but you must credit me for my work.  The cloaks are used with permission from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12092]Cloaks of Skyrim[/url].  The pumpkins are from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22018]New Plants 1_1[/url] by Tamira, from a model originally by Yughues aka Nobiax.
