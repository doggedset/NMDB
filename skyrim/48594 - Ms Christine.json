  "descriptionHtml": "Ms. Christine is my second cougar with different armor, made off of the sexy base model of Sylja the miners daughter.  Same sword with same kickass enchants. New armor I found in the creation kit.  No I did not rip it off from another mod on Nexus,  if I used another Nexus mod in my mod I would tell you and give the author props. She is still marriable and will give u gifts like the first coug.  Let me know what u think",
