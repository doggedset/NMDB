The Huntsman is no ordinary bow, aside from it&#39;s Unique appearance it has the option of being Upgraded with Upgrade Kits that not only change the stats but also change the appearance. The Huntsman also levels up with the player so it should never become useless.\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Finding The Huntsman:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />Your hunt begins in a Bleak Barrow.\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Upgrading The Huntsman:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />Upgrading the Huntsman is one of it&#39;s main Features, the upgrades are found throughout the world, well Interior cells anyway. You&#39;ll notice they come in the form of Upgrade Kits (Boxes) and are placed in easily to spot locations.\r<br />\r<br />To upgrade you either activate the Kit where they are placed, if you are able you can upgrade on the spot, if not later on when you want to upgrade drop the Kit and activate it, you&#39;ll be given the option to upgrade.\r<br />\r<br />Available Upgrades:\r<br />\r<br />[list][*]Grip Wrapping[/*]\r<br />[*]Stabilizer[/*]\r<br />[*]Sights[/*]\r<br />[*]Quiver[/*]\r<br />[*]Reinforced Limbs[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />Each of the Upgrades has a visual change along with a stat change, though what these are you&#39;ll have to find out for yourself.\r<br />\r<br />The Upgrades must be applied in the order listed above.\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Painting The Huntsman:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />Painting Patterns are an option available for those that wish to personalize the Huntsman. To do so players have to purchase paint bottles\r<br />from Merchants, these are Misc items. The player must then drop the paint bottle and activate it, once activated the player will have the option of either\r<br />painting the Huntsman or not if they decide not too.\r<br />\r<br />Due to the way the game works you must UnEquip and then re-Equip the Huntsman for the First Person changes to take affect.\r<br />\r<br />Upgrading the Huntsman resets the paint choice back to it&#39;s default setting.\r<br />\r<br />Paints can be purchased from your local Blacksmith or Trader.\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Installation\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />[list=1][*]Extract the contents of the ZIP folder into your Data folder[/*]\r<br />[*]Make sure the The Huntsman.esp is checked in the Launcher[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />=================\r<br />Un-Installation:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />[list=1][*]Delete the files/folders associated with the mod[/*]\r<br />[*]Uncheck the The Huntsman.esp is checked in the Launcher[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />=================\r<br />Known Issues/Incompatibilities:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />None so Far.\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Contact:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />InsanitySorrow @ TES Alliance\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Credits:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />Licensing/Legal:\r<br />=================\r<br />\r<br />You may use this as you wish as long as you don&#39;t charge money for it and you credit me for any work used.\r<br />\r<br />Please do not re-host this file without my explicit permission. \r<br />\r<br />==================\r<br />Modder&#39;s Will:\r<br />==================\r<br />\r<br />If I am offline for six months or longer and do not respond to any attempts made at contacting me, I give full Ownership of my Projects to TES Alliance.\r<br />\r<br />TES Alliance are free to modify/redistribute/remove as they see fit.",
