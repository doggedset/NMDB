  "descriptionHtml": "When the tenth and mightiest of all gods, Bethestoros descended upon Tamriel, it seemed to him, that the world lacked two particular swords. This was of course Caliburn, the sword with the power to make someone King of England and Excalibur the Replacement for the broken Caliburn. But because he was really hungover from a party at that time, he messed up and forgot the magical powers of the swords. To fix this mistake, was my life task, which I fulfilled after many years of suffering and failure. I present you Excalibur and Caliburn, this time with magical powers, better stats and a name.\r\n\r\nBasically the mod replaces the two swords of the King Arthur references (Lady of the Lake, Sword in the Stone) with two modified steel sword.\r\n\r\nStats Caliburn:\r\n-12 Damage (a steel sword has 8)\r\n-remaining stats are the same as a normal steel sword\r\n-turn undead enchantment (up to lvl. 13)\r\n-fire damage 10 points enchantment\r\n-special \\\"King of England\\\" Achievement (not really)\r\n-infinite charges\r\n\r\nStats Excalibur:\r\n-12 Damage (a steel sword has 8)\r\n-remaining stats are the same as a normal steel sword\r\n-turn undead enchantment (up to lvl. 13)\r\n-paralysis (25%) for 2 seconds enchantment\r\n-infinite charges\r\n\r\nIf you think the stats should be different leave a suggestion in the comments.\r\n\r\nCAUTION:\r\nMay lead to execution of your character because of being a poor king (or queen) of England.\r\nMay lead to severe anxiety attacks if you are a vampire, a zombie or a skeleton.\r\n(If you sparkle in the sun you can ignore above warning)\r\nMay lead to burns or paralysis, if handled carelessly.\r\n\r\n*sorry for my bad english, it\\'s not my native language*\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\n-Bethesda for Skyrim and the Creation Kit\r\n-Bethestoros (not a reference at all) for this modding opportunity\r\n\r\nWall of Fame:\r\n-blazenite104 for enjoying my description\r\n-GensouSecret  for freshening up my background knowledge\r\n-Duskwitch for setting the price of my description to infinite (or nothing)\r\n-herpderp2332 for the first endorsement",
