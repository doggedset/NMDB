  "descriptionHtml": "I didn\\'t like the way that the Ancient Nord Swords, which are the most powerful weapons in the game looked. Yes they are \\\" Ancient \\\", but I don\\'t think that rusted swords would be that powerful, so I gave them a make-over!\r\n\r\nAll of the wooden handles / grips have been replaced with new flexible, polished ones. The metal has been totally redone and sharpened a few times and now the steel looks brand new!\r\n\r\nUPDATE: After Much Fiddling Around With Recolouring And Plug-Ins, I Finally Managed To Make Them Look Darker Without Ruining The Rest. Hope You Like :)\r\n\r\nRead The \\\" ReadMe! \\\" To See The Effects Used.\r\n\r\nFor My Other Files Look-Up \\\" Els236 \\\" In The Search Bar!\r\n\r\n",
