  "summary": "Normally, bumping into Sofia will make her play one of eight annoying lines. This mod gets rid of said lines.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3][b][font=Verdana][color=#ff0000]Description[/color][/font][/b]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54527/]Sofia[/url]﻿ is one of my favorite followers, but she can get very annoying if you let her. I turned off her idle dialogue in her MCM, but one thing I couldn't turn off was her bumping dialogue. So if you bumped into her, 9 times out of 10 she would comment on it. And she's constantly on your heels, so hearing these lines is inevitable. This mod takes those lines and silences them.\n<br />That's all there is to it. Now onto some questions I know will be asked.\n<br />\n<br />[b][font=Verdana][color=#ff0000]How do I install this mod?[/color][/font][/b]\n<br />If you're seriously asking this question, you should really read this [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/wiki/beginners_guide]Beginner's Guide to Skyrim Modding[/url]. It will make your modding experience much more enjoyable, and stable.\n<br />\n<br />[b][font=Verdana][color=#ff0000]Is this mod compatible with...?[/color][/font][/b]\n<br />This mod is just a sound replacer, it's compatible with everything.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Verdana][color=#ff0000][b]What exactly are the lines that this mod gets rid of?[/b][/color][/font]\n<br />These lines play whenever your character bumps into Sofia. The exact lines are:\n<br />\"Now, now. Calm yourself. I know I'm irresistible.\"\n<br />\"I know you're excited to see me but perhaps you should wait for a more appropriate moment before trying to dive on top of me.\"\n<br />\"You remind me of a dog I used to know. I had to always shake him off of me as well.\"\n<br />\"Most people usually buy me a drink first.\"\n<br />\"Wake up. Stop daydreaming about me and watch where you're going.\"\n<br />\"This isn't one of those boy meets girl clichés is it?\" (If your character is male)\n<br />\"Is this your idea of girl on girl action? ...What? I heard someone say it. I'm not even sure what it means.\" (If your character is female)\n<br />\"Oh, is there something hard in your pocket? I felt it when you brushed against me.\" (For some reason, this line is [i]not [/i]gender-dependent)\n<br />\n<br />[b][font=Verdana][color=#ff0000]Why do the subtitles for the lines still show even though they're not playing?[/color][/font][/b]\n<br />Unfortunately, getting rid of subtitles would require an .esp file. The subtitles are just a minor annoyance, nothing I'd sacrifice a plugin slot to get rid of.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Verdana][color=#ff0000][b]Do I need the \"Loose Files\" version of Sofia for this to work?[/b][/color][/font]\n<br />Yes, [i]unless[/i] you are using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334/]Mod Organizer[/url]﻿ (which I highly recommend you do) and are letting it handle .bsa files.\n<br />\n<br />[b][font=Verdana][color=#ff0000]Will this mod work if Sofia is part of a merged mod?[/color][/font][/b]\n<br />Yes! But you may have to go into my mod's files and rename the \"SofiaFollower.esp\" [b]folder[/b] to whatever your merged .esp file is named.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Verdana][color=#ff0000][b]I don't like Sofia.[/b][/color][/font]\n<br />Why are you here?[/size]",
