  "summary": "Are you tired of chaos in your weapon\\'s tab in invetory due to different arrow types scattered all over? This simple mode aims to solve the problem.",
  "descriptionHtml": "==Description==\r\nThere are many arrow types in skyrim - Iron Arrow, Ebony Arrow etc. Because of their unfortunate naming they appear in your inventory (which is sorted alphabetically) on different places. So I just changed their names so all of them starts with \\\"Arrow\\\" keeping them nicely on one place. This is a really simple modification but I believe it can be helpful nonetheless. \r\n\r\n==Installation==\r\nSimply put the .esp file into \\\"Data\\\" folder and then check it in game launcher or use the Nexus Mod Manager.\r\n\r\n==Rights==\r\nYou can do whatever you want with this mod",
