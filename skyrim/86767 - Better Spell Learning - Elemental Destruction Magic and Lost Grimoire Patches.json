  "summary": "Patches to make two leftover spell mods work with the mod Better Spell Learning so that spells are learned gradually. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "I was working on personal playthrough stuff and saw this needed being done. I have always loved the idea of Better Spell Learning but saw that it only had patches for two of the big mods - Apocalypse, Forgotten Magic, and the spells in Frostfall. \r<br />\r<br />I decided to make patches for Lost Grimoire by Steelfeathers and Elemental Destruction Magic, which are two other spell mods which contribute well made spells to leveled lists. \r<br />\r<br />In an immersion playthrough, I like using Better Spell Learning to acquire first spells, then Spell Research to devise new ones. This is incentivized by using Dynamic Item Repricer to create a world where spell tomes are prohibitively expensive so that only the rich can learn magic quickly. \r<br />\r<br />These patches represent a second attempt at patches after my last were discovered to only be a patch for an older version of Better Spell Learning.
