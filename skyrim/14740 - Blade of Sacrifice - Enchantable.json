  "descriptionHtml": "Blade of Sacrifice is now enchantable\r\n\r\nSo I did the related quest early on, maybe level 15 or so. I diligently collected all the Blades of Sacrifice available to me. Got my grand soul gems, headed over to the college, went up to the enchanting table and wtf?\r\n\r\nThis mod does the following:\r\n-Makes the Blade of sacrifice enchantable\r\n-Increases base damage to 12, up from 10, one higher from daedric\r\n-Increased the weapon speed to 1.3 (same as all daggers \\'cept ebony)\r\n-Blade is upgradable, requires ebony ingot (same as daedric)\r\n-Unrelated, but I also changed ebony dagger\\'s speed to 1.3\r\n\r\nMy reasoning behind making this dagger have a stronger base damage than the best vanilla dagger (daedric) was that these blades were given directly by a daedric prince to her followers. It stands to reason that these blades would be at least as powerful as a regular daedric dagger that you can find in the world or even craft yourself. There are only a few in the world (maybe 10? I have 6), and they are not sold by vendors or found as loot.\r\n\r\nI suppose this mod will make the related quest *slightly* more difficult if it has not been completed yet.\r\n\r\nConflicts: Likely none\r\n\r\nInstall: NMM\r\n\r\nUninstall: NMM\r\n\r\nFuture plans?\r\nIf I get really bored i might change the upgrade material from ebony ingot to human heart\r\n\r\nPermissions:\r\nAsk to use\r\nDo not upload to other sites\r\n\r\nPlease endorse if you like",
