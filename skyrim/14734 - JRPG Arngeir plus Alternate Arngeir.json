  "descriptionHtml": "===========\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nWhat was that, Arngeir? You want to be an angsty teenaged warrior who can save the world? WELL TOO FRIGGIN\\' BAD. But hey, with this mod, you can at least look close to one.\r\n\r\nJRPG Arngeir!? WHAT? This possibly isn\\'t as JRPG (KAWAIIDESU~OMG) as the others, so it could also be seen as younger Arngeir. Either way, it\\'s pretty hilarious with his voice. Also, changed his robe to the monk garb so you could actually see his face.\r\n\r\nYou can thank Lobsel Vith for giving me this WONDERFUL and INGENIOUS challenge\r\n\r\n================\r\nAlternate Arngeir\r\n================\r\nI have also included a separate mod which kinda makes Arngeir look like the main character of Witcher with a beard. Please don\\'t try to use this together with JRPG Arngeir, because that won\\'t work. Sorry, no Teen Geralt Hero for you.\r\n\r\n============\r\nRequirements\r\n============\r\n1) ApachiiSkyHair for the hair:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168\r\n\r\nNote: You don\\'t really need this next one. I just use it because it makes males look\r\nbetter. I used the Younger Faces & Geonox version in my screenshots.\r\n\r\n2) Better males - Beautiful nudes and faces - New hairstyles:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2488\r\n\r\n============\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\nPut both the esp and the bsa in your \\\\Skyrim\\\\Data folder. Hopefully, it should work fine.\r\nIf not, tell me and I\\'ll try and fix it myself. This was a really quick job, so I expect\r\nan issue or two.\r\n\r\n=======\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nThanks to Apachii for the hairs, foretrenty for the npc editor, and Chris57 for the face\r\ntextures. I don\\'t care what you do with this mod, but please respect the other guys. ",
