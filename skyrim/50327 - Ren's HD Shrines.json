  "descriptionHtml": "[img width=838,height=598]https://i.imgur.com/pn7FOda.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]All files have the resolution of 1024x1024, double of vanilla[/size]\n<br />[size=3]Please endorse this file if you like it ^___^[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=6]PLEASE READ THIS when installing[/size]\n<br />\n<br />This mod used both textures AND meshes so please install them both, else they won't work properly!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />    [img width=198,height=59]https://i.imgur.com/cPICFkB.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />I thought the vanilla one was too simple, I couldn't really see any detail at all. I noticed the file name was called akatosh hourglass, therefore I wanted that attribute to stand out as the centerpiece of the shrine. Akatosh is the god of time, but the shrine didn't give that impression.\n<br />\n<br />I designed his scales from scratch to accentuate his snake-like body, which wraps around a spherical structure: the hourglass of time. It now looks more glass-like and reflective, and if you look closely, you can see sand falling, aching to a real hourglass. \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ef8da8]Ren[/color]-Detail:[/b] The engraving on the sword reads 'Bormahu' which means father to the dragons.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c0ace2]Alternate Version:[/color][/b] The shrine is now dazzling gold, and the glossy hourglass glows pearlescent.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br /> [img width=262,height=78]https://i.imgur.com/WOeCNkc.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Life and death, and its endless cycle. It didn't really hit me at all when I looked at the shrine in vanilla. \n<br />\n<br />I got inspired by the in-game akatosh amulet, which is more crimson and gold.  Made the two square frames (the star around the sphere) different colors to represent Life and Death as two separate entities. Wanted the whole piece to be as striking as possible.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c0ace2]Alternate Version:[/color][/b] A more subtle version. No more fleshy red!!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />   [img width=244,height=73]https://i.imgur.com/IGYiUDK.png[/img]\n<br /> \n<br />I have to admit her shrine is quite nice in vanilla; however, I think detail gets lost in its monochrome style. \n<br />\n<br />Aedra of beauty, love and lust (some say), I decided to use more bold colors. Black to make it  elegant and captivating, followed by a darker purple and finally with pink, demonstrating its delicate femininity.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ef8da8]Ren[/color]-Detail:[/b] Inside the pink petals, I added a little leaf floating on top of the water vessel.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c0ace2]Alternate Version:[/color][/b] Bored of the Peach version? I brought DAISY too. Orange-y and flowery.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />  [img width=253,height=75]https://i.imgur.com/anw7j5s.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />It was a triangle alright. But that was it. Julianos is supposed to rule over magicka and be the aedra of wisdom. I don't think anyone got that impression when looking at it.\n<br />\n<br />The original shrine files had such a beautiful design hidden by the dark complexion of the shrine.  Magic circles and an all-seeing eye etched into it. I worked really hard to elevate the details but still keeping it from being too flashy. \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ef8da8]Ren[/color]-Detail:[/b] If you play around with your view, you will notice that it's actually very glossy.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c0ace2]Alternate Version:[/color][/b] Now with a brand spanking new design! A magical third-eye. It k n o w s.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/00mOOjo.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Goddess of Air, the heavens and spirits; usually represented by birds. Did you guys know the shrine is supposed to be a bird? I didn't notice at all until I started working on it. Another beautiful shrine lost in its dull colors.\n<br />\n<br />I chose the nice blue-green hues to give you the impression of winds and freshness.  The enveloping whiteness of the shrine, should show the vastness of the sky she represents.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c0ace2]Alternate Version:[/color][/b] You thought the shrine looked too much like mint-flavored ice cream? I understand. So I brought CHOCO and mint flavored shrine.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br /> [img]https://i.imgur.com/nQUdSoW.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />The first shrine I ever worked on. It was very hard to figure out what to change, it was a nice shrine on its own. So I decided to focus on detail. A lot of detail.\n<br />\n<br />I never really liked the face of the shrine; I always thought it was pouting and seemed restless. I edited it  so she appears to be more feminine and serene. I added a lot of carvings all over her design, paying close attention without deviating too much from her style. I'm pretty happy about it ^__^\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ef8da8]Ren[/color]-Detail:[/b] I made mara's intricate background have a see-through feature. The vanilla version only had a black background.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c0ace2]Alternate Version:[/color][/b] Golden Jester Mara\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/pUBEh44.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />The shrine that is the most fun, in my opinion. In vanilla, it seemed too plain to go hand in hand with its quirky model.\n<br />\n<br />I re-designed the horn completely to be made out of tusk and leather wrappings. The water pouring out of the bowl has nice subtle colors. I tried to imitate flowing water as close as possible. God of Charity and Mercy, what's better than to show it through nice fresh endless water. The bowl it sits on, is silver with little claws supporting it.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ef8da8]Ren[/color]-Detail:[/b] The stream of water coming out of the horn is actually translucent.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c0ace2]Alternate Version:[/color][/b] COINS! COINS EVERYWHERE OMG!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/j0TUab7.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />A name that pops up a lot throughout the game, A mighty emperor, dragonborn, and now a part of the Nine Divines. His shrine, modeled after a sword, didn't really scream mighty or strong at all. Was too dull.\n<br />\n<br />Revamped the colors completely, giving it a rusty and dragon-like feel. Made the blade a different color and more luminescent as to show divine power.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ef8da8]Ren[/color]-Detail:[/b] The Carved symbols at the base and hilt, and the golden design along the blade. \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c0ace2]Alternate Version:[/color][/b] Duller and more washed out, like my life. Yay~!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/WCddO9X.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />The simplest shrine of all, and probably the one nobody really remembers. Its dark and solid build, blurred out detail unless you're up close.\n<br />\n<br />The only thing I could do to help the little guy is to make it look like it's made out of a chrome-y material, making it alluring to the eye, and one of the first things you see when you enter a room. \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#c0ace2]Alternate Version:[/color][/b] Dwemer design!! Look at all those tasty golden lines.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]\n<br />Compatibility[/size]\n<br />Works with any mod  that involves using shrines, but not mods that add textures. \n<br />If you got a Texture Pack that edits the shrines but you want to use this mod, just overwrite them with my files.\n<br />[size=5]\n<br />Installation[/size]\n<br />If using NMM, it should be straightforward enough; else, extract the contents of the folder into your data folder. \n<br />If it prompts you to overwrite anything, it means you have a mod that edits the shrines.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Now comes with a Fomod Installer so you can choose a mixture of original, alternate and vanilla shrines to your liking!![/b]\n<br />\n<br />Version History and changes\n<br />2.0\n<br />Main file includes alternate shrines along with original\n<br />Fomod Installer released so can choose between original shrines, alternate and vanilla!\n<br />De-saturated Arkay shrine.\n<br />Fixed Akatosh shrine loading screen lack of colors.\n<br />\n<br />1.0\n<br />Main File released\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]People I want to thank[/b][/size]\n<br />I want to thank these people for their deep support in my work &lt;3 [size=2]\n<br />  [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4363416/?]WilliamImm[/url]\n<br />  [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3821720/?]DigiScamp[/url]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />[center][youtube]p9Ar4oS4UO8&amp;hd=1[/youtube][youtube]HqIrA3vwNnk#t=90[/youtube][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Screenshots Taken with[/b][/size]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37716/?]Somber ENB by Tansarville - Creator and Maeldun0 - Manager[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.enbdev.com/] ENBseries by Boris Vorontsov [/url]\n<br />\n<br />                                                                                                            [img width=182,height=182]https://i.imgur.com/HRYhgXj.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Other Mods\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49747/?][img width=350,height=350]https://i.imgur.com/K8hyLWv.png[/img][/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51456/?][img width=200,height=300]https://i.imgur.com/xkWxX02.png[/img][/url]",
