  "summary": "A few replacement crosshairs for Nvidia 3D Vision users to replace the existing Nvidia 3D sight options with crosshairs.  These sights look more like the standard 2D crosshair used in Skyrim and are similar in size.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I wasn\\'t happy with the default 3D sight options so I went ahead and tried to copy the Skyrim crosshair using some of the tricks found on Nvidia\\'s forum.  I made these for myself but figured why not share. :)\r\n\r\nMade a few more sights and added some attempts at bordered crosshair with a wider \\\"box\\\" in the center. The official crosshair is still thinner I know, but I kept my version mostly symmetrical because I just don\\'t have the necessary skill to blend the colors down to 1 pixel. Still, I think they look pretty good, there\\'s quite a few to choose from.\r\n\r\n \r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\nInstructions:\r\n\r\nJust unzip the file and drop nvstres.dll in C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\NVIDIA Corporation\\\\3D Vision \r\n\r\nThen open up NVCP and choose whichever 3D sight you prefer for Skyrim.
