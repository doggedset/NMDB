  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6]Roadside Keep\r<br />[/size][size=3]Customizable player home\r<br />[/size]\r<br />This castle can be found along the road from Whiterun to Rorickstead. The interior can be changed to Stormcloack and Imperial but i plan to add more faction-styled interiors (like the college, companions or thieves guild). \r<br />To change the interior from Imperial to Stormcloak just flip the lever near the entrance of the keep, when you want to change it back just pull the lever again and you&#39;re fine.\r<br />[size=3]Version 1.1 and higher:\r<br />[/size]When you reach the keep it is locked at first, you will need to find the key first, it is found along the road from Whiterun to Dawnstar (near Shrouded Grove) and can be looted from an imperial commander who has been ambushed.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Features[/size]\r<br />The castle (with imperial or stormcloak furnishing) features a bedroom with storage, a smithy with weapon racks, a throne room and an office with a vault. The College interior is still a work in progress but i decided to add it in this update as as some kind of preview.\r<br />\r<br />This is my first (finished) player home mod so i may upgrade some things later on.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Known Bugs/ compatibility issues[/size]\r<br />[size=2]   *A major issue is a terrain conflict with the &#34;More Bandit Camps&#34; mod. The Steadwich camp across the road has a few &#34;holes&#34; in the\r<br />   ground where this mod overlaps that mod.\r<br />[/size][i]Please put any other bugs you come across in the comments[/i]",
