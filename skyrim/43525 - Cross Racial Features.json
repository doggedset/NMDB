  "descriptionHtml": "I created this mod as a very lightweight simple alternative to others that require SKSE. That being said I do not think that this mod is better than ECE. If you want more options that is the obvious choice.\r<br />\r<br />-Affects all characters except Khajiit and Argonian.\r<br />-All eye shapes can be used on any race.\r<br />-All eye colors can be used on any race.\r<br />-All lips and noses can be used on any race.\r<br />-Doesn&#39;t change NPC&#39;s in game. You can use creation kit with this mod loaded to give them cross racial features though if you wish.\r<br />\r<br />THINGS THIS MOD DOESN&#39;T DO\r<br />-Add Elf ears to non Elves\r<br />-Add Orc mouths to non orcs\r<br />-Remove Orc mouths from Orcs\r<br />-This mod changes lips not mouths unfortunately.\r<br />-Not compatible with ECE unfortunately. :(\r<br />-Not compatible with modded/custom races. \r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION\r<br />Drop the file into your data folder.
