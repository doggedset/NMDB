  "summary": "A strong weapon for the strong warrior.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Forged by a wealthy Imperial nobleman to commemorate his son\\'s promotion to Legate, this blade was constructed with a mix of quicksilver and steel, and blessed at Meridia\\'s shrine in Cyrodiil. It was lost during the Great War against the Aldmeri Dominion.\r\nThe greatsword uses the silver effect and is extra deadly to undead, and can be found at the snowy Talos statue in The Rift near Froki\\'s cabin.\r\nThe sword can be exchanged at the forge for the alternate wield type (1 or 2 hand)\r\n\r\nThanks, Brodual!\r\n[youtube]QiYd0J9crqc[/youtube] [youtube]2jP2fhGFBP4[/youtube]\r\n\r\n0.2 is a completely new .esp so if you\\'re upgrading you\\'ll need to return to the Talos statue and pick the sword up again.\r\n\r\nI had originally wanted to script a power that would only be available while either 1H or 2H versions of the sword were in inventory, that on activation would exchange for the opposite type to emulate how a hand-and-a-half sword can be used either way, but so far I have had no luck. I\\'m severely inexperienced with scripting. I would be grateful for any help with it if a noble soul were to volunteer.\r\n\r\nInspired by a model from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25520]fenry\\'s model pack[/url] and unsatisfied with that model\\'s original appearance I started from scratch and made my own version, and this is the result.\r\n\r\nTo Do List:\r\n1. Find a way to script a lesser power to switch between 1 and 2 handed versions. Help wanted!\r\n2. Refine the model and textures.",
