He went looking for the bandits and when he found them he proposed his idea. Alvor said:”What would you think of us making a facility for 100’s of people where they can craft their weapons and armour?” Robiere had tot think about it and a few moments later he went back to Alvor and he said that it would be great to do that. And so they began to build the building and before they knew it it was finished! After the facility had opened no bandit or thief ever harrased Alvor or Riverwood. \r\n=========================================================================================\r\nThe facility’s features\r\n\r\nThe facility consists out of three rooms:\r\n\r\nThe main hall(where you enter) includes:\r\n- sharpening weels\r\n- workbenches\r\n- anvils\r\n- cooking stands\r\n- smelters\r\n- vendors\r\n- tanning racks\r\n- two dwarven centurion gaurds\r\n- the door to the underforge residence\r\n\r\nThe enchanting section includes:\r\n- enchantment tables\r\n- bookshelves\r\n- a vendor\r\n\r\nThe alchemy section uncludes:\r\n- alchemy tables\r\n- a few recipes\r\n- a bed\r\n- a vendor\r\n\r\nOn the outside there is:\r\n- a choppingblock\r\n- a bedroll\r\n- a little “shrine”\r\n- a weapon rack\r\n\r\nunder the forge is a small player owned room wich contains:\r\n- a bed\r\n- a sharpening wheel\r\n- a workbench\r\n- a alchemy table\r\n- a map of Skyrim\r\n- a weapon rack\r\n- a chest\r\n\r\n*NOTE*\r\nYou need the Breezehome key to unlock the door to the underforge residence.\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nknown issues:\r\n- the roof and the tower aren\\'t showing upon leaving the facility\r\n- there is a guy named Robiere outside of the facility that starts somekind of quest but that leads nowhere. the quest will be added later.\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nFuture plannings\r\n- A added quest\r\n- small twiches\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nLicense\r\nThis mod is licensed to Marnix Mohrmann.
