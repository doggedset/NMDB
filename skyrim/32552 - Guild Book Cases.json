  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]\r<br />[center][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65163/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/QtD7v94.png[/img][/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This group of mods add all skill books from the Combat, Stealth and Magic skill groups to bookshelves in Jorrvaskr, the Thieves Guild, and the Arcanaeum; there are also non-respawning bookcases with relevant topics. Choose yours from the file list&#33; I set the books to become free to take when the player hits the highest rank in each guild, but, as I said, I never join it, so I&#39;ll kindly ask you to tell me if it works; otherwise I&#39;ll tweak things a bit and see if I do it right. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Jorrvaskr[/u][/b] [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=123513081](Steam Workshop)[/url]\r<br />I&#39;m sure the Companions do more than just chest-bump each other all day, right? \r<br />\r<br />The books are organized by skill group, and I placed some static clutter next to them to give players an idea of what each book group is about. The topmost one is Block, and the bottom ones are One- and Two-handed. Hint: to read the books on the bookcase without stealing them, press &#39;ctrl&#39; while browsing it. \r<br />\r<br />I tried not to move things, but since I deleted the tundra cotton, I put a potted one instead. There&#39;s also a small statue of Ysgramor to make the place look a bit livelier. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Thieves Guild[/u][/b] [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=123541995](Steam Workshop)[/url]\r<br />This one was a suggestion and I made it for fun, since I personally do not join this guild. I&#39;m quite sure that you need to learn your theory before you go trying to steal people&#39;s gold&#33; The topmost one is Speech, and the bottom ones are Pickpocket and Sneak. \r<br />\r<br />I tried not to move things, but I removed a barrel there that had a copy of Shadowmarks on top, so be careful if you stored anything in there&#33; \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Arcanaeum[/u][/b] [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=120586446](Steam Workshop)[/url]\r<br />I personally made this one (the first of the series) because I felt the Arcanaeum was a bit disappointing, what with Urag talking so much about how these books are incredibly ancient and all, and then it turns out they&#39;re the same books you&#39;ve found scattered all around Skyrim... \r<br />\r<br />The Spells are organized by school: Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, Illusion and Restoration. As the pictures show, I grouped them together by skill level, so they go from Novice + Apprentice, then Adept + Expert, and finally Master. Here is a list for you to peruse. The Master bookcases have only one or two books each, since several are quest rewards or otherwise unattainable. \r<br />\r<br />Each skill book chest has the five books available per school. Only Magic is included: the books for Combat and Stealth skills are not here, since this is, after all, the College. Next to each chest I placed a static book, so you can know the school each set of bookcases belongs to. And, as an added bonus, I included three bookcases with books that, according to the Creation Kit, are classified as rare, valuable and religious; something for everybody&#39;s tastes&#33; \r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Notes[/u][/b]\r<br />I originally made these mods for the Steam Workshop. Even though it breaks my heart, I&#39;ll tag them as a cheat, since all you have to do is read them to gain the skills. Organizing the books was quite tiresome so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I made a mistake, or forgot a book; if I did, please, let me know, and I&#39;ll fix the problem as soon as I can. \r<br />\r<br />To install, place the files in your &#39;SteamSteamAppsCommonSkyrimData&#39; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
