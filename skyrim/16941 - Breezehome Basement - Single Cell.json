  "descriptionHtml": "\r\n============\r\n\r\n[b]A new version of this mod is avaliable [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21247]here[/url].[/b]\r\n\r\n============\r\n\r\nThis was a mod requested by my fans to make a basement for Breezehome that used stairs instead of a trapdoor. Check out the video and give me some feedback. Also you can find more details listed below.\r\n\r\n[youtube]H0Q7moqx_rY[/youtube]\r\n\r\nAn addition to Breezehome that includes a basement that is reached by using stairs instead of a portal (door or trapdoor etc.). The basement includes various furniture and\r\nand storage items such as:\r\n\r\nenchantment table w/ enchanter\\'s satchel to store gems\r\n6 weapon plaques\r\n1 shield plaque\r\n1 weapon rack (3 spots)\r\n2 mannequins\r\n2 player chests\r\n2 strong boxes\r\nnoble wardrobe\r\n3 bookshelves (10 books on each of the 3 shelves)\r\n\r\nand various other furniture and clutter to decorate the room. You do not have to purchase any additions to get the basement. I didn\\'t include them in the house upgrades to \r\nhelp eliminate any issues people might have. It is just easier for everyone to avoid that.\r\n\r\nBe sure to check out my website and subscribe to me on YouTube for more!\r\n\r\nWebsite - [url=http://www.demorus.com]www.demorus.com[/url]\r\nYouTube - [url=http://www.youtube.com/user/demothekeysmasher]DemoTheKeySmasher[/url]\r\nTwitter - [url=http://www.twitter.com/demotks]DemoTKS[/url]\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy!",
