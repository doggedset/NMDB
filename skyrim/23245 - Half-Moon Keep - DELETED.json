  "descriptionHtml": "====================================================================================\r\nHalf-Moon Keep, an Annotated History: Written by Brother Jean-Luc Deleange of Southmark Priory\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\n[Pieces from Brother Jean-Luc\\'s book]\r\n\r\n\\\"For over 400 years Half-Moon Keep has stood along the southern shores of Lake Ilinalta protecting the South Pass Highway from bandits and other Ne\\'er do wells. This keep has kept a stoic watch along the road in the name of justice. The Lords of the Keep from it\\'s builder Sir Rothke of Graile, to it\\'s current Lord have lived not by the rule of High Kings or Emperors but by the rule of peace and protection.\\\"\r\n\r\n\\\"Sir Rothke of Graile was an inconspicuous man from the small village of Graile in what is today Northern County Chorral. He had a simple upbringing as the son of the local nightwatchman. He grew up respecting his father for watching over and protecting him and the rest of the village as they slept. This selfless profession inspired him to protect those when they are weakest. This is what sent him forth on one quest after another across Cyrodiil, High Rock, Hammerfell and finally Skyrim. In the harsh mountains and deep forests of the Fatherland he found and fell in love with a strong Nord woman who refused to leave her homeland to protect others. Not when her own people needed help. This is when Sir Rothke decided to stay put for once.\\\"\r\n\r\n\\\"Half-Moon Keep, along with her sister keep Ilinalta\\'s Deep, weathered the storm that sunk many small fishing vessels and flooded many coastal communities and continued to keep a vigilant eye on the lake for smugglers and poachers. However once Lord Yngmar of Ilinalta\\'s Deep passed, there were no more of his kin left to rule the keep. This is when control passed to the Imperial Army. Once the Imperials moved in things took a turn for the worse. They quickly depleted the keeps coffers and were running low on gold. This meant the maintenance of the keep was deteriorating. Another storm like the one on the 17th of Hearthfire would surely do the fort in. This fate cannot befall Half-Moon Keep.\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nThe Current State of Affairs in Half-Moon Keep\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\nThe Keep Contains: 1 master bedroom, 1 guest bedroom, servants quarters, a kitchen, dinning hall, and library.\r\n\r\nIn the Courtyard: A stable, a smithy, the barracks, the chapel and a store room.\r\n\r\nOutside the Walls: A dock and merchant have been built.\r\n\r\nAs of now there\\'s no quest to obtain the keep, my creation kit enjoys crashing on me when I open the quest/dialogue editor. So it\\'s just a free home. I\\'ve added a blacksmith, and a general trader to sell with you and in the chapel there\\'s a new enchantment station and alchemy bench. There\\'s also a few new NPCs wandering about the keep; including a bard, chef and maid.\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nRequirements\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\nThe latest version of Skyrim\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\nCredits\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\nBethesda-Creation Kit\r\nArtiSanix-Paintings\r\nHaidaboy-Creation Kit Help\r\n",
