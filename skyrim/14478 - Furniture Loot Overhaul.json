  "descriptionHtml": "[b]UPDATE ON FUTURE![/b]\r\nThe planned huge overhaul will not happened unfortunately. Why not? Because it will make most of the mods in this community incompatible and it\\'s not something I wanted to make.\r\nInstead I\\'ve decided to make slight improvements to version 2.0 and 3.0 to make it up for it that way. What I need is suggestions of which items to put in as loot. Please put your suggestions in the comment section or PM me.\r\n\r\n[b]Description:[/b]\r\nIn the vanilla version all homes got the same identical random unfitting loot and too much gold scattered around their cell in places like the cupboard, night table or the wardrobe, regardless the residents profession or style. I couldn\\'t bare with it so I created this mod which aims to redo the looting in the homes and make it unique. \r\n\r\n[b]What does this mod do?[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]1.0 Initial Release[/b]\r\n- Removes gold from furniture containers and replaces it with misc loot.\r\n- Removes misc loot from wardrobes, like iron pots, charcoal, and clothes iron.\r\n- Adds misc loot and clothes in Orcish furniture that currently had no loot at all.\r\n\r\n[b]v2.0[/b]\r\n- 1% Chance of gold loot.\r\n- Class based loot\r\n- The higher the class the more items in container\r\n\r\n[b]Specified[/b]\r\n- Noble loot will be silver, books and jewelry\r\n- Upper loot will be Glazed, Clutter, books and Jewelry\r\n- Farmer loot will be basic dining, clutter, poor books.\r\n- Orcs loot will be tankards and leather stripes.\r\n- Noble Wardrobe: 4 chances of Fine outfits and a chance to find Jewelry.\r\n- Upper Wardrobe: 4 chances of Merchant, Fine, Working and Farmer outfits.\r\n- Farmer Wardrobe: 2 chances of Merchant, Working and Farmer outfits.\r\n- Orcs Wardrobe: 2 chances of Working Outfits.\r\n\r\n[b]v3.0[/b] - Not recommended for the lazy player. Use v2.0 if annoyed by locks.\r\n- Locks almost every chest in every populated home in civilization. Lock level from novice to expert.\r\n\r\n[b]This mod will depend heavily on your opinions. Please give me some ideas for more content. Also, don\\'t forget to endorse if you like it, I appreciate it.\r\n\r\nChecked out my other mods and fixes?[/b]\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22861 - Indara Caerellia Fix\r\n\r\n",
