  "descriptionHtml": "I was really annoyed with the way SSS work with texture that I found, keep in mind that this is what I wanted to get from SSS , very light tint change and some light bleed for the ears and hands, maybe I&#39;ll do the toes later\r<br />\r<br />There might be seams that appears on very very light skin tone. It was a real pain to fit the layer properly. I&#39;m not a pro drawer just have a little bit of time to have fun tweaking.\r<br />\r<br />What I did, use alpha channel on a skin tone and named it _sk\r<br />\r<br />As was said on enb forum this texture for sss NEEDs to be Alpha channel, not red, rainbow or black and white. With that in mind I use Dmonized UNP base skin for the body as a base texture to see where is what, and for the heads I used I think it&#39;s fair skin as a base to fit the alpha properly, this doesn&#39;t change anything for the skin you use texture you use as long as the placement is the same.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][b]Installation:[/b][/size]\r<br />Use Mod Organiser ( it make thing so simple)\r<br />Load after the skin you use\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Setup:[/size]\r<br />On my screen shot the skin I use is a modified fair skin to be even lighter tone\r<br />Keep in mind that the darker the skin tone the less the effect is visible, you&#39;ll need to push the ENB setting futher \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]Compatibility:[/size]\r<br />Should be Compatible with any UNP, UNPB ,7base skin since they use the same texture base \r<br />I quickly tried CBBE it looked like it worked\r<br />\r<br />For Male character, copy those file to the male directory and rename them to male_1_sk.dds\r<br />it should make them stop glowing also\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Tell me what you think, thx\r<br />\r<br />My ENB setting in SSS\r<br />\r<br />[SUBSURFACESCATTERING]\r<br />IgnoreWeatherSystem=true\r<br />EnableTextureAlpha=true\r<br />Quality=0\r<br />Radius=3.0\r<br />Amount=0.66\r<br />EpidermalAmount=15.0\r<br />SubdermalAmount=25.0\r<br />EpidermalDiffuseSaturation=0.5\r<br />SubdermalDiffuseSaturation=1.0\r<br />EpidermalMix=0.5\r<br />SubdermalMix=0.5\r<br />SubdermalTranslucency=1.0\r<br />SubdermalPhase=0.0\r<br />\r<br />this is use for the screen shot\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Credit\r<br />Boris For ENB\r<br />Dmon99 for base skin body and hands\r<br />HHaleyy for fair skin head\r<br />\r<br />If I forgot some one tell me I&#39;ll modify, or If you don&#39;T want me to use your file in this way I&#39;ll modify them also",
