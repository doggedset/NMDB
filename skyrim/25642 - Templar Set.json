Its okay from my end do not bother to ask. Uploading it to other sites is tricky since parent mods do not allow that. If you do a translation post the translated plugin only and make link to nexus for the full mod. \r<br />- Requests: please have some patience. Got a lot to do in life and in here.\r<br />- Armor is made for a female originally but wearable fully by a male.\r<br />- Circlet is wearable together with the hood.\r<br />- Clipping can be fixed until a certain amount by going it in a 3d program then reexporting the whole stuff. I do not possess the knowledge to do that. Armor pieces are taken from existing mods moved/scaled a bit.\r<br />- Dawnguard: it IS and will be required. Have some feedback on CTD without it.\r<br />- ToDo/WIP/Planned added after Change log: plz read before making a request/suggestion.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/mancer55/Skyrim%202%20nodelete/mancika_bannerbigstripes02log.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.7\r<br />- Cloak and Hood Recipes require Linen Wraps found in ruins and catacombs.\r<br />- Changed Cloak I texture a bit.\r<br />- Added Short Cloaks with variants. Model is the existing Cloak model but shortened with transparency.\r<br />- Reduced &#34;Guardian&#34; size a bit as requested by many.\r<br />- Some weapons swing faster now with reduced damage.\r<br />- Added swords &#34;Sentinel&#34; and &#34;Requiem&#34;. Model based on Holy Negotiator, originally as a 2h sword but also downsized to 1h for the one-handed fans.\r<br />- Cloak&#39;s editor ids renamed for more clarity in CK. Should not affect existing game items for me it did not.\r<br />- Added warhammers &#34;Prophet&#34; and &#34;Malice&#34;. Same model but second one has a shorter handle.\r<br />- Bow disappearing when dropped fixed.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.6\r<br />- Added 2h Sword &#34;Liberator&#34;.\r<br />- Added 1h Sword &#34;Disciple&#34;.\r<br />- Added 2h Hammer &#34;Lorekeeper&#34; which is basically a shortened/downsized &#34;Guardian&#34;.\r<br />- Adjusted &#34;Guardian&#34; position.\r<br />- Little changes/fixes.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.5.1\r<br />- Fix for Black Hood recipe and temper.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.5\r<br />- Armor rating and damage revised, corrected some items. All are now ebony/daedric.\r<br />- Cloaks, cloaks and more cloaks: added more whites, added black versions of all of them, and some again with red markings. Also added 7 pieces with art.\r<br />- Cloak models are all narrowed versions thanks to Jerros.\r<br />- Made a black Hood to wear with black cloaks.\r<br />- Shoulders downsized a lot. Except Armor I. \r<br />- Fixes in nifs again.\r<br />- Reduced texture numbers for performance.\r<br />- Cleaned up the plugin file via Tes5Edit a bit.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.4.1\r<br />- Done a Scabbard for the 2h sword I made. Posted as separate update.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.4\r<br />- Credits and readme changed. Please read it through takes just a short time anyway.\r<br />- Shields have now Vampire races supported I hope everything is done right.\r<br />- One-handed hammer &#34;Defiance&#34; and the mighty greatsword &#34;Eternity&#34; is craftable at local blacksmiths. Note that &#34;Eternity&#34; is my very first scratch-built model for Skyrim and also my first sword ever.\r<br />- Fixes in Nifs. I learned a lot so hopefully did not make them worse:P\r<br />- Armor IV included without neckguard piece per request by many.\r<br />- Cloak II for some change on your back.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.3\r<br />- Added 2 shields named Templar Longshields. Both craftable temperable and enchantable.\r<br />- Fixed minor things in some nifs.\r<br />- Credit section updated to reflect the parent mod&#39;s authors. If someone is missing please contact me.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.2\r<br />- Added 2 Armor and 1 Shield. Armor II is without the fur at the neck (as per request) and Armor III is without the fur and skirt. Shield is the same model but different look.\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.1\r<br />- Hopefully NMM works now.\r<br />- Uploaded circlet files separately since they were missing (*headshot*)\r<br />\r<br />Version 1.0 First release.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/mancer55/Skyrim%202%20nodelete/mancika_bannerbigstripes03todo.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />- Blood objects for the hammers. Parent model did not incude one.\r<br />- Hoods.\r<br />- More shields.\r<br />- Helmets.\r<br />- Who knows...\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/mancer55/Skyrim%202%20nodelete/mancika_bannerbigstripes04video.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]Yk4eFTAXxns[/youtube] [youtube]qjGDmRp7-HY[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]Suaskm-2PK0[/youtube] [youtube]u73m3UKJU88[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]TbKHE5leTz4[/youtube] [youtube]WVFU0ks1Lyg[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/mancer55/Skyrim%202%20nodelete/mancika_bannerbigstripes05descr.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />This mod is about equipment I make for Skyrim. More will come as I make progress and create content I wanted since the game came out. Every piece is craftable at a forge and all of them are enchantable. Most are temperable (everything except cloaks, amulets and the rings).\r<br />\r<br />The hood is a heavy armor piece just because I like hoods more than helmets but this way the additional armor is still there. The circlet is also heavy armor piece just for the hell of it.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/mancer55/Skyrim%202%20nodelete/mancika_bannerbigstripes06notes.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />All parts are made to fit each other so mixing this up with other armor parts may look odd. The armor is made of male and female armor pieces for a female character especially. I did not do much testing on male characters and will not do it either nor will I rebuild the set to fit a male body better than it fits now.\r<br />\r<br />Parts are provided as is but later changes or fixes will be of course done if necessary. Circlet and hood parts are also made to fit beast races. Prices, damages are kept around or a bit above vanilla values, weights are less as they should be in my opinion.\r<br />\r<br />Suggestions, critics and  feedback are most welcome&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Hereby I thank you all for the words in the comments section. Your support really means a lot to me:)\r<br />\r<br />Also cheers to Hothtrooper44 and Jerros for helping me out&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/mancer55/Skyrim%202%20nodelete/mancika_bannerbigstripes65req.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Dawnguard DLC. This is required and will be required.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/mancer55/Skyrim%202%20nodelete/mancika_bannerbigstripes07install.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Install via NMM or copy all the files from data folder into your game directory keeping up the folder structure. Enable esp plugin in launcher or via mod manager.\r<br />\r<br />Before trying this mod you should make a backup save just in case&#33; You have been warned.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/mancer55/Skyrim%202%20nodelete/mancika_bannerbigstripes08uninst.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Disable plugin and delete all copied files.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/mancer55/Skyrim%202%20nodelete/mancika_bannerbigstripes09bugs.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />The usual clipping remains on armor parts. No weight slider supported since I cannot do that.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/mancer55/Skyrim%202%20nodelete/mancika_bannerbigstripes10compatib.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />There should be no problems using all this with anything else except the cubemap installed by this plugin. Cubemaps are there to create the reflection in game. Mine is a higher resolution version and will not cause any harm to your game or save.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/mancer55/Skyrim%202%20nodelete/mancika_bannerbigstripes11credit.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Bethesda for Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />Parent mods and their credits also apply:\r<br />Jerros - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24253\r<br />&#34;Jerros - All the new textures and meshes added to the armor.
