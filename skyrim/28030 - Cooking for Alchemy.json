  "descriptionHtml": "[color=red][center][b]Cooking for Alchemy[/b][/center][/color]\r\n[center]by acdcdave1387[/center]\r\n[center]Both Versions Multilingual[/center]\r\n[center]Nexus exclusive, please let me know if you see my mods elsewhere[/center]\r\n\r\nI thought it was interesting how you can mix ingredients together to create potions and earn Alchemy experience yet when you mix ingredients together for meals you gained nothing from it. Now I understand that cooking food has nothing to do with \\\"Alchemy,\\\" however I disliked the fact that cooking was added to the game with absolutely no incentive to use it. (other than one or two decent meals)\r\n\r\nThis simple mod basically allows all types of cooking pots and fire spits to earn you Alchemy experience when you cook anything. The amount of experience you gain is based on the game code so I can\\'t help you if you feel that the Alchemy experience gain is too little or too much.\r\n\r\n~~Compatibility~~\r\nThis plugin was made with the Creation Kit and only edits the cooking pots themselves.\r\nThis means that mods which add new cooking pots to the game should also benefit from my mod.\r\nThis also means that pretty much nothing will conflict with this mod. If I am wrong please tell me so I can update this section with conflicts with other mods.\r\n\r\n~~Installing~~\r\nVERY SIMPLE. Just copy over the Data folder to your Skyrim folder.\r\nDefault location for Skyrim folder in a 64-bit installation is as follows.\r\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\r\n\r\n~~Uninstalling~~\r\nAlso simple. Just delete CookingAlchemy.esp or uncheck it from your load order.\r\n\r\n~~Optional Version~~\r\nI was also bothered by the fact that the Tanning Rack and the Smelter didn\\'t give experience gains for smithing yet were related to smithing. Some may argue that the Tanning Rack and Smelter only provide ingredients for forging and also don\\'t upgrade the weapons and armor themselves, thus they don\\'t need to give you smithing experience. While this is true, some mods add items that you can create from these two locations. Also, some people just want to speed their smithing up; perhaps they feel it rises too slowly? Or perhaps they started a new game and want to get a head start in catching up to where they were.\r\nAll in all, I made this an optional version because of this.\r\n(ps. there should be no conflicts with crafting overhauls, or mods that add new smelters/tanning racks to the game)\r\nThis optional version is a replacer so to install it, just copy it into your Data folder and overwrite the CookingAlchemy.esp that is already there.\r\n\r\n~~Final Note~~\r\nIf you are interested in crafting at all, do check out my other mod [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28027]WARR - Weapon and Armor Recipes Rebalanced[/url], which alters the recipes of vanilla weapons and armor to use more \\\"realistic\\\" ingredients.\r\n\r\n~~Special Thanks to miraclefreak~~",
