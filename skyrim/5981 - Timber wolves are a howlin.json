  "descriptionHtml": "I actually had this mod ready the day after after I watched the episode that premiered on January 7th but I had some issue with making it work. I had gotten Bah from this shout and Vah from Clear Skies confused. That\\'s some kind of supreme irony right there. I have to determine what each shout is by ear and until now my ears had been a trusted source for discerning what is what.\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P2YJVI-tAY]The shout in action[/url]\r\n\r\nTo install either use the extremely handy Nexus manager or extract the file in the Data folder wherever you installed the game. By default the path is\r\nC::\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of shameless self promotion, here\\'s the other other mod I have uploaded so far.\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3732]Fus Ro Yay[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3783]Fluttershy loves Animal Allegiance[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3985]Trollestia Commands you to Catch on Fire[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4902]LUNA SHOUTS AT TIME AND IT OBEYS[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5201]Whirlwind Dash[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\nAll audio is taken from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic ",
