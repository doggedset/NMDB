  "summary": "Adds an Argonian child, Chases-Starlight. She is adoptable and can be found at the docks of Windhelm. Requires Hearthfire.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Chases-Starlight is an orphaned Argonian hatchling. She spends her days on the Windhelm docks, near the Argonian Assemblage, hoping that she will someday find a family to call her own.\r<br />\r<br />This mod requires the Hearthfire DLC. Chases-Starlight is adoptable, and will behave like any other adopted child, using the same voice as a human girl. She does not replace any other child already in the game.\r<br />\r<br />Note: She cannot wear clothes intended for children. Do not give her clothes as a gift.\r<br />\r<br />Changes:\r<br />-v1.1 Removed Argonian Hatchling race (labelled simply &#34;Argonian&#34;) from playable races. Thanks to boomerkeighley for reminding me that I hadn&#39;t fixed this yet.\r<br />\r<br />-----\r<br />\r<br />I know I&#39;m not the only one who has been disappointed by the complete lack of non-human children across Skyrim. Chases-Starlight is my first attempt to help remedy that and add some more variety. Hopefully, she will not be my last. If all goes well, I plan to continue adding adoptable children of other races in locations where you might expect to find them. Argonians, Khajiit, and Orsimer are my priority to start with, but I may go on to add children from the other races of Mer later.",
