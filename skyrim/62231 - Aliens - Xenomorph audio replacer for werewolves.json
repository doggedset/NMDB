  "descriptionHtml": "I recently came across some Aliens - Xenomorph mods on Steam and Nexus. These mods gave us great Xenomorph textures but nothing for audio replacers for the werewolves we were replacing. I found this a tad annoying so I spent a bit of time tonight trying to find some appropriate files.\r<br />\r<br />In the end I found a modder who did a Xenomorph mod for Oblivion which contained a great deal of audio files I needed. I have created this &#34;audio replacer&#34; for werewolves so you can hear Xenomorphs.\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s the issue. I could not find the audio file which wild werewolves use for a howl. If anyone knows which file it is I can add a replacer file to this mod.\r<br />\r<br />This mod does not actually replace any audio files. It adds audio files which Skyrim loads that you add to the audio file directory. If you want to change back to the werewolves audio sounds then just delete the directory for this mod.\r<br />\r<br />Installation instructions:\r<br />\r<br />Unzip this file.\r<br />Copy/paste it in Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim (it will add the directory structure for the mod and the files).\r<br />\r<br />For most people the actual directory is C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall:\r<br />\r<br />To delete/uninstall you just delete the C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;Sound&#92;fx&#92;npc&#92;werewolf directory.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Here is a list of Aliens theme mods which I found useful:\r<br />\r<br />Wild Werewolves http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9588/?\r<br />Werewolves of Skyrim http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=16021&searchtext=werewolves+of+skyrim\r<br />Werewolves Occurring Naturally http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=91028079&searchtext=werewolves+of+skyrim\r<br />Aliens http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=176344457&searchtext=Aliens\r<br />Xenomorph Alien werewolf replacer V4 http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/42586/?\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Credits go to the_philanthropy on the Oblivion part of Nexus for the audio files in this mod.\r<br />\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/24197/?tab=1&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Foblivion%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D24197%26preview%3D&pUp=1",
