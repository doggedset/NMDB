  "modName": "Improved Arvak (for Immersive Horses)",
  "summary": "Makes Arvak a permanent mount compatible with Immersive Horses. Also changes his bone texture to a skeleton-like color, gives him stat buffs (so he can compete with Shadowmere), a Shock Cloak ability (when in combat) and waterwalking capabilities.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Due to being used to the convenience of having my horses managed by the Immersive Horses mod, once I met Arvak I just couldn&#39;t get over how lacking having him as a temporary summonable steed was. And thus, I ended up modifying him at first to become permanent, but once there I just couldn&#39;t stop myself from giving him some extra abilities. So in other words, my mod adds\r<br />\r<br />[/font][list]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Fully compatible with Immersive Horses (behavior, commands, follower use, inventory, etc.)[/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Permanent, summon spell still works, but had its magicka cost reduced.[/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Constant Shock Cloak ability when combat is entered (10 dmg for 2 seconds per pulse)[/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Resists Shock 100%[/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Waterwalking Ability: It is a bit wonky, in contrast with how the player&#39;s waterwalking effect works, while riding the horse you can sink and swim if you point your crosshair too low when moving.[/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Fortified Healing Rate 4% (in and out of combat)[/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Set as &#34;Aggresive&#34; and &#34;Brave&#34; by default.[/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Flagged as Essential[/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Levels with the player[/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Comes with an Imperial Saddle equipped as default.[/font]\r<br />[/list][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=1]Upcoming: \r<br />[/size][/font][list]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=1]Varied cloaks/resist paired with different flame colors.[/size][/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=1][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Other texture options including [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38432/?]Arvak Skeleton Horse[/url] by [b]cansu[/b][/font], [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/23735/?]Arvak With or Without Flames - Color Packs[/url] by [b]Faelrin[/b].\r<br />[/size][/font]\r<br />[*][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=1]No buffs option.[/size][/font]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=3][color=violet]Requirements:[/color][/size]\r<br />This mod needs Immersive Horses (and its requirements) because Arvak is using their AI packages. Obviously it also requires the Dawnguard DLC.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][color=violet]Installation:[/color][/size]\r<br />Either use Mod Organizer (recommended), or download manually and drop into your Skyrim/Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />Note: This is a replacer for Arvak, if you have any other mod using his textures or mesh, you will have them changed by this.\r<br />\r<br />[/font]",
