  "descriptionHtml": "Boring main quest Ustengrav and Mage college Saarthal opening sequence, and also don&#39;t want to fight Vilkas at the courtyard the 101th time? Ok, just skip that&#33;\r<br />\r<br />I have made a play through of my female dark elf, Lava, a Battlemage (mainly one-handed with shield), who is now on level 16. She has Jenassa as her follower. Unmarried and have not purchased any house yet. There are some ores and gears stored in the chest at Jorrvaskr (in the dining area). Lava also has Lover&#39;s Stone active which gives her no sleeping bonus.\r<br />\r<br />There are some saved games on nexus that simply skipped High Hrothgar and Ustengrav, but most of them stay in Level 1. It is better to have Lava level up so don&#39;t have to spend more time leveling up again. Before I create this I was playing Nord Joey (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51464/) I guess many of you have played as a Nord before, so try something new.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Questline\r<br />Main quest: Just finished Ustengrav, you have to find Delphine in Riverwood.\r<br />Companions: Find Skjor (Before the part that you have to gain your beast blood)\r<br />Mages College: Finish Saarthal, you have to inform the Arch-Mage\r<br />Thieves Guild: not started\r<br />Darkbrotherhood: not started\r<br />Civil War: not started (Ralof side at Helgen)\r<br />\r<br />I have also completed some misc quest from Whiterun and Solitude. I forgot why I got to Solitude, but I am going to support the Stormcloaks in the game later because I never want Maven to be the Jarl (Maven will be the Jarl of Riften if the imperial wins).\r<br />\r<br />Mods recommend to be installed: \r<br />Coverwomen: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3563\r<br />Amazing Follower Tweaks: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15524/?\r<br />Natural Eyes: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3589/?\r<br />\r<br />Change your appearance/race\r<br />Press ` and type showracemenu\r<br />\r<br />Add me as a friend on Steam (kin459011).
