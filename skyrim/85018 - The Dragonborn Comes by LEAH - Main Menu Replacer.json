  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/65163-1-1430509163.png[/img][/center]\n<br />\n<br />This is my very first mod and it simply replaces the main menu's BGM. There are several amazing covers of the song but this one, by far is the most beautiful rendition I have ever heard! I originally came across the music video on Leah's Facebook page and absolutely fell in love with it! The song actually seems to fit right in with the games original soundtrack and I thought it would be a perfect mod. Long story short, I came into contact with her, along with her team and was granted permission to upload the song. If you like what you hear, you can find the rest of her music [url=http://leahmusic.net/]here[/url]. Right now, this mod is for the original/legendary editions of Skyrim. Special Edition is currently underway.  \n<br />\n<br />For those wanting the mod on consoles (whether it be for PS4 or XBox One): I unfortunately will not be uploading it as I've had nothing but bad luck with console mods. However; if there are any modders out there wanting to use this mod on the PS4 or XBox One, I give you full permission to re- upload it. Like every other modder out there, a credit to my name would be nice but most importantly, don't forget about Leah!\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]vF03kI5HbbQ[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]80GoA6NykuE[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Credits:\n<br />[/u][/b]- [url=http://leahmusic.net/]Leah and the rest of team[/url] of course!\n<br />-  Skyrim composer, [url=http://www.artistryentertainment.com/index.html]Jeremy Soule[/url] for his breath- taking compositions.\n<br />- The many talented musicians who have done multiple covers of this song.\n<br />- Youtubers, \"Must Be Lonely\" for his [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o8PSL5ZeoE]video tutorial[/url].\n<br />- Nexus user, arecaidianfox for the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32075/?tab=2&amp;navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D32075&amp;pUp=1]XWM to WAV Converter[/url].\n<br />- Nvidia for their [url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/]GeForce Experience[/url] program that I used to record the video of me sitting at the main menu showing that the mod actually works (plays the full song too!) \n<br />[u][b]\n<br />Installation:\n<br />[/b][/u]Simply download the file, unzip and drop the folder into your Skyrim directory (ie: C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;SteamApps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim&#92;Data) or use a mod manager if you choose. If you have any problems getting the mod to work, send me a message and I will try to resolve it for you. Keep in mind though, I am brand new to modding and am still learning. Your patients with me would be greatly appreciated. With that being said, I hope you enjoy the mod!",
