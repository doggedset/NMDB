It is designed to hold books about the history and people of Dalynaia. Dalynaia is a world of my own creation, and is in no way related to the lore of The Elder Scrolls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n========\r\nThis adds a small chest on the very top level of the Western Watchtower near Whiterun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\n\r\nI intend to include more books to fill out the majority of the history of Dalynaia in this chest. I will update with more books as I complete them, so be warned that the chest will be getting updates, and could potentially result in lost items if stored in the chest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n1. Extract the files to a temporary location.\r\n2. Examine the folder structure and make corrections where necessary.\r\n3. Copy files to (install folder)\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\\r\n4. Start Skyrim Launcher, click \\'Data Files\\', place a checkmark beside the .esp file(s).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\n1.
