  "descriptionHtml": "Well, I\\\\\\'m suprised you made it this far to be honest so in recognition of your patience let me announce the numerous features of this BATCH file.\r\nIt spawns cheese... lots of cheese...\r\n6 types of cheese are spawned 100 times each in the normal edition.\r\n6 types of cheese are spawned 5 times each in the minimal edition.\r\n\r\nPlease do make as many cheese puns as possible.\r\n\r\nQ&A\r\n\r\nQ: My cheese isn\\\\\\'t cheesy enough, how2fix?\r\nA: It ain\\\\\\'t easy being cheesy.\r\n\r\nQ: Why on earth did you post something so pointless?\r\nA: Because I believe in a world where cheese is free, no longer confined to cellars, dining tables and the odd dungeon, I believe that the Dragons were only the first wave of evil to visit Skyrim. The anti-cheese is coming and our only hope to stop him is to combine 1,000,000 cheeses into a warrior who shall be known as Cheeseborn.\r\n\r\nQ: But seriously why?\r\nA: Because I wanted a cheese spawner and an excuse to make cheese jokes, this has solved both of those problems, also I was bored.\r\n\r\nQ: Doesn\\\\\\'t work needfix kthxbye.\r\nA: No one is that stupid.. and in case you genuinely don\\\\\\'t know how to use a batch list...\r\n\r\n1: Download the file (obviously) and then unzip/move/copy into your Skyrim folder.\r\n2: Start Skyrim, load a game, open the console and type in \\\\\\\"bat throwthecheese\\\\\\\" and then your every cheesual desire shall be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nQ: Will there be more cheese?\r\nA: There will always be more cheese...Muhahaha\r\n\r\nQ: (Generic trollolol)\r\nA: (Silence)\r\nQ: You there?\r\nA: No.\r\nQ: Oh well there goes my fun...WAAAAIIIT A MINUTE\r\nA: lol.\r\n\r\nQ: What\\\\\\'s the command?\r\nA: It\\\\\\'s throwthecheese\r\nQ: Should I look up TomSka?\r\nA: Yes\r\n\r\nQ: My game crashes whenever I use this...Uninstalling.\r\nA: It will crash if you use more than a few times, also use it then close the console and then use it again. Also this MOD:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/27959\r\nhelps with spamming cheese.\r\n\r\nQ: Why did you blend the useful stuff with the trash about cheese?\r\nA: They\\'re your eyes, it\\'s up to you to use them, also I appreciate you calling anything in this post useful.\r\nQ: Well I\\'ll let that first bit go then... Thank you.\r\nA: You are most welcome.\r\n\r\nQ: Does this work on XBOX?\r\nA: Go die in a fire.\r\nQ: How about PS3?\r\nA: Sigh... OK if you port every other mod on the nexus to any console I will make a PS3 version, an XBOX version, a DS version, a 3DS version, a Wii version, and to top it off I\\'ll even make a NES version and hell, why not a Game & Watch version (steambox doesn\\'t count.)\r\n\r\n***Mods used in screenshot***\r\nThe only obvious ones running are Skyrim Tropical A Climate Overhaul:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33017\r\nAnd\r\nDagi-Raht Khajiit Race:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20627\r\n\r\nIf there was anything else that you saw and would like to find just comment, that said I am running 255 mods at once so it may not be easy for me to locate.\r\n\r\n***DISCLAIMER***\r\nI am not any kind of modder (yet, maybe one day) if you want to complain about how stupid this is then feel free.\r\nIf you genuinely have a problem with it then please feel free to press the close button on this tab and continue looking at the nexus.\r\nIf there is a rule on being pointless then I\\\\\\'ll remove this.\r\nAlso if anyone wants to advise on the categorization of this \\\\\\\"mod\\\\\\\" and anything else just comment.\r\nThis mod is not designed for... Seriousness, so if you complain in that kind of tone... expect either silence or... something or other.\r\nTrolls: Come at me bro.\r\nBut seriously, troll me all you want but if anyone else posts something that you feel like trolling just don\\\\\\'t ok, cool. (cuz telling a lorry not to crash into you works right?)\r\nFinally I am not responsible for your PC spontaneously combusting etc etc..\r\nI can\\'t foresee any risk of using this batch file however I will not be held responsible for any damages caused.",
