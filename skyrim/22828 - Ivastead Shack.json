  "descriptionHtml": " This mod ads a small shack to the east of Ivarstead on a small island next to Geirmund\\'s tomb. It\\'s desgined for beggining level people because through all my playthroughs I found that I started to become overencumbered whenever I started the quest when you must go up the 7000 steps.\r\n\r\n This is my first mod, so I\\'d love some CONSTRUCTIZE critisims as well as bugs or fixes. I pan on doing another, similar mod for Vampire characters in the new future, so if you have ideas for that post as well.\r\n\r\n If you want to know who owned the house and why it\\'s empty, look for the note next to the burnt corpse beside the house (Just in front of deer skinning table) and the owner\\'s journal next to the bed inside/",
