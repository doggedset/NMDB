  "descriptionHtml": "**************************************************************************\r<br />* Body by Race with Vanilla Clothes by Puff The Magic Dragon *\r<br />**************************************************************************\r<br />\r<br />===========\r<br />Description:\r<br />===========\r<br />Inspired by the work of Caliente&#39;s amazing CBBE and Vanilla Clothing for CBBE, coupled with JoshNZ&#39;s Body By Race, I felt like going the extra mile.\r<br />\r<br />This mod gives each individual race a unique weight slider spectrum based on Caliente&#39;s CBBE bodies. For example, elves will be leaner and smaller breasted while Nords and Redguards will be broader and full figured. Additionally, this mod applies these weight slider settings to many vanilla clothing and armors - those supported by Caliente&#39;s Vanilla Clothing for CBBE mod. This means that the clothes match the body for each race&#33; This mod only supports the CBBE &#34;NeverNude&#34; style.\r<br />\r<br />The latest version supports all playable races. If you only want a single race, Nord and Bosmer are already available. Other races will require a lot of demand for me to make a single race pack - making plugins for this is just a pain in the neck.\r<br />If you do use individual race packs, please keep in mind that the plugins are NOT compatible with each other, so you can only use one at a time.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />================\r<br />Special Features\r<br />================\r<br />Unique racial weight slider ranges.\r<br />Limited Vanilla clothing support.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />==============\r<br />Requirements\r<br />==============\r<br />Calientes Female Body Mod Big Bottom Edition -CBBE- for skin texture compatibility.\r<br />    http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666\r<br />Calientes Vanilla Outfits for CBBE is optional, but I can&#39;t promise the textures will look good (or work at all).\r<br />    http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12273\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />============\r<br />Installation\r<br />============\r<br />Recommended NMM:\r<br />Click and run&#33;\r<br />Latest version is 2.2, a single download with all meshes and the most recent plugin.\r<br />\r<br />Manual:\r<br />Extract the files directly into your &lt;game folder&gt;Data folder.\r<br />Activate the .esp in your Skyrim Launcher.\r<br />\r<br />Upgrade Notes:\r<br />Upgrading from v2.1\r<br />Deactivate the older version in NMM.\r<br />Activate the new version in NMM.\r<br />A &#34;Clean save&#34; is not necessary.\r<br />Version 2.1 and earlier had the prisoner clothes meshes misnamed for some races. This is due to a failure on Bethesda&#39;s part to stick to a naming convention, along with a failure on my part to check for such errors. This will be most noticeable in Chargen when starting a new game.\r<br />If you do not wish to download the entire package again, you can simply go into your &#34;meshesClothesprisoner&#34; folder and delete the first race name from meshes that have the race name in them twice. For example, rename &#34;prisonerclothesNord_fNord_0.nif&#34; to &#34;prisonerclothes_fNord_0.nif&#34;. Unless you&#39;re on dialup, I recommend downloading the updated package.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />=============\r<br />Compatibility\r<br />=============\r<br />If you are playing the Falskaar mod, by AlexanderJVelicky, (link: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37994/ ), you may run into a bug that causes guards to run around naked. I&#39;m not sure what is causing this, but Xanthumn has graciously built a compatibility patch. If you&#39;re playing Falskaar and have naked guards, try installing the optional patch file.\r<br />\r<br />USE ONLY ONE (1) RACE PACK AT A TIME&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; The plugins are not compatible with each other.\r<br />This mod changes several of the ArmorAddons - specifically those for all armors supported by CBBE Vanilla. Additionally this mod changes the corresponding Armor items. I recommend putting BBR last in your load order, behind Caliente&#39;s CBBE, Caliente&#39;s Vanilla Outfits for CBBE - Combined Pack and Caliente&#39;s Vanilla Outfits for CBBE - Soldier Pack, if you run into any conflicts, or you&#39;ll wind up with NPCs (or you&#33;) walking around with no torso.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />=====\r<br />Notes\r<br />=====\r<br />Supports all races in the 2.0 release. Nord and Bosmer races have individual race packs.\r<br />Caliente&#39;s BodySlide tool exports many (but not all) of the armor/clothing meshes with the wrong texture information for the nude/skin portions of the mesh. Testing in game has not shown this to be an issue, since the game attaches the correct textures at run time, but I&#39;m working on a way to fix the texture data in the meshes en masse so that there&#39;s no possibility of a bug cropping up later.\r<br />There may be clipping on some meshes during animations. It&#39;s pretty much impossible for me to fully test every single mesh with every single animation to ensure that there is no clipping. If you run into something glaring that you just can&#39;t play with, let me know and I&#39;ll see if I can fix it - but I can&#39;t make any promises.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />===============\r<br />Version History\r<br />===============\r<br />Version 1.0 - Version 1 - Support for Nord race, including Vanilla CBBE Combo and Soldier packs.\r<br />Version 1.0 - Added Bosmer race in a separate pack.\r<br />Version 2.0 - Full support for all playable races in a single package. Individual race packs deprecated. Also made some adjustments to the Nord body so the breasts look more realistic.\r<br />Version 2.1 - Fixed a bug in the plugin file that caused the weight slider to not work with the naked mesh, leaving awful gaps.\r<br />Version 2.11 - Integrated v2.1 plugin and v2.0 bodies into a single download.\r<br />Version 2.2 - Uses the same v2.1 plugin, but fixed some misnamed meshes (prisoner clothes).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />================\r<br />Future Plans\r<br />================\r<br />Release a set of PowerShell scripts and BodySlide instructions for people who may want different styles than what I&#39;ve set here.\r<br />\r<br />Test if I can create a master plugin that will work if I give each race its own plugin and allow users to download only the race packs they want to use and still be compatible.\r<br />\r<br />Upload better screenshots&#33; If anyone wants to help me in that department, you&#39;ll be my best friend forever and ever&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />===============\r<br />Credit goes to:\r<br />===============\r<br />Caliente&#33; Yeah, you did all the REAL work&#33; http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666\r<br />JoshNZ for inspiring the race-based phenotypes. http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20145\r<br />Caliente for making such an awesome BodySlide tool with support for batch creating vanilla meshes&#33;\r<br />The cast and crew behind TES5Edit&#33; Oh yeah they made this easy.\r<br />Xanthumn for the Falskaar patch&#33; \r<br />\r<br />And many thanks to Bethesda for making such an awesome game and for making the creation kit that lets people like me with way too much free time modify the game.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to God for creating us all&#33;",
