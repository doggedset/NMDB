  "descriptionHtml": "Heyo&#33; \r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m just going to get right to the point, this mod adds a trio of characters from the AAB series, the best book series in Skyrim. Originally Malic was supposed to be part of the trio but...he attacked everything in sight so to oblivion with him. This mod adds The Skooma Dealer, Scotti, and Seshs as followers, who you can find in Whiterun, behind Warmaidens. \r<br />\r<br />Scotti is...as he is in the book a coward and will run away.\r<br />\r<br />Gemulurs or whatever his name was, will also run away, but will fight when an enemy gets too close, he only cares about himself and honestly could not care less about whether or not your get disemboweled by a giant.\r<br />\r<br />Shehs will charge right in and start hitting things with an axe, but will always insult you...for some reason.\r<br />\r<br />Credit to The Race Menu mod for allowing me to make Shehs yellow. I&#39;m not 100% sure it&#39;s a free resource but if it&#39;s not tell me and this mod will be down faster than a skeever&#33;",
