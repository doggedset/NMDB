  "descriptionHtml": "Since adding my Arondil Thalmorised, I made this mod also to make the College of Winterhold NPC known as \\\"The Caller\\\" into a Thalmor wizard, she has a diary to tell her backstory as well as she is made oh-so-more powerful.\r\n\r\nThis gives you a good reason this time to kill her since the vast majority of people hate the Thalmor. :P\r\n\r\n* Trouble ,ocating FaceGen data for she as she has an unique appearence, you *may* expect a gray face bug but her appearence is based off vanilla Altmer NPCs",
