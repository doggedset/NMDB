  "modName": "Annoying NPC Helper",
  "summary": "Changes NPC&#39;s in various ways, can be used for fun, or just because you are SO SICK of some NPC&#39;s. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod will transform all of the annoying NPC&#39;s in Whiterun Hold cities into something different, usually a creature. For example, Embry in Riverwood becomes a Dremora, and Farengar Secret-Fire Becomes a Werewolf. However, they do not become hostile, and you can almost always interact like you would usually... except you will be laughing. All of the &#34;Quest Essential&#34; NPC&#39;s are still able to be talked to, and nothing will have changed except their appearance. The ones that were not &#34;Quest Essential&#34; are sometimes not able to be talked to, however, these are the same NPC&#39;s that when just walking by them, will say the same things that they would if you talked to them, so again, nothing is affected accept their appearance. \r<br />\r<br />- There is no Readme file, just read this.\r<br />USING NMM (Recommended)\r<br />1. Click the &#34;Download with NMM&#34; Button\r<br />2. Activate File\r<br />\r<br />NOT USING NMM\r<br />1. Download file\r<br />2. Unzip it\r<br />3.

Things like that. ",
