  "summary": "Another player home for Skyrim... Why, because I wanted one that felt like a Skyrim environment... Sort of anyway... ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Simply put this is the kind of home I think any Dovahkiin would be proud to own! I have been using Shawk\\'s Dovahkiin Hideout and love it and will keep using it, I just wanted another home away from home...\r\n\r\n04/03/2012  Quick update: (for those that read these things... )  I just went back to work but I\\'m hoping to have an update soon and plan to bundle a few weapons with Northern Bastion... Skull Warhammer, Skull Sword, Smith Masters Warhammer, skull bow (if my mesh stops exploding in game... grrr!), Arrows... maybe more... a skull shield maybe!!!\r\n\r\nThis mod contains a Crafting area, Weapon and armor display area, a bedroom, pool, my personal Dovahkiin Chapel* , a main hall with a bar, a vault for your miscellaneous goodies, a library, dragon mask stands... So... Numbers... let\\'s talk numbers...\r\n\r\n14 Mannequins \r\n295 Book slots on various shelves\r\n63+ Weapon racks\r\n12 Weapon racks on pillars I plan to use for my collected bows\r\n10 Teleports -Breezehome\r\n                 -Hjerim\r\n                 -Vlindrel Hall\r\n                 -Honeyside\r\n                 -Skyhaven (you have to retrieve the key from skyhaven to use this)\r\n                 -Proudshire Manor\r\n                 -Arch Mage Quarters\r\n                 -Understone Keep\r\n                 -Ragged Flagon \r\n                 -Jorrvasker\r\n(You have to also have the house key to the corresponding teleport) Pretty sure I locked them all... :P\r\n\r\nIncluded a pic of the location.\r\n\r\nFuture plans for Northern Bastion... Add various House servants, potion racks, hopefully some radiant quests, more NPC\\'s and Followers, combat arena etc... it\\'s all up in the air right now.\r\n\r\nPlease if you find any bugs or have suggestions let me know... \r\n\r\nRelease Log\r\n\r\n1.0 Initial Beta Release... Mostly for getting some feed back...\r\n\r\n1.1 Didn\\'t work... never released\r\n\r\n1.2 Working... Added Navmesh, teleports, 3 merchents, and changed the layout somewhat \r\n      to accommodate the new rooms.  \r\n      NOTE:  Followers might teleport out but will not teleport back with you they will \r\n                remain behind... I will try to have this sorted for the next release and \r\n                the navemesh may not be working 100% and I intend to have that fixed for \r\n                1.3 also...\r\n1.21 Some Navmesh tweaks, and fixed a small problem with teleports... Followers will \r\n               now follow you through both ways through all the teleports.\r\n3.0 Added guards, 6 Npc\\'s ( 2 merchants, 2 trainer/followers, 1 follower, 1 trainer)\r\n               Added 3 new teleports to Understone Keep, Ragged Flagon and \r\n               Jorrvasker.\r\n               Added Prison, Training area and Guards Barracks (Not fully operational yet)\r\n3.1 Added Skull shield, Skull war hammer, Skull sword, Shredder Arrows, and Forgemasters war hammer (requires NorthernBastion 3.0, 3.1 is simply an add on for now as I messed up when I added the arrows, and extra skull sword it will be one file in the next version... )",
