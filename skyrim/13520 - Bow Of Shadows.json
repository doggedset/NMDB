  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#8888ff][b][size=4]Bow Of Shadows[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]    Description:[/b]\r\n\r\n    Adds a completely new bow to the game (new mesh + new texture), which was created by me (under Trollf nickname) for the Oblivion some time ago, with an inspiration that comes from the model of such bow present in Morrowind.\r\n\r\n    This version has all stats of Elven bow but the damage, which is like that of a Deadric bow. The bow can be upgraded as well and has no any enchantments.\r\n\r\n    You can find it in Shadowgreen Cavern, though it rests in not so obvious place there. If you can\\'t locate this cavern then know that\\'s a kind of a quest for you to find it - just search www.uesp.net page for any info about this cave\\'s location ;]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]    Installation:[/b]\r\n\r\n    » Copy BowOfShadows.bsa, and BowOfShadows.esp files to \\\"Skyrim\\\\Data\\\" folder (default path from Steam\\'s main folder is: Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data).\r\n\r\n    » In Skyrim Launcher choose \\\"Data Files\\\" and make sure that checkbox near BowOfShadows.esp is selected.\r\n\r\n    » Start the game and load your any save - go to Shadowgreen Cavern to find it. And if you aren\\'t of an adventurer type and want to obtain the bow quickly just execute in game\\'s console the following command:\r\n\r\n    startquest axBowOfShadowsQuest\r\n\r\nand the bow shoud be added to your character\\'s inventory.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]    Removal:[/b]\r\n\r\n    » Delete the same files you copied previously during the installation proccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]    Known Issues / Compatibility:[/b]\r\n\r\n    This mod adds only a new stuff. It doesn\\'t overwrite or change anything from the original game thus incompatibility with other mods has been reduced to minimum.\r\n",
