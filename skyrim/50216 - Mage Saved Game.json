  "descriptionHtml": "Just my Skyrim Save\r<br />Name: Eraal\r<br />Race: Imperial\r<br />Level: 38\r<br />Focus on magic, but since I started the dark brotherhood quests I have been improving the assassin skills. All map have been discovered ( cheat ). Completed the main quest, college of winterhold main quest and the dark brotherhood. No cheats that can cause any problem for leveling up the char or in the story of the game were used. Lakeview Manor ( Falkreath ) is almost complete, Dawnguard and Dragonborn started, but not complete. \r<br />Best Skills; Conjuration ( Mastered ), Destruction, Alchemy ( Mastered ), Smithing ( Mastered )\r<br />Working on Sneak, Speech and Enchanting.\r<br />IMPORTANT: 1. If you already have a save with the same name and want to keep both, you can rename this one and will work just fine. 2. If you don&#39;t want to play with Eraal, you can use &#34;showracemenu&#34; cheat or download the mod ShowRaceMenu Alternative by Seb263.
