  "descriptionHtml": "[b][color=red]WARNING PLEASE READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING:[/color][/b]\r\nBefore downloading this mod please note that Hadvar does not have his original voice because it is not programed for the \\\"Follow me\\\" and marriage dialogues so I replaced it with the Brute voice which is close enough to his original voice but not a whole lot. So before commenting about the voice read this because I don\\'t want to hear the complains about it when you where warned.\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Description:[/color]\r\nThis mod allows you to marry Hadvar and have him as a follower! He is found Riverwood by the blacksmith. To marry him just simply get a Amulet of Mara from the Priest in Riften (If you have one already and there is no option to marry him go to Riften and talk to the priest because you must talk to the priest to unlock the features of marrying people in Skyrim!) and once you are wearing it talk to him and you should see an option like \\\"Interested me?\\\" etc...\r\nTo have him follow you just choose the action \\\"Follow me. I need your help\\\". \r\n\r\n\r\n[color=orange]How to install:[/color]\r\nTo install it manually just copy the mod file and paste it into the Skyrim Data folder.\r\n",
