Blacksmithing ! So I have decided just to add more Design to my Forge. I was tired of the Vanilla look and even no other HD Texutre Mods added some different Materials or Colors to it. I have completely Redone the Blacksmithing Materials with completely new HD Textures from Scratch. Only the Finest Metal and Wood components were used to build this Forge.\r\nNoble Woods like Honduran Rosewood and Walnut Wood and some other Woods were added in the Workbench and and other Wood components of the Forge. Better Hardened Metal for the Anvil,Hammer and Tonge.\r\n\r\nYou will see the Difference as soon as you see your Forge !\r\n\r\nAlso take a look at the Screenshots and watch the Video for Further Details !\r\n\r\nSo this Mod will change following Components of the New Design Forge HD\r\n\r\nBlacksmith Hammer\r\nBlacksmith Tonge\r\nBlacksmith Anvil\r\nBlacksmith Bellow\r\nBlacksmith Forge the Stones around the Forge\r\nBlacksmith Workbench\r\nBlacksmith Workbenchtop\r\nBlacksmith Grindstone\r\nBlacksmith Sharpening Wheel Woods\r\n\r\nIf you like this Mod you can support with your Endorsments.\r\n\r\nI am also working on another Version with other Materials and different look.\r\n\r\nEnjoy now your new Design Blacksmith Forge in HD ! 1K+2K New Textures\r\n\r\nIf you dont like the too Shiny look of some components of the Forge you can download the Optional Hotfix for the Shiny look. Install the Hotfix after the Main Version.\r\n\r\nCredits to Nexus and Bethesda\r\nCredits to Obsidian Dawn for some Textures I have used.\r\n\r\nHXP[/CENTER]",
