  "descriptionHtml": "Just before the civil war erupted across Skyrim, a well traveled Nord and a beleaguered Dark Elf, brothers from older adventuring days, decided to settle down as neighbors and live the simple farming life.\r\n\r\nWhat This mod adds; A new settlement beside the Western Watchtower, with a goat ranch and a micro brewery. A new ingredient \\\"hops\\\" has been added to the game for alchemy purposes, and Bleakwind Bjorn sells his now famous Bleakwind Brew from his humble Bleakwind home.\r\n\r\nBleakwind Brew: a costly but potent ale that restores stamina, increases magicka regeneration, and a small amount of health over time. Surely Bleakwind Bjorn is the finest alesman in Skyrim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompatible with Western Watchetower Restored.",
