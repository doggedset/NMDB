  "summary": "a medium sized player home overlooking the mountains near Ivarstead. It includes a master suite, armory, large smithy, alchemy cove and library. What makes this home unique is it not just an area to display your things but a living, breathing home perfect for roleplaying. It can be found on the cliffside just past Hilgrunds Tomb.",
  "descriptionHtml": "*********************************************************************************************************************************\r\nDisclaimer - Due to an issue with the creation kit the house/bridge will sometimes be missing when arriving/fast traveling to the house for the first time, after entering the interior the house and bridge will reappear. Also because of this issue in some cases the area where these objects are in become to hard to load and causes the game to ctd. hopefully the devs will patch this issue soon.\r\n*********************************************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nThis mod is not compatible with Darkwater Keep\r\n\r\n========================================================================================\r\nBefore the Dominion invaded Cyrodiil a archeologist studying the dwemer roamed the skyrim countryside, eventually as the years passed he settled down to a quiet life, now after his passing and with no heirs to leave his home to it can be claimed as your own. \r\n\r\nThis furnished player home rests along a rocky outcropping overlooking beautiful waterfalls. An enclosed courtyard and stables gives you the comfort of knowing when out in the world slaying dragons, looting barrows or saving the land, the treasures you have accumulated remain safe behind stone walls. \r\n========================================================================================\r\n\r\nThere is an unwritten quest to obtain the house, the gates are locked and the key is found on the corpse of the previous owner. Head up the mountain trail towards Ivarstead and you will find him guarded by a spriggan matron on the side of the road. Once I know more about writing quests I will have a more detailed quest with actual dialogue between the player and NPCs. Until then reading the journal in the bedroom will give you an idea of the history of the manor.\r\n\r\nThe house boasts a fully functioning armory and many display areas including:\r\n9 armor mannequins\r\n18 weapon plaques\r\n9 large display cases\r\n8 small display cases\r\n12 activated bookcases\r\nand multiple trunks and safes in most rooms.\r\nOn the first floor you will find the master bedroom with private bath. A large kitchen complete with cooking spit, stocked shelves, and a small servants quarters. A formal dining area centrally located as you enter. A quiet reading room with hearth, and mages crafting room near the stairwell complete with alchemy and enchanting workbenches, lots of storage, and an ingredient growing alcove.\r\nUpstairs includes a large Armory to display all your spoils of war and a large Arboretum with a few hidden surprises. The basement holds the smithy as well as former jail cells from the manors previous life as an imperial outpost. Also in the basement is a small training area.\r\n\r\n###########################################################################\r\nCredit goes to Blary for his containers and Darkrider for his paintings, \r\nplease do not use any items without crediting the original authors.\r\n###########################################################################\r\n\r\nAlso - some of the textures seen in the screenshots are from mods installed on my computer, the mods are from other authors and are not included in this mod.
