  "descriptionHtml": "Talen-Jei kept following me as I wandered the bar, and was worse than a puppy. The rogue in me hated this. He has a fiancee already, so WHY is he so attracted to me? ... Sooo.... Since he didn\\'t attack me, I decided that he deserved a bit of a break.... before I broke something else of his. :) \r\n\r\nI have changed the target of his attraction from the Player, to his fiancee, so he shouldn\\'t hover around the player all the time, as he wanders around the inn. He said he has work to do, so let him get back to it! ",
