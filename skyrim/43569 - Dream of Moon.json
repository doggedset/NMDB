  "descriptionHtml": "This garden home is located on the quiet shores of beautiful Lake Ilinalta.  It is the perfect weekend retreat featuring all crafting amenities, a fully functioning fishery and a lovely garden just waiting to be planted.  Read the history, locate the key and make this your private getaway.\r\n\r\nThis is first release, so there are probably some bugs.  Let me know and I will fix them.  It does require Hearthfire, which I believe is much underrated because it adds a wealth of assets to be used in modding.\r\n\r\nUnpack the two files to your Skyrim Data folder.  A marker will be placed on your map east of Half Moon Mill, north of Falkreath and across the lake from Ilinalta\\'s Deep.  It\\'s immediately available, so fast travel there.  Read the book on the bench to learn the history of the cabin and how to find the key.  If you need a little help, there is a circlet in the chest by the deck and a spell tome in the gazebo if your magicka is high enough.\r\n\r\nFeatures include:\r\n\r\nInside\r\n\r\nKitchen with crafting spit, oven and cooling rack\r\nDining for four\r\nSitting area with fur covered benches\r\nThe barrels and crates on the overhang are just clutter - nothing useful\r\nSumptuous midnight blue bedroom\r\nCellar with food storage, cold storage, alchemy and ingredients\r\nSecond bed in the Cellar with some storage\r\nSecret room - look for the pull chain behind the stairs\r\nBookshelves for more than 100 books\r\nA special shelf on the desk in the bedroom will hold 18 Journals\r\nCustom paintings\r\nEnchanted weapons and jewelry - not the shabby stuff either\r\n\r\nOutside\r\n\r\nDeck with Gazebo for evening dining\r\nPlantable garden with  trellis and space for 24 plants (2 are on deck)\r\nForge, smelter, workbench, tanning rack, grindstone and a few raw materials\r\nFishery, tame mudcrabs, tame slaughterfish, fish and clams\r\nPractice dummies and target\r\nWood Chopping block with axe (I always seem to be without)\r\nStable, chickens, nests and a goat\r\nLook down as you are walking - there\\'s more  ;) \r\n\r\nOh - and beware the neighbors.  They show up unannounced the first time, but are easily dispatched.\r\n\r\n**A couple of additions - \r\nI cleaned some of the cobwebs and increased lighting for those of you who got the first release \r\nThere is a small lever inside by the dockside door that will change the tapestry colors to bright colors \r\nThere is a small lever under the stable side deck just below the lampost that will add more chickens \r\nAlso, if you have Better Dark Brotherhood, it\\'s nearly impossible to get the key due to a teleporter placed in the area - use code 020080a9 to add it\r\n \r\nPlease endorse it if you like it.\r\n",
