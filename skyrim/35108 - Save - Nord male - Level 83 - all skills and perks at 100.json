  "summary": "Save created on an older version of Skyrim using the Oghma Infinium book glitch.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Primarily created for those who\\'ve already beaten it, those who don\\'t want to go through all the hassle of leveling up, or just want to start with a high class to see what interesting things can happen early in the game. Can use console command(showracemenu) to create your own character. Legendary option is open in the leveling menu. Character is located in a fully furnished Breezehome. As you exit, be prepared for a crap load of NPCs interacting with you according to the leveling system as you\\'re now a level 83. Don\\'t be scared!!! This character has no bounties, and hasn\\'t done anything bad. The Oghma Infinium book is located on the shelf in the lab, and can be used one last time, but there is no need. Have fun and good luck!\r\n\r\n\r\nCharacter          - Nord/Male\r\nLevel                - 83\r\nSkills/Perks       - 100\r\nPerk points left - 3\r\nBounties           - 0\r\nJailed               - 0\r\nMurders            - 0\r\nThefts              - 0\r\nLocations          - 27\r\nGold                 - 993327\r\nLocation           - Breezehome\r\n\r\nMain Quests open:\r\nThe way of The Voice\r\nThe Golden Claw\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous Quests open:\r\nSpeak with the leader of the Companions\r\nJoin the Stormcloak rebellion\r\n\r\n\r\nQuests completed:\r\nDiscerning the Transmundane\r\nDragon Rising\r\nBleak Falls Barrow\r\nBefore the Storm\r\nUnbound\r\n\r\n\r\nRequierments:\r\nDawnguard\r\nHearthfire\r\nDragonborn\r\n\r\nMods used:\r\nNone",
