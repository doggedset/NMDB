  "descriptionHtml": "Half Elves, sometimes called Ehlnomer for their mortality, are the children of Man and Mer. They are excellent speakers, as they need to be to get along with the other races that think of them as lesser folk. The Stormcloaks have great disdain for them, even greater than that of typical elves. The different races are not often attracted to each other, so these people are rare.\r\n\r\nStats:\r\n+10 Speech\r\n+5 Archery\r\n+5 One Handed\r\n+5 Light Armor\r\n+5 Illusion\r\n+5 Block",
