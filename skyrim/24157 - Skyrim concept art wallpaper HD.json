I am happy with this...but tbh, there is too much detail, giving it an unreal quality.\r\n- Nightingale - This is an older piece I finally got back to. I like the sense of movement: the flowing cape and hair...and posing.\r\n- Orc Tough Guy - Pure characterture. Had a lot of fun with this.\r\n- The Spell - This is an older pic that missed the the first version. The spell effect is ok (I think).\r\n- Companions - Somewhat comical and Easily my silliest image, this is good for a laugh...and I do like the rendering quality.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 or 3 other images that I hoped to upload, unfortunately I don\\'t have the time to finish them atm....Not a huge update, nevertheless I hope you like it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV1 Image list:\r\n\r\n- Ancient Spriggan       - This image was difficult to produce, (early versions were unappealing)..but the final works..i think.\r\n- Province of Skyrim     - Colourful still life...and nice desktop.\r\n- Lover of Dragons       - A kind of follow-up to \\\"Eldergleam Dream\\\".\r\n- Lament                - This is not for everyone..but has its appeal.\r\n- Solitude               - My first and only environmental piece...and very popular (thanks guys).\r\n- Briar Heart           - Are these heartless guys undead?..Not too sure.\r\n- Tundra Timeout    - This humorous image started life as a serious piece..but that didn\\'t last long.\r\n- The Mists of Solitude  - A dramatic edit of this image may be a little cheesy..but I like it (guilty..)\r\n- Vorstag                - Just a minor edit here...with an edgier feel.   \r\n- Eldergleam Dream. - My most popular image..and probably my best. Alternative version included.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecommended usage:\r\n \r\nCreate a wallpaper folder in a suitable location (if you dont already have one).\r\nExtract the files \\\"Skyrim_HD_wallpapers_1920_1080\\\" to that location. Right click on the image you want as your wallpaper, and click on \\\"Set as desktop background\\\"\r\nDesktop background switcher highly recommended (Windows 7 has this feature built-in).\r\n\r\n\r\nPermissions:\r\n\r\nPlease PM me with any requests.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks again guys:\r\n\r\nTo all my friends and colleagues in the Imageshare..your support of my work..and your inspirational screen-art has had a huge influence on me...thank you!!\r\n\r\nAll comments, sugestions, critics wellcome.",
