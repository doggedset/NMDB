  "descriptionHtml": "Small player home located just outside of Riverwood. Contains several mannequins, weapon racks and plaques, Crafting and Enchanting tables, and plenty of storage room with a great view of Skyrimâ€™s best town. Includes a hidden sanctuary in the basement with even more storage.\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginally made just for me but I am such a nice guy I decided to share it with the world. Lucky you. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nEdit: Update finally uploaded! Fixed some bugs with floors and the navmesh on the deck as well as giving it an overall more polished feel. Hurrah.\r\n\r\nEdit: Added a tanning rack and grinding wheel to the house\r\n",
