  "summary": "This mod currently adds a player home to Blackreach. House can be found somewhere around the large falmer city. In future additions I plan on including a quest line taking place that will be tied to a new guild. DAWNGUARD REQUIRED. New faction in blackreach created.",
  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATED TO VERSION 1.5\r<br />\r<br />YOU WILL NEED DAWNGUARD TO MAKE THIS MOD WORK. \r<br />\r<br />BUG FIX\r<br />Snow Elf members voice&#39;s changed to make all compatible as followers. \r<br />\r<br />ABOUT\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds new areas into blackreach as well as more mining locations and more enemies. Areas included are a new player home equipped with a teleport spell and a fast travel marker in Skyrim. Also adds a new hideout where snow elves can be found. If anyone wants to make a quest relating to the Falmer and the Snow Elves in Blackreach please message me, I wanted to do that with this quest but making a quest has not been successful from me yet and I don&#39;t really have time to mess with it.\r<br />\r<br />INCLUDES\r<br />\r<br />So far the mod adds in two new areas for the player to explore; A player home and a Snow Elf Hideout. The player home introduces two new spells for quick transport to the house as well as a summoned guardian. The snow elf hideout contains 9 new NPC&#39;s each of whom is unique and essential to the game. Seven of those NPC&#39;s can also be followers and a few can do something a little more. The hideout also contains a treasure of armors and weapons collected by the snow elves over their long years in the hideout surviving in Blackreach. The main Falmer City in Blackreach has also been updated to include more high level enemies and a few new characters from the Dawnguard DLC. Two Bandit camps are currently added. Feel free to run around and enjoy the fights for now&#33; \r<br />\r<br />CURRENT PROBLEMS\r<br />\r<br />The only thing that I&#39;ve found is that the snow elves when dismissed by the player as a follower sometimes won&#39;t make it back to the hideout in blackreach. To get around this just grab the teleport spell in the snow elf hideout and use that when you want to dismiss one of them. \r<br />\r<br />CURRENTLY ADDS\r<br />\r<br />2 spells\r<br />New Weapons and Armor\r<br />2 new locations\r<br />7 new followers some of which can do a little extra\r<br />2 new bandit camps\r<br />Falmer City Population increased\r<br />More soul gem mining areas\r<br />more enemies in blackreach city and placed throughout blackreach",
