  "summary": "Adds a fully functional, wearable, craftable, temperable version of Tsun\\'s Armor with working first person views to your world of skyrim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Originally made it for myself because I couldn\\'t find anything with working 1st person view of Tsun\\'s armor. 1st person has a really small, almost unnoticeable clipping issue where the body meets the hand, nothing too major. Works on all races, but not females. If you are looking for Tsun\\'s armor for your female character, I would recommend this one: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17298] CBEE Tsun Female Armor [/url]\r\nBut that\\'s about it. Same stats as its Steel plate. Fully craftable. Can be found under Steel section.\r\n\r\nNote: looks weird on a skinny character.",
