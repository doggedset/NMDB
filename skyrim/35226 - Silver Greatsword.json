  "summary": "A mesh replacement for the Silver Greatsword.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I was always bothered by how the silver greatsword was implemented.. it was basically just a large version of the silver sword. it felt boring and lazy, so I modified it to my own liking. I\\'ve decided to share it for whomever. It feels much more like a proper greatsword. Its much wider and about the same length.\r\n\r\nThe mesh is based off the silver sword, and edited in 3ds max.\r\nThe texture is the same as vanilla, so texture replacers work fine.\r\n\r\nI HIGHLY recommend aMidianBorn\\'s Book of Silence Weapon texture pack. it can be found here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24909\r\nhis pack includes a Hi-Res texture for the silver greatsword that is just outstanding.\r\n\r\nV1.1\r\nremoved .esp and textures as they were not needed.\r\n\r\nrequires:\r\nlatest 1.9 patch\r\n\r\nto install:\r\nRecommended: Use the NMM!\r\nor\r\nunzip and manually install the files.\r\n\r\ncompatibility:\r\nprobably wont work with any other mod that modifies the silver greatsword mesh!\r\n",
