The valley is accessible via mountain pass (the pass is located near Glenmoril - Falkreath Hold).\r<br />THIS IS A WIP, but I strongly suggest you to have a try on it, because in my opinion I created something completely unique. Check the mod features, then you will see ;)\r<br />\r<br />By the way, because of some problems (Creation Kit crashing a lot, etc etc.) I already stopped working to the project. Someone else will take care of it. So, if you&#39;d like to follow the progresses, or if you&#39;d like to help, please have a look at this discussion thread. :)[/size][/font][/b]\r<br />[url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/1788130-house-of-the-redguard-ii-official-mod-topic/page-5][size=4]Official Discussion Topic[/size]\r<br />[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#FF0000][font=Impact][size=6][center]- MOD FEATURES -[/center][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[list][*][b][font=Comic Sans MS][size=4]Only the manor itself took me some months of hard work: In order to create some meshes (expecially the house one and the manor walls), I had to combine hundreds of vanilla meshes.
