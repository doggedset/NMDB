The mod is RATHER USEFUL for harvesting alchemy reagants. Should a follower encounter trouble, while gathering, they will fight that trouble off, then start over, so don&#39;t worry too much if they aren&#39;t back in exactly 3 minutes, and don&#39;t feel obliged to wait, either. When you get far enough away, they&#39;ll finish other whatever gathering they have left and come find you.\r<br />The next time you talk to said follower, there will be an option to reset to their script &#34;Let&#39;s move on to another task.&#34; After that, the dialogue will close, and you can send them off again.\r<br />[b]===================================================\r<br />FEATURES AND CHANGES:\r<br />===================================================[/b]\r<br />- tweaked some things (9/25/2015)\r<br />- changed follower gather speed to a sprint (9/5/2015)\r<br />- Changed the dialog between you and your followers to be more colloquial. (8/8/2015)\r<br />- Changed the sandboxing and gathering radius to allow for more movement flexibility within an area (8/8/2015)\r<br />- Changed movement speed when sandboxing and gathering reagants to a jog so followers can cover more ground. This can lead to gathering a full page of reagants in an open area, and followers going offscreen into unrendered cells to find things.\r<br />- changed reagant gathering time to 3 minutes. Enough time for you to send your followers out, leave your computer, get a sandwich, come back and have a full inventory of brewing/cooking supplies.\r<br />- added cave and interior support for a follower&#39;s gathering ai. This can be used as a scouting mechanism of sorts if you want to enter a random cave and tell your follower to scan the area. They will very quickly set off hunting for items, taking on any hostiles they run into.\r<br />[b]====================================================\r<br />COMPATIBILITIES\r<br />====================================================[/b]\r<br />- vanilla followers\r<br />- multiple followers lite (steam workshop)\r<br />- AFT (with follower sandboxing turned off)\r<br />- Master Alchemist Extras (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34815/?\r<br />Do not use with kuertee&#39;s Simple Multiple Followers or EFF (you have been warned)\r<br />====================================================\r<br />HOW TO INSTALL:\r<br />====================================================\r<br />THIS MOD IS A REPLACER FOR THE ORIGINAL &#34;Followers Can Relax&#34;. Simply overwrite it and you should be fine.\r<br />1. extract the included data folder to your skyrim data directory\r<br />2. set last in the load order after other follower mods\r<br />[b]====================================================\r<br />CREDITS\r<br />====================================================[/b]\r<br />Afro/ArwingXL - editing a 3 year old mod\r<br />KingCoin - for the original &#39;Followers Can Relax&#39; - http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9504/?",
