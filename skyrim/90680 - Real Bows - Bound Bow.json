  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3]Real Bows by DecimusMaximus is an amazing mod, but I've always HATED the fact that the Bound Bow (which happens to be the bow I use the most) is not covered by the mod.  So I finally decided to get my feet wet and dive into the arcane labyrinth that is Nifskope and take care of it myself.\n<br />\n<br />So here we are.  This is just a simple mesh replacer for the bound bow that replaces it with the Daedric bow from Real Bows, complete with the usual visual effects of bound weapons.  And yes, you DO still need to install Real Bows, this is just a single mesh that replaces the Bound Bow mesh and does NOT include any textures or change any of the other bows.\n<br />\n<br />Original mod can be found here:  https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64440/[/size]",
