  "descriptionHtml": "This mod replaces Masser and Secunda to be a pair of beautiful high resolution galaxy\\'s, they look absolutely stunning in the night sky, especially with a few extra mods which also enhance the night sky.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the nexus mod manager doesnt install this mod correctly (Im assuming it wont because... well... its nexus.) then follow these instructions \r\nVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV\r\nTo install, just drag and drop all files into this directory \r\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\Textures\\\\sky\r\n\r\nA long while ago i downloaded the mod \\\"Starry nights\\\" i loved it, the only on tthing that bugged me was the fact that the 7 moon replacements would alternate throughout each day, so i deleted the ones i didnt like and kept the two i did like. I kept it like that for about 6 months, then i thought that it would be a good idea to upload it to Nexus for everyone else to enjoy :D \r\n\r\nSome great mods that work fantastically in conjunction: \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25022//?\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15707//?\r\n\r\nAnd of course the mod which i got the two moon assets from, Starry nights by Ironman5000, this mod adds an astonishing starry sky which twinkles, and optionally 7 moon replacements.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24668//?",
