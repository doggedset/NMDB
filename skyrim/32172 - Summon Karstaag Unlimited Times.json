  "modName": "Summon Karstaag Unlimited Times",
  "summary": "Lets you summon Karstaag once a day as many times as you want.",
  "descriptionHtml": "You can summon Odahviing unlimited times once you finish the main quest of the main game, or Durnehviir once you get his ability in Dawnguard. But if you unlock Karstaag, you cannot use him many times. You are limited to three total, as Bethesda intended.\r\n\r\nSure, Karstaag is very powerful, being level 90, but chances are with only three uses of the spell, you will probably never use him. If you could summon him unlimited times, but with a limit of once a day, his usefulness exponentially increases. \r\n\r\nThis mod simply changes the amount of times from three to infinite. Even if you have used the power once or twice, you will still be able to summon Karstaag unlimited more times. Unfortunately if you have used the ability all three times, you will not suddenly get the power back.\r\n\r\nObviously, this mod requires you to have Dragonborn and to have finished the Glacial Cave to legitimately get the power.",
