  "descriptionHtml": "[center][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8202/?][color=#0066cc][size=5][u]SSE Version Available Here[/u][/size][/color][/url][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This is a single .esp version of Crown Helmets by pnkrd made with permissions.\r<br />\r<br />Installation: Drag the CraftableCrownHelmets.esp into your data folder and check itÂ in the mod manager or launcher data files. \r<br />\r<br />NOTE: This does require pnkrd&#39;s original mod for the meshes as it is only the combined .esp file. Download the All in One file on pnkrd&#39;s page at http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5803 and install only the meshes folder. \r<br />DO NOT INSTALL PNKRD&#39;S .ESP&#39;s&#33;&#33; [It&#39;s called Crown Helmets_AIO_2_5A]\r<br />\r<br />This will work with any texture replacers for Daedric, Glass, Dragon Plate, Dragonscale, Elven and Ebony helmets. \r<br />\r<br />Also I have, at my husband&#39;s request, enabled these to work on all beast races. There is some clipping but they actually, in our opinions, look neat.\r<br />\r<br />Anyway, enjoy. ^_^\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Changing from many to one:\r<br />   Unfortunately this is going to require you to do a clean save (I&#39;m sorry but there is no way around it and I know this means you&#39;ll likely lose some nifty enchanted legendary crown, I did, but this is the only way.)\r<br />\r<br />Clean Save: 1)Drop all crown&#39;s from inventory (and followers if they are using them just to be safe)\r<br />    2)Save game\r<br />    3)Quit and disable pnkrd&#39;s .esp&#39;s (there are 6 in all)\r<br />    4)Reload character and save again, then quit (I&#39;m told quitting to desktop makes sure that each save is as clean as possible)\r<br />    5)Repeat for all character saves\r<br />    6)Enable CraftableCrownHelmets.esp\r<br />    7)Launch game again and remake nifty crown you lost (Again, so sorry about that&#33;)\r<br />          \r<br />\r<br />Uninstallation:  1)Drop all crown&#39;s from inventory (and followers if they are using them just to be safe)\r<br />         2)Save game\r<br />         3)Quit and disable CraftableCrownHelmets.esp\r<br />         4)Reload character and save again, then quit (I&#39;m told quitting to desktop makes sure that each save is as clean as possible)\r<br />         5)Repeat for all character saves\r<br />\r<br />Delete CraftableCrownHelmets.esp and the following meshes:\r<br />\r<br />meshes/armor/daedric/daedriccrownf_0.nif\r<br />meshes/armor/daedric/daedriccrownf_1.nif\r<br />meshes/armor/daedric/daedriccrownm_0.nif\r<br />meshes/armor/daedric/daedriccrownm_1.nif\r<br />\r<br />meshes/armor/dragonbone/dragonbonecrownf_0.nif\r<br />meshes/armor/dragonbone/dragonbonecrownf_1.nif\r<br />meshes/armor/dragonbone/dragonbonecrownm_0.nif\r<br />meshes/armor/dragonbone/dragonbonecrownm_1.nif\r<br />\r<br />meshes/armor/dragonscale/dragonscalecrownf.nif\r<br />meshes/armor/dragonscale/dragonscalecrownm_0.nif\r<br />meshes/armor/dragonscale/dragonscalecrownm_1.nif\r<br />\r<br />meshes/armor/ebony/f/crown_0.nif\r<br />meshes/armor/ebony/f/crown_1.nif\r<br />meshes/armor/ebony/m/crown_0.nif\r<br />meshes/armor/ebony/m/crown_1.nif\r<br />\r<br />meshes/armor/elven/f/crown_0.nif\r<br />meshes/armor/elven/f/crown_1.nif\r<br />meshes/armor/elven/m/crownM_0.nif\r<br />meshes/armor/elven/m/crownM_1.nif\r<br />\r<br />meshes/armor/glass/f/crown_0.nif\r<br />meshes/armor/glass/f/crown_1.nif\r<br />meshes/armor/glass/m/crown_0.nif\r<br />meshes/armor/glass/m/crown_1.nif\r<br />\r<br />Thanks and enjoy and don&#39;t forget to endorse pnkrd&#39;s mod as it is the original it deserves the credit&#33; I just compiled his wonderful work since I love them all&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Cyrusfyre/Seidon\r<br />\r<br />Permissions\r<br />I was given permission to upload this by pnkrd and as such any uses of the materials herein are subject to his consent.
