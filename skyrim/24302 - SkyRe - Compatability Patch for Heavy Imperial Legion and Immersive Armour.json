  "descriptionHtml": "This is my very first mod with the Creation Kit, so be gentle!\r\n\r\n================\r\nDetails\r\n================\r\n\r\nThis is a small compatibility patch to get Immersive Armours for Skyrim Redone working with Heavy Imperial Legion. Specifically, the Imperial Captain at the start of the game (the one who handles your impending execution) was wearing the Immersive Armour set whilst all the other Legionaries were wearing Witcher 2-style plate armour. The Heavy Imperial Legion mod does contain an armour set for her, but it was being overwritten by Immersive Armours. This patch corrects that and the good captain will again wear her heavy plate armour.\r\n\r\n================\r\nRequirements\r\n================\r\n\r\nImmersive Armors by hothtrooper44 - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19733 (assets only)\r\nImmersive Armors for SkyRe by tortugapir8 - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21269\r\nHeavy Oblivion Style Witcher Plated Imperial Soldiers by Das_Reich aka Quad - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16130\r\n\r\n================\r\nInstallation\r\n================\r\n\r\nDownload & install with NMM, or manually extract to your date folder. The only file is SkyRe_Plugin_ImmersiveHeavyLegion.esp\r\n\r\nVERY IMPORTANT:\r\n\r\nLoad both HeavyImperialLegion.esp and SkyRe_Plugin_ImmersiveHeavyLegion.esp AFTER your bashed patch, or this won\\'t work. Load my compatibility patch after HeavyImperialLegion.esp\r\n\r\n================\r\nUninstallation\r\n================\r\n\r\nUninstall via NMM, or simply delete SkyRe_Plugin_ImmersiveHeavyLegion.esp from the Data folder.",
