  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;ve crept on this site for what seems like forever and now I&#39;m finally putting out my first (and very simple) mod.\r<br />\r<br />I like my game to feel as realistic as possible and I find it difficult to imagine my skinny Nord girl running around fighting Dragons while packing 50 potions and 7 sets of armor.\r<br />Using console commands or other mods to change carry weight works... until you start building into stamina, which if you are like me then you run combat mods and NEED that stamina.\r<br />I waited to see if anyone else would do this mod but got tired of waiting.\r<br />\r<br />The only thing this does is change the &#34;carryweightperlvl&#34; from 5 to 0, so it should have no compatibility issues to speak of.\r<br />\r<br />Recommend using this with a low carry weight (I use 65) and mods that add pouches and packs.",
