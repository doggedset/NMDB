Work station texture features a texture with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/34444-1-1365241338.jpg]removed beveled veins[/url] as I personally think the vanilla workstation one did not make sense.\r<br />[/center][size=3][b]Special Notes:[/b][/size]\r<br />Some of textures for this mod are uncompressed and is in the format of A8R8B8G8/32 Bits Per Pixel and is this was done for a reason as when compressed to other formats such as DXT1 and DXT5 the molten lava look on objects such as hardwood generates a lot of noise thus when saving in compressed formats, it&#39;s just the glowmaps look a lot smoother and less contricted and saturated with noise.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Installing:[/b][/size]\r<br />Choose a replacer from a directory and copy the &#34;Data&#92;&#34; folder provided in the archive to your\r<br />Skyrim&#92;Data directory.\r<br />\r<br />Overwrite any other files when prompted.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Uninstalling:[/b][/size]\r<br />Trace back to the contents of the archive and delete what you have previously added to your Skyrim&#92;Data directory.",
