  "descriptionHtml": "Have you always wanted a BYO voice pack from games like Team Fortress 2, but didn&#39;t know how to do it? No worries, I made it for you - all 9 classes + 1 special &#34;Michael Rosen&#34; to spice your game up a little. You will need the core mod of course: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72039/?\r<br />\r<br />Installation: \r<br />I&#39;m sure you know where to put the folder, but in case: Skyrim&#92;Data&#92;sound&#92;fx\r<br />\r<br />Greeting Function:\r<br />Functions like HELLO, GOODBYE and RANDOM work differently here. Just like in tf2, they are used as Positive, Negative and Taunt. I recommend you to bind keys to them. I was also trying to make them as lore-friendly as possible.\r<br />\r<br />Hello - Negative Response (tap the key when there is something you don&#39;t like e.g. boss fight, loot, corpses, room, events...)\r<br />Goodbye - Positive Response (tap the key when there is something you like e.g. finished quest, cleared dungeon, loot, events...)\r<br />Random - Taunt (tap the key when you are in a fight with an enemy, taunting them like they do you)\r<br />\r<br />If you don&#39;t like any particular sound, you can delete it or edit it. If you want to suggest something to change or suggest other games&#39; voice packs to make, please do so.\r<br />\r<br />Be sure to endorse the core mod: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72039/?\r<br />\r<br />Uploaded with HHaleyy&#39;s permission.",
