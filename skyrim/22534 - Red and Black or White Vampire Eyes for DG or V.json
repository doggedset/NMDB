  "descriptionHtml": "Wow, over 2000 downloads, thank you so much everyone! :)\r\n\r\nI didn't like having big glowing yellow/amber eyes, and I've always loved the idea of having red eyes as a vampire, so i got a picture of an eye, shrunk it to the size of the original eye texture, and then a tiny bit more as the iris was just a tad big for popular taste, and colored and darkened it accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe red eyes are not too bright which i didn't like and also are not so dark the glow is not visible, I hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\nv1: Uploaded large red iris.\r\nv2: Shrunk iris a little bit more and darkened around eye a bit.\r\nv3: Slightly edited original black/red eye and added red iris with white eye.\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\nUnzip the folder and pick whether you would like the red iris with a black or white eye and move the textures folder into the Data folder of your skyrim dir eg \"c:/whatever/skyrim folder/Data\" and overwrite if necessary necessary.\r\n\r\nENJOY! :)",
