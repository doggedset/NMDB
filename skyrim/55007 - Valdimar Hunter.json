  "summary": "Changes the Hearthfire Housecarl from Morthal to an Imperial Archer, coming with new stats and a new name.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Another part of the HRP, this one changes the Hjaalmarch Housecarl, Valdimar, to an Imperial Hunter. As always, if you want to keep the old Housecarl but with new equipment and skills, download the alternative version.\r<br />\r<br />Details: Changes Valdimar&#39;s class to the Blade Class, making him better at Archery, Sneak and Light Armor. Also changes his equipment to a full Fur Armor and provides him with an Imperial Bow. Also, if you like it, it will change his race to an Imperial.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements: Hearthfire is all unless you want him to have the alternate bow positioning. If you do want that, look here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50096/?\r<br />\r<br />Bugs: The Grey Face Bug is likely to occur when activating this mod after first encountering the Housecarl. So either use this on a save file in which you haven&#39;t encountered the affected NPC, or hope a more experienced modder comes up with a solution.\r<br />\r<br />Installation: simply drag and drop the files into the Data folder and activate the .esp.\r<br />\r<br />Load Order: as low as possible, especially if you have any other mods running that alter Valdimar&#39;s appearance.\r<br />\r<br />P.S., feel free to take screenshots of Valdimar whilst running this mod and send them to me, I might add the pictures to the file. Also, if you want any other followers altered, send me a message, I enjoy doing this.\r<br />\r<br />Permissions: If you want to have the file changed, just send me a message and what you want changed, and I&#39;ll probably give permission or do it myself.
