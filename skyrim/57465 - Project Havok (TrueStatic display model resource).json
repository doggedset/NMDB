  "summary": "Project Havok&#33; is a modder resource providing many &#34;TrueStatic&#34; models for display uses",
  "descriptionHtml": "You&#39;ve been there; clicked the &#34;Don&#39;t havok settle&#34; button, attached the &#34;DisableHavokOnLoad&#34; script with all the right options but your stuff keeps jumping off the freaking walls&#33; right? well no more. That ghost who knocks stuff around seemingly randomly despite your efforts has been busted&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Project Havok&#33; is a project designed to provide &#34;TrueStatic&#34; models of weapons and armor to display in your mod which does not require any Creation Kit havok management in the CK. These models are true static object that have standard collision but will not settle under any circumstances (hopefully). In addition, not including any Havok management scripting will significantly enhance your cell load speed (if you had a large number of displays previously coded for no havok)\r<br />\r<br />Included are dozens of models from Vanilla and DLC expansions as well as my own custom &#34;mash up&#34; static models for displays of weapons and armor and jewelry, etc. These are designed to be used as containers or can just be used as nice static scenery\r<br />\r<br />I plan on updating this resource at a later time with additional models\r<br />\r<br />Note: The Bow Rack currently only has a quiver and bolt quiver because merging over the skinned versions of bows is tricky business. So you can use the standard havok management to create static versions of bows in the CK to fill up the rack manually and it should work fine given the fact that you don&#39;t need any havok management on the rest of your displays any longer.\r<br />\r<br />Come see this setup in use as created for my main mod: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52248/?]Legacy of the Dragonborn (Dragonborn Gallery)\r<br />[/url]",
