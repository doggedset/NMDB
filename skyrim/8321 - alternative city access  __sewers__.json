  "descriptionHtml": "alternativeCityAccess\r\n=================\r\n\r\nI made this for my own game-play, cause it always felt strange, when I sneaked the guards at the main-gates. Now, sharing it with you may make one, or another happy ;)\r\n\r\nthis mod makes the sewers of the cities access-able ...well it does that for Winterrun, Riften & Markarth, since Windhelm & Solitude are lacking of a visible sewer-\\\"entrance\\\". However, I leaved Solidude as it is, because the \\\"Dock Entrance\\\" pretty much does the job in my eyes. In Windhelm I decided to make some kind of an own-access just to have one there too. I realise, there are some other ways to get hidden access, as the player makes progress in the quests, but I wanted this to fit some clich√© (you know like crouching through the sewers silently & so on;)\r\n\r\nHow to use:\r\n=========\r\n\r\nlook at the images! the bigger entrances are automated(like caves, just walk to the iron rods - one of them must be detachable!!! =P). The smaller ones work just as doors, by clicking.\r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\n==========\r\n\r\n-this mod is NOT compatible with the open-cities-mod\r\n-may be not compatible with any mod, that alters the cities in the zones, the exits are\r\n\r\nIssues:\r\n=====\r\n\r\nfollowers path-finding in Whiterun is still not satisfying, but as there are some bugs in the CK, fixing this has to wait\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n=======\r\n\r\nas usual, just copy the alternativeCityAccess_1.0.esp into your data folder & make sure the plugin is checked in your preferred mod-manager, or default-launcher (the dl & install should work with NMM too, let me know, if I\\'m wrong on this).\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\n=========\r\n\r\noff with that .esp!! :)\r\n\r\nChange-log:\r\n=========\r\n\r\nv1.2 fixed companion issue (I\\'m sorry:NOT fixed yet)\r\nv1.1 new exit in Markarth\r\nv1.0 initial release\r\n\r\n\r\nv1.2 -fixed the companion-issue. Now, they will follow you though the sewers. \r\n-changed the spawn-point for Whiterun-entrance from upper to lower town. This is because the companions have problems to exit the streambed in upper part of town. they still will follow you through upper exit\r\n-added some navmeshes to give companion better possibility to reach the roads in Whiterun\r\n-the file-name still contains the version-number, my fault & I\\'m sorry. But that doesn\\'t change anything for you at all. (Just sorters like BOSS etc. may not recognize it, don\\'t know yet)\r\n\r\nTHE CK-NAVMESH-BUG IS STILL MAKING IT WORK NOT PROPERLY & I DON\\'T WANT TO CHANGE IT INTO A MASTER, AS IT HAS TO BE LOADED AFTER OTHER MODS, THAT ALTERS THE CITY (IN MOST CASES & I KNOW TOO LITTLE ABOUT IT YET), THEREFORE IT\\'S STILL NOT RECOMMENDED BO BE USED WITH FOLLOWERS!!! I APOLOGIZE\r\n\r\nif you should face some problems, please let me know. I\\'ve tested it with Lydia in all 4 cities.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n=====\r\n\r\nyou can do with it, what you want, as long as i get the credits, for what I\\'ve done (if you let\\'s say implement & release it).\r\n\r\nThis is my first release & English is not my native language so be kind with me ;)\r\n\r\nhave fun with it!\r\n\r\nd0p4m1n",
