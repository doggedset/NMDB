  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6][b]Remodding Skyrim[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Since I started modding with Oblivion, I have always remodded from scratch. I remod Skyrim around every month or so. \n<br />\n<br />Some of you may be wondering why I did this guide. One modder I spoke with had not remodded Skyrim in over a year. Another modder...over 3 years. Both were afraid that remodding Skyrim would take them weeks or months...and so I wrote this short little guide on how to be able to delete your Skyrim folder, paste in a tweaked Skyrim folder, and be up and running in only an hour or two!\n<br />\n<br />These are the methods I use to make things faster and easier for myself. \n<br />\n<br />You are of course free to do things however you want or change stuff to whatever works best for you.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=5][b]Phase 1: Planning[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]01. Plan your remodded Skyrim with a Notepad text file, example 01-01-18 ModList.txt.\n<br />02. Plan ahead by reading description pages and determining install order and requirements.\n<br />03. Make sure you include ini changes from ENB, USLEEP, grass mod, etc. in your tweaked Skyrim.ini and SkyrimPrefs.ini.\n<br />04. The ENB changes to your [size=4]Skyrim.ini and SkyrimPrefs.ini[/size] are [i]usually[/i] the same for every ENB.\n<br />05. Create sections based on the way you plan to remod Skyrim.\n<br />06. Think of this as a checklist to make sure that you remember everything.\n<br />07. Doing this saves time and makes replanning and remodding faster in the future.\n<br />08. Create a folder named MODS or similar with a folder for each of your sections where you can store your mods, settings, etc.\n<br />09. I actually start modding around section 13 or 14 since everything else is in my Tweaked Skyrim backup.\n<br />10. Sections below are what currently work for me, customize as needed.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />~01-01-18 ModList.txt~\n<br />01. Skyrim\n<br />02. Nvidia\n<br />03. Mod Organizer\n<br />04. SKSE\n<br />05. LOOT\n<br />06. TES5Edit\n<br />07. Wrye Bash\n<br />08. PoserDataGen\n<br />09. DynDOLOD\n<br />10. ESM\n<br />11. INI\n<br />12. BAT\n<br />13. ENB\n<br />14. Patches\n<br />15.

Items\n<br />27. Creatures\n<br />28. Dragons\n<br />29. Hair\n<br />30. Eyes\n<br />31. Males\n<br />32. Children\n<br />33. NPCs\n<br />34. Skeleton\n<br />35. HDT\n<br />36. Armors\n<br />37.

DynDOLOD Textures\n<br />55. DynDOLOD Output\n<br />56. OTHER\n<br />\n<br />It is important to note that this is just MY install order that I do by section. \n<br />\n<br />Depending on what mods you use, yours may be different. \n<br />\n<br />Always allow LOOT to determine your load order.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This is what a few sections from my 01-01-18 ModList.txt look like:\n<br />===========================================================\n<br />~23. Water~\n<br />Realistic_Water_Two_2K_by_isoku.rar[/size]\n<br />[size=4][size=4]===========================================================\n<br />[/size]~24. Sky~\n<br />Watch_the_Skies_Traveller_v9_by_VariousArtists.rar[/size]\n<br />[size=4][size=4]===========================================================\n<br />[/size]~25. Tweaks~\n<br />Better_Jumping_by_meh321.rar\n<br />Dawnguard_and_Clan_Volkihar_Epilogues_by_SkyLover264_and_Kelsenellenelvian.rar\n<br />Electrify_2K_by_ramccoid.rar\n<br />Infinite_Gold_for_Merchants_by_Dave_Kurtz.rar\n<br />Just_Give_Up_Already_by_HorribleAndy.rar\n<br />No_More_Radial_Blur_by_Gorgulla.rar\n<br />Particle_Field_by_Keung.rar\n<br />Random_Vampire_Attacks_in_Towns_Disabled_by_Quarn.rar\n<br />Skyrim_Weather_Control_by_LegoManIAm94.rar\n<br />Smart_Souls_by_shadeMe.rar\n<br />Teach_Followers_Spells_Through_Spell_Tomes_by_cloudedtruth.rar\n<br />Thieves_Guild_Requirements_v30_by_kryptopyr.rar\n<br />Uninterrupted_Invisibility_by_meh321.rar\n<br />===========================================================\n<br />I kind of got lazy not putting the version numbers in, but you get the idea! :P[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Phase 2: Tweaked Skyrim Backup[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]The next thing I do that saves time is backup the entire Skyrim folder. Many modders do this and it's not really a new trick. Difference with mine is that my backup already includes MO standalone installed, already tweaked with all the tools and trimmings and ready to rock. I use standalone versions for MO, LOOT, TES5Edit, Wrye Bash, PoserDataGen, and DynDOLOD...everything standalone. The three SKSE files and SKSE Plugin Preloader (for Crash Fixes) and my BAT files already in there. The only ones I do not do are FNIS and BodySlide since they need to be installed later in my mod list. Sometimes I will even leave an ENB preinstalled and already tweaked for myself.\n<br />\n<br />Doing this allows you to delete old Skyrim folder, copy and paste in TWEAKED Skyrim folder.\n<br />\n<br />Start modding with USLEEP and Unofficial High Resolution Patch right away.\n<br />\n<br />So from vanilla Skyrim:\n<br />\n<br />01. Backup vanilla Skyrim and vanilla Skyrim ini settings.\n<br />02. Install Mod Organizer standalone, tweak settings as desired.\n<br />03. Tweak your Skyrim.ini and SkyrimPrefs.ini, save tweaked ini's backup to a folder with date.\n<br />04. Save screen captures of all of your Nvidia or AMD settings.\n<br />05. Install and configure SKSE and SKSE.ini if needed.\n<br />06. Create an SKSE archive you can install as a mod in MO to save time. \n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Data[size=4]&#92;[/size]scripts[/size]\n<br />Data[size=4]&#92;[/size] SKSE[size=4]&#92;[/size]SKSE.ini (if you use it)\n<br />\n<br />Right click on Data and select add to archive.\n<br />Name the archive SKSE_Scripts.rar\n<br />Install as the very first mod in your install order\n<br />\n<br />07. Install SKSE Plugin Preloader if you plan to use Crash Fixes.\n<br />08. Preconfigure your CrashFixPlugin.ini and rearchive with the tweaked ini.\n<br />\n<br />Crash_Fixes_by_meh321.rar\n<br />\n<br />09. Install LOOT standalone, usually the \"dev\" developer version.\n<br />10. Install TES5Edit standalone.\n<br />11. Install Wrye Bash standalone.\n<br />12. Put PoserDataGen folder in Skyrim folder.\n<br />13. Put DynDOLOD folder in Skyrim folder, tweak DynDOLOD_TES5.ini if needed.\n<br />\n<br />DynDOLOD&#92;Edit Scripts&#92;DynDOLOD&#92;DynDOLOD_TES5.ini in notepad and set TreeLOD=1 (for normal LODs)\n<br />DynDOLOD&#92;Edit Scripts&#92;DynDOLOD&#92;DynDOLOD_TES5.ini in notepad and set TreeLOD=0 (for 3D LODs)\n<br />\n<br />14. Create shortcuts in MO for SKSE, LOOT, TES5Edit, and Wrye Bash for now.\n<br />15. Clean esm's with TES5Edit and save backups.\n<br />16. Run LOOT at least once so LOOT updates masterlist and checks esm's.\n<br />17. [size=4]Make sure you add your tweaked ini's into Documents&#92;My Games&#92;Skyrim [/size]and also:\n<br />\n<br />D:&#92;STEAM&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim&#92;ModOrganizer&#92;profiles&#92;Default\n<br />\n<br />18. [size=4]Back up your Skyrim folders from:[/size]\n<br />\n<br />C:&#92;Users&#92;ShmooZ&#92;AppData&#92;Local&#92;Skyrim\n<br />C:&#92;Users&#92;ShmooZ&#92;Documents&#92;My Games&#92;Skyrim\n<br />\n<br />19. Create a new folder named TWEAKED or similar.\n<br />20. Save the entire Skyrim folder from D:&#92;STEAM&#92;steamapps&#92;common to TWEAKED folder.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=5][b]Phase 3: ENB Drops[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Create a drop for every ENB you use. For example in my Rudy Vanilla ENB drop I have: \n<br />\n<br />01. Tweaked enbseries files in enbseries folder\n<br />02. d3d9.dll (currently 319 binaries)\n<br />03. enbhost.exe (currently 319 binaries)\n<br />04. Tweaked enblocal.ini\n<br />05. Tweaked enbseries.ini\n<br />\n<br />You can also save separate drops in a folder with the date, totally up to you.\n<br />\n<br />When ready, I can just drag and drop from my Rudy Vanilla 319 folder on my C drive into my Skyrim folder on my D drive. To uninstall Rudy Vanilla 319, I just drag and drop again so that all the files and folders are highlighted in my Skyrim folder. Right click on highlighted files and folders and delete. If you only have one drive then copy and paste instead of dragging and dropping.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=5][b]Phase 4: Combining, Rearchiving and Renaming[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]01. Extract mod archive parts and combine into one mod by premerging Data folders in the correct order.\n<br />02. Rearchive mod and rename with version number and mod author.\n<br />03. For example, Noble_Skyrim_2K_v530_by_Shutt3r.rar\n<br />04. The underscores allow the entire mod name to be seen in MO.\n<br />05. Some mods do not have a Data folder and will only contain .esp, meshes, textures, etc.\n<br />06. All these can safely go inside the Data folder even if it is currently non-existent.\n<br />07. You can also combine similar texture mods.\n<br />08. For example I have a mod archive which contains all my plants, flowers, ivy, etc. textures and meshes.\n<br />09. So instead of installing over 25 individual plant and flower mods, I only need to install one.\n<br />10. Keep backups of older mod archive combinations just in case something does not work right or you don't like your most recent changes.\n<br />\n<br />[b]WARNING![/b]\n<br />\n<br />It is important to know that there are certain mods you should never rename or rearchive. BodySlide and Outfit Studio, and also XPMSE come to mind.\n<br />\n<br />You may want to keep backups of the original mod archives with version numbers and mod authors so that you can easily go back to the separate version, find the mod on Nexus again and update if needed.\n<br />\n<br />Do NOT combine different armor mods from different authors! Rustic_Forsworn_by_Gamwich.rar can safely be combined with Rustic_Clothing_by_Gamwich.rar, since they are all just textures.\n<br />\n<br />Start with a few mods per remod. Try to think of what takes you the longest to install and start there.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]DynDOLOD[/b]\n<br />\n<br />If you use the same exact mods for trees, mountains, landscape, and architecture, etc. every single time you remod, then you can save your DynDOLOD_Textures.rar and DynDOLOD_Output.rar and use them for future remods.\n<br />\n<br />This alone can save you at least 20 to 30 minutes!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]BodySlide - XML Preset[/b]\n<br />\n<br />If you use the same body (shape) meshes, and BodySlide preset everytime you mod, then just save your body shape to a .xml file by selecting save as - at the top left. Choose your desktop or some other convenient location, since saving to where it actually needs to go causes it to disappear!\n<br />\n<br />Use a name for your .xml that has zeroes so that it is automatically the first one you see in BodySlide:\n<br />\n<br />000 Juicy UUNP - 7B Bombshell.xml\n<br />\n<br />Drop your saved .xml file into:\n<br />\n<br />D:&#92;STEAM&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim&#92;ModOrganizer&#92;mods&#92;BodySlide and Outfit Studio&#92;CalienteTools&#92;BodySlide&#92;SliderPresets\n<br />\n<br />Or make into a mod archive:\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Data&#92;CalienteTools&#92;BodySlide&#92;SliderPresets[/size]\n<br />\n<br />Create a backup.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]BodySlide - Body and Armor Meshes[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Then once you batch build your armors and install BodySlide Presets, you can retrieve your body shape meshes from:\n<br />\n<br />D:&#92;STEAM&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim&#92;ModOrganizer&#92;mods&#92;BodySlide Presets&#92;meshes&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;character assets\n<br />\n<br />These six meshes can be used to reshape your NPCs, for example:\n<br />\n<br />D:&#92;STEAM&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim&#92;ModOrganizer&#92;mods&#92;Bijin NPCs by rxkx22 &#92;meshes&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;Bijin NPCs\n<br />\n<br />You can just copy and paste them right in there and then rearchive your custom shaped NPC mod with a new name! :)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]FOMODS[/b]\n<br />\n<br />If you extract a mod and it has a FOMOD archive, you can do a \"ghost install\" of the mod in MO, go to Skyrim&#92;Mod Organizer&#92;mods folder, copy the meshes and textures folders along with any .esp. Paste into a new folder named Data. You should not put meta.ini in new archives. Rearchive and rename as desired.\n<br />\n<br />Then uninstall the ghost install and reinstall the new renamed archive so you can skip FOMOD installation in the future.\n<br />\n<br />Only FOMODs I still use are BodySlide and XPMSE. I have created a simplified installation for every other FOMOD mod archive I use.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]BSA's[/b]\n<br />\n<br />BSA archives can be extracted and rearchived. However, you will find that certain mods such as Unofficial patches and Books of Skyrim work better when kept in there original bsa archives. For this reason, I cannot recommend always extracting bsa archives. \n<br />\n<br />There are certain situations where extracting may be preferable, such as with an armor for example. Loose files will overwrite textures in a bsa archive anyway, such as an armor retexture for example. You can still rename by putting the bsa, bsl, esm, or esp in a Data folder, rename with the version number and mod author, and rearchive.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Final Words[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Currently, I have only 330 mods installed. Last time I checked it was well over 500 actual mod archives.\n<br />\n<br />I spend about a week or two planning a remod in my Modlist.txt\n<br />\n<br />Then I remod Skyrim with over 500 mods in only an hour or two.\n<br />\n<br />When I reinstall Windows, I do a fresh install of Steam and create a fresh new Tweaked Skyrim.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />That's it!\n<br />\n<br />Watch the skies traveller! :P[/size]",
