Anyone here on the Nexus has my full permission to modify/fix and reupload this mod (as long as you make changes to the original mod).[/b]\r\n[center][img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/34513-1-1365326077.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[b]WANT SOMETHING COOLER? CHECK OUT MY [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34562]BLOOD FROM A STONE[/url] MOD.[/b]\r\n\r\nThe blood potions added in Dawnguard are too few and far between (I\\'ve only ever seen like, one of \\'em), and finding a blood supply can be annoying (I mean you COULD just fast travel to Castle Volkihar, but screw that), so I looked for a mod that allows you to create your own.\r\n\r\nI found two, one of which requires venison and salt, and another which requires human hearts or flesh. The first one\\'s okay I guess, but I\\'ve got the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32598/]Heart Breaker[/url] mod, so I usually end up with a few dozen Human Hearts in my pockets. I figured, \\\"Why can\\'t I just squeeze the blood from the hearts into a bottle?\\\"\r\n\r\nWell now you can (or rather, you can take a bunch of hearts to a cooking pot and craft the blood potion there, because crafting options in Skyrim are kind of restrictive)! I mean, there was already a mod that let you do exactly that, but this one\\'s got a compatibility patch for Heart Breaker, which lets you use the Elf, Argonian, Orc, and Kahjiit hearts from HB 1.1 to create blood potions, so I\\'d say mine\\'s better (oh, and that dude\\'s not going to update his mod anymore, whereas I *might* add some other stuff to this, if I can think of anything cool and useful that would fit this mod).\r\n[/center]\r\nThere are 2 files:\r\nCraftableBloodPotions.esp\r\n--The base mod. Requires Dawnguard.\r\n--Allows you to create a Potion of Blood at a cooking pot from Human Hearts or Human Flesh\r\n\r\nCraftableBloodPotions - Heart Breaker Compatibility Patch.esp\r\n--The Heart Breaker compatibility patch. Requires Dawnguard, Heart Breaker, CraftableBloodPotions.esp and Dragonborn (only because Heart Breaker requires it).\r\n--Adds the ability to create a Potion of Blood at a cooking pot from the Elf, Orc, Argonian, and Kahjiit Hearts from Heart Breaker 1.1\r\n\r\nCurrently there are no known incompatibilities, and there shouldn\\'t ever be any.",
