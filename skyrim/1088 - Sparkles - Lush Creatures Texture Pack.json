  "descriptionHtml": "[color=orange](Will be adding these updates to a new section in my mods called \\\"Changelog\\\". Keep an eye out) Update! We\\'re now partnered with the talented [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=3148513]Tytanis[/url], creator of some truly phenominal pre-Creation Kit stuff! Tytanis is most widely known for his great work on the [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1601]Tytanis - The Ultimate Mod - Crafts - Spells - Items - MORE[url] mod.[/color]\r\n\r\n[center][img=]http://img210.imageshack.us/img210/8074/sparkleslogosmall.png[/img]\r\nThis mod can be used alone, but it\\'s best when combined with:\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=521]Sparkles - Lush Environments[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1892]Sparkles - Lush Cities[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2515]Sparkles - Lush Dungeons[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=845]Sparkles - Lush Clutter[/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1636]Sparkles - Lush Characters and NPCs[/url]\r\n[/center]\r\n\r\n[u][b][color=#5078D4][size=3]Introduction (i.e Gloating Space)[/size][/color][/b][/u]\r\nSkyrim is home to an abundance of wildlife, but unfortunately (like many other aspects of Skyrim), they turn out to be rather dull. This texture mod will fix that problem for you! Not only will it take care of the dull bear blocking your path, but it\\'ll even do you the favor of spicing up that Fire Dragon who\\'s about to eat your face. From monsters to critters, fish to dragons... a new color scheme is on the rise! \r\n\r\nThis make-over is a work in progress, and I will soon be working on more textures for both the natural environment and structural things. If you have suggestions, comments or requests, be sure to drop me a line.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b][color=#5078D4][size=3]Which file is for me?[/size][/color][/b][/u]\r\n\r\n[u][b]==25% Contrast==[/b][/u]\r\nThis file will make your creatures have better shadows and highlights, while increasing the starkness of color ever so slightly. Use if you want to see a bit of a difference, but like more realism than lushness.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]==30% Saturation==[/b][/u]\r\nThis slight increase in color will barely be noticeable on some creatures, but will be notable on brighter colors. Use as an alternative to the realistic 25% Contrast file.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]==30% Sat, 25% Con (Recommended version)==[/b][/u]\r\nCreatures not only stand out now, they also look more colorful! The extra saturation in this file will make your favorite monster\\'s colors look much nicer. Use if you want the perfect balance of lushness.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]==50% Saturation==[/b][/u]\r\nThere\\'s not much to say about this file, most of it is up to you. It\\'ll make bright colors really colorful, and darker colors much nicer. Use if you don\\'t like any other files? xD\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b]==50% Sat, 25% Con==[/b][/u]\r\nSurprisingly, unlike most of my mods, this does not make a lot of textures gaudy. It will make a few go over the top, but it mostly makes very light colors noticeable. Use if you don\\'t mind some textures being really colorful, and want to see lighter colors become more present.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b][color=#5078D4][size=3]Installation[/size][/color][/b][/u]\r\nThis mod will not replace any default texture files themselves. See your physician for more details and use as directed.\r\n\r\n[b]1.[/b] Unzip this ZIP folder into your Skyrim \\\"Data\\\" directory. If you unzipped this folder into another place, just make sure the \\\"textures\\\" folder gets put into the Skyrim \\\"Data\\\" directory. On Vista, the Data folder is located here: C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\r\n[b]2.[/b] If you are asked to merge folders or overwrite files, press OK or YES.\r\n\r\n[b]3.[/b] Start the game, kill a goat or deer, and admire it\\'s shiny new dead skin.\r\n\r\n[b]4.[/b] If you like it, endorse it. The more people who know, the better it becomes!\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b][color=#5078D4][size=3]Uninstallation[/size][/color][/b][/u]\r\n\r\n[b]2.[/b] Navigate to your Skyrim Data directory, where you installed this pack to.\r\n\r\n[b]3.[/b] Go to \\\"textures\\\", and delete or rename \\\"actors\\\" to something else. This will uninstall the mod, and your creatures will be dull and sad once more.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b][color=#5078D4][size=3]Compatibility[/size][/color][/b][/u]\r\nThis pack should be compatible with all mods except other texture mods that use the \\\"actors\\\" folder. If you\\'re using mods that use the \\\"character\\\" folder, those should work just fine (even though they\\'re in \\\"actors\\\"). Of course, if you know what you\\'re doing, you can mix and match right?\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b][color=#5078D4][size=3]Injectors Vs. Texture Packs[/size][/color][/b][/u]\r\nThere\\'s not much to say on this subject, so I\\'ll just give you something to chew on. Injectors change the actual settings of the game, making it more lush... but at a cost. It can severely impact your system\\'s performance, and is basically the same as turning your graphics up to high (Or more, depending on your injector settings).\r\n\r\nTexture packs do not change any settings in the game, but rather they take advantage of Skyrim\\'s texture system. By default, Skyrim will use a packed .BSA (a high-tech ZIP file) file to retrieve it\\'s textures. However, if you create a folder called \\\"textures\\\" in the Data folder, it will take what textures it finds there and use them instead.\r\n\r\nThe nice thing about this is that Skyrim, like Oblivion, is programmed to use textures it cannot find in your \\\"texture\\\" folder, by accessing the .BSA. So you can basically add 1 new texture if you wanted, and as long as it was correctly named, Skyrim would only change that texture in-game.\r\n\r\nI\\'m not saying injectors are bad, but they\\'re probably not the best for most people.\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][b][color=#5078D4][size=3]Credits and Copyrights[/size][/color][/b][/u]\r\nFor all the fact that I created this mod, it wasn\\'t as difficult as it looks. It DID take me HOURS though, so if you plan on using the re-textured files that I spent so long improving, it would be nice to see some credit.\r\n\r\nI also accept treats.",
