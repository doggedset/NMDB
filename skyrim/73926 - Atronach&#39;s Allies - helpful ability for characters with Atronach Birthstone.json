  "descriptionHtml": "[b][size=6]Atronach&#39;s Allies\r<br />[size=4]a helpful ability for characters with Atronach Birthstone[/size][/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />This is a simple mod I made for my character, who was a mage born under the Atronach sign. I was using Kryptopyr&#39;s [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63354/?]Disparity[/url] mod, which makes the Atronach Birthsign work like in previous games, completely negating player&#39;s ability to regenerate Magicka and making them rely purely on their spell absorption. My character wasn&#39;t into alchemy either, so he had a [i]bit[/i] of a problem staying alive. \r<br />\r<br />At some point I had to use one of the Nordic pillar traps that spew flames in order to fill up my Magicka, and asked myself this: why do I need to rely on these random occurrences? Can&#39;t I just ask my fellow mage colleagues to do the same, but in a controllable manner? \r<br />\r<br />Well, with this mod you can do that. The mod adds a dialogue option to certain NPCs so that they will start casting a modified Flames spell for about 15-20 seconds. You can ask your followers, as well as priests, court wizards, mages in College of Winterhold, or anyone who is your friend (relationship rank &gt;=1, value that can be modified in the MCM). This will start a short animation package with your ally hitting you with said spell. These spells won&#39;t damage anyone else other than you. I have also implemented a Magicka drain effect, since asking NPCs to cast spells via packages doesn&#39;t actually make them use up their Magicka.\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]Ufl1HzrP3C8[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Just in case something bad happens to you, your Ally will stop casting if you interrupt them with dialogue, or start healing yourself. \r<br />\r<br />Another feature is a lesser power which automatically triggers a similar animation, but using Firebolt instead. The power can be used either via a magic menu, or with a key press (set in MCM). This power has a few advantages: first of all, it can be used whilst in battle - it will find a random ally nearby and make them stop whatever they are doing to help you. Secondly, you can also target your certain summoned creatures - Flame and Storm Atronachs, Seekers and Ash Spawns.\r<br />\r<br />The dialogues activate when you are holding a ward, so that you can replenish your Magicka with correct perks. Please note that you won&#39;t get any experience that way. \r<br />\r<br />This mod can easily make your character overpowered, but at the same time I find it much weirder that I couldn&#39;t ask my followers to supply my with Magicka, that [i]one thing[/i] they had the abundance of. \r<br />\r<br />[b]MCM options include:[/b]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][size=2]Configurable magnitude of the fake spells (25% - 175%),[/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]configurable optional hotkey of the Atronach Ally Field command,[/size]\r<br />[*][size=2]Configurable[url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Disposition] relationship rank[/url] with strangers that could be potential allies,[url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Disposition][/url][/size] \r<br />[*][size=2]Debug mode, just in case something goes wrong. [/size]\r<br />[/list] \r<br /> [b][size=4]Troubleshooting[/size][/b]:\r<br />The scenes won&#39;t always play as intended, making your ally stop after saying &#34;of course&#34;. I guess this is a problem with their packages conflicting. In order to prevent any problems: a) whatever action we are attempting will cease itself after 30 seconds, b) if a scene starts playing, it will cease after 15 seconds , c) if a scene started playing, and animation bugged or hasn&#39;t started, you can ask your ally to &#34;Stop that&#33;&#34;, either via dialogue or MCM debug options.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[Heading][size=3]Translations [/size][/Heading]\r<br />The mod has been localised in TesVedit, translated in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29148/?]TesVTranslator[/url]; all of the Strings files are included in the archive. MCM is translatable as well.\r<br />Currently supported languages: [b]English[/b], [b]Polish[/b] and [b]Japanese (1.1 onwards, thanks to BowmoreLover)[/b]. Other languages use English as base.
