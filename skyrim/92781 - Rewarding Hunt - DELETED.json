Wasn't rewarding enough. I've downloaded a few mods that just added too much. So, I decided to create a mod that just raises the prices and decided to share it.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This mod should work with everything that doesn't edit the prices of animal hides, pelts, tusks, and meats.   \n<br />ï»¿Let me know if there are any problems or if you want me to add anything to the mod.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Requirements:[/u][/b]\n<br />- Skyrim[/size]",
