  "summary": "Adds Captain America as a follower outside Riverwood with a spare set of armor.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds a unique follower to Skyrim, based on the Marvel character, Steve Rogers, Captain America, The Super Soldier, The First Avenger&#33; \r<br />\r<br />This is for Male Only. \r<br />\r<br />You&#39;ll find him outside Riverwood. He will level with the player and is a 1 handed warrior but should just use his shield and has his own perks. \r<br />\r<br />Furthermore, it adds an second set of armor. \r<br />\r<br />*************************************************** \r<br />The Armour: \r<br />Based around the Blades armour retextured with the red, white and blue scheme of Captain America. It&#39;s unenchanted, and can only be crafted under the Iron section of the Sky Forge, and tempered as usual at the workbench. Stat-wise it&#39;s a little stronger than Blades. \r<br />Note the set is standalone, and not a replacer of the Blades armour. Although it&#39;s based on the iconic Captain America suit of Marvel, i&#39;ve attempted to make it look more armor based, more in keeping with Skyrim. It&#39;s about as lore-friendly as you can get. \r<br />\r<br />The Weapon - Shield:\r<br />Based on the Dawnguard Shiel retextured with the red, white and blue scheme of Captain America&#39;s Shield. It&#39;s unenchanted, and can only be crafted under the iron section of the Sky Forge, and tempered as usual at the smithing table. Stat-wise it&#39;s a little stronger than the Dawnguard Shield.\r<br />Note is is standalone, and not a replacer of Dawnguard Shield. Although it&#39;s based Captain america&#39;s Shield of Marvel, i&#39;ve attempted to make it look more like a weapon from Skyrim. It&#39;s about as lore-friendly as you can get.  \r<br />\r<br />************************************************** \r<br />Compatibility & Troubleshooting \r<br />This mod reqiures Dawnguard DLC&#39;s. \r<br />\r<br />The armour should not conflict with anything else. \r<br />**************************************************\r<br />\r<br />Installation: \r<br />Simply extract the archive into the Skyrim folder, so the .esp, textures folder, and meshes folder all land into your skyrim/data directory. \r<br />Typically: \r<br />C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim \r<br />\r<br />C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim",
