  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#fff2cc]I have created Ganondorf The Dark Lord of Evil in Skyrim from the Legend of Zelda gaming series. \r<br />[img]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb458/Simdrew1993/Ganondorf%20Skyrim/enb2014_10_1802_03_29_60_zps86b68da4.png[/img]\r<br />[img]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb458/Simdrew1993/Ganondorf%20Skyrim/AllHailLordGanonSkyrim_zps149d69aa.png[/img]\r<br />[img]http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb458/Simdrew1993/Ganondorf%20Skyrim/enb2014_10_1802_27_42_01_zpsa7530605.png[/img]\r<br />Prologue:\r<br />\r<br />After a drop of the hero&#39;s blood was spilt the evil king&#39;s[/color] [color=#fff2cc]servants had taken the sample to an altar to perform a ritual in which the demon king would be brought back to life once again. Soon after.... Ganondorf was resurrected, as he emerged from nowhere he started slowly by observing his surroundings making an evil smirk relieved to know that he was back once again, he then knew exactly what he wanted, revenge on Link and Princess Zelda&#33; He devised a plan, he started studying spell tomes on summoning those he wished to summon in his presence, he wished to claim the power of the Triforce once and for all&#33; If all went according to plan Link and Zelda would be spawned where he would defeat them then claim the Golden Relics thus forming the Triforce..... then long after reading his tomes he gathered new-found knowledge about portals, he cast the spell but all went wrong, instead of summoning Link and Zelda, it backfired.... a dark vortex opened up out of nowhere Just then Ganondorf was sucked into the portal reappearing in the land of Skyrim, as he stands where he is he see&#39;s children and woman crying as Stormcloaks and Imperial&#39;s are killing one an other in the civil war...He seems quite pleased with what he sees. [/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#fff2cc]Link and Zelda were also sucked into different portals of dark energy that appeared around them. After the portals absorbed the chosen ones they were sealed, perhaps there would be no return...All 3 had awoken in Skyrim. What adventures lie ahead? That&#39;s up to you.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/color]---------------------------------------------------------------[color=#fce5cd][size=3]-END[/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#cc0000][size=4]\r<br />As Ganondorf will you embrace your path of power by slaying all that oppose you and by burning all to the ground? Or will you do good deeds to manipulate those into thinking highly of you only to gain enough trust to commit kills after they all least expect it or corrupt those around you.
