  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][b][color=yellow]What the heck is this mod?[/color][/b][/size]\r<br />Adds a female Redguard 1-handed heavy armored follower, with a nice collection of customized offensive holy magic to bring her wrath down upon the undead - a true Palidin - all will fall by her hand\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Background:[/b][/size]Sipping a Cliff Racer to privately celebrate a dragon victory (you got away alive and it didn&#39;t chase you to the end of the map), you glance up and spot a face of experience. By the scars on her body you guess ancient nord weapons.  Perhaps an undead specialist?  You strike up a conversation. ...no stranger to dragon battles, her fortunes have settled on ancient ruins.  You each have many stories..the hours melt away with the help of Talen-Jei&#39;s concoctions.  Today you drink together...... to be continued\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]Overview:[/color][/b]  She&#39;s a Redguard heavy armored fighter, restorationist, and alterationist that is set to be defensive, primarily relying on one-handed with shield.  She also has offensive restoration magic designed specifically for her. This makes her entirely  effective against undead.  Once her alteration hits the right level, she will use paralyze.   I&#39;d sum up her combat strategy as defensive/circle/power attack.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]Location:[/color][/b]  Riverwood - usually hanging about on the island with the mill\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][color=yellow]Here is what you get and notes on the tweeks:[/color][/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]Customized Race:[/color][/b] slightly modified Redguard - only tweek is +100 to burden, and Health/Stamina/Magicka start at 100, same as the PC\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]Customized Class:[/color][/b]  as she levels up she favors health and stamina two to one over magicka.  She will increase the following skills - One-Handed, Archery, Block, Heavy Armor, Sneak, Alteration and Restoration\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]Customized combat style:[/color][/b] I&#39;d describe it as defensive/circle/power attack.  As for weapons, she favors bows, staffs, one handed and shields.  I highly suggest giving them all to her. Her AI is tweeked to entirely prioritize weapon selection from longest range to shortest range - in that order.  This enables you to somewhat manipulate what weapon she attacks with by carefully planning the range to commence your attack.  In some situations, using a bow will increase survivability, in others melee may be called for.  She is very flexible.  She is trained in shield attacks and power attacks and is tweeked to look for oppurtunistic moments and capitalize on them using shield bashes and power attacks. She is not set to use dual wield on purpose.  She is really that good with her shield.  The shield also increases her survival rate.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]Customized build:[/color][/b]\r<br />- levels with the player to infinity\r<br />- Essential/Protected: no\r<br />- Marriage possible\r<br />- Confidence: Average (from my experience in Requiem, if she runs away you should also)\r<br />- Morality: No crime\r<br />- Health/Stamina/Magicka Offsets:  none, she is as fragile as the PC, an equal\r<br />- Starting gear: Her inventory will contain everything she needs to initially get started.  It includes no overpowered special weapons or equipment. Most of it is randomly selected from the leveled lists for the level you initially find her.  Requiem unlevels some lists so this can have an interesting result.  I&#39;d describe the net result as &#39;just right&#39;.\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]Spells:[/color][/b]\r<br />Offensive:  Customized Restoration spells from the Turn Undead category through Master, Paralyze\r<br />Defensive: Defensive spells from Alteration, Mage Light, Self Healing spells\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]Perks:[/color][/b]\r<br />Complete perk set for Restoration, Heavy Armor, Block, One-handed, and Sneak (no trap triggering)\r<br />Partial perk set to support her spells and role for Archery and Alteration\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][color=yellow]Requirements:[/color][/b][/size]\r<br />None, this is stand alone\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]Installation:[/color][/b]\r<br />Drop the file contents into the Skyrim/Data directory or use your favorite mod manager\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=yellow]My Other Mods[/color][/b]\r<br />[b][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28922]Elirya - Altmer Witch Stand-Alone Follower[/url][/b]\r<br />[b][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29800]Calerial - Bosmer Ranger Stand-Alone Follower[/url][/b]\r<br />[b][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30175]Eryniel Elf Standalone Follower w Spriggan Magic[/url][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][color=yellow]Credits:[/color][/b][/size]\r<br />Amazing skin texture: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24394]Body Imperfect by betterbecause[/url] \r<br />Wonderful eyes: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28457]Magistrate Eyes[/url] \r<br />Piercings: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13469]Piercing by newermind43[/url] \r<br />Awesome toes: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3666/11064]Phygit&#39;s FemFeet[/url] \r<br />Skeletons for the masses: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11064]Ning&#39;s 3-2-1 Skeleton[/url] \r<br />Tktk and RAN46 for the mean looks: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12951]Enhanced Character Edit[/url] \r<br />Sensible build out approach: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3331560]Natilde&#39;s turorials and followers[/url] \r<br />Best mod on the Nexus: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19281]Requiem by Xarrian[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b][color=yellow]Armor in some of the pics:[/color][/b][/size]\r<br /> [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11951]You Call That Skimpy - UNP[/url] ",
