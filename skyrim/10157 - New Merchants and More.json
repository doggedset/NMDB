You can kill the Breezehome dog if you don\\'t want him. \r\n\r\nRemember the Mudcrab from Morrowind with 10k gold?  This mod adds a merchant with 10,000 gold upstairs in the Bannered Mare in Whiterun. He will buy anything, including stolen goods, but he won\\'t buy quest items.\r\n\r\nAnother merchant can be found in Radiant Raiment in Solitude. She sells clothing items such as Jarl\\'s clothes, Jester clothes, Wedding dress, General Tullius\\' armor, Ulfric\\'s clothes & more.  \r\n\r\nThe last merchant is located in Falkreath Jarl\\'s Longhouse or anywhere Jarl Siddgeir is. She has 5,000 gold and will sell you spell books and scrolls.\r\n\r\nAll of these merchants are dogs.\r\n",
