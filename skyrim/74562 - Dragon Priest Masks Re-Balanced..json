  "descriptionHtml": "Remember when Dragon Priests were considered as tough secret bosses and been said to have ancient, powerful masks? Only to be disappointed when a good majority of them are practically useless? I remember that feeling. I hate that. So I took it upon myself to rebalance the Dragon Priest Masks to make them actually good. I also changed some of the enchantments to better fit the theme of the Dragon Priests. For example, Hevnoraak, where it means &#34;Brutal&#34; in human tongue, only gives 100% resistances to poison and disease. Yeah nah. So here are the changes I&#39;ve made. If you see any bugs or have any suggestions, please feel free to let me know&#33; \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=5]==HEVNORAAK &#34;BRUTAL&#34;==\r<br />[/size][s]\r<br />100% to Poison and Disease[/s]\r<br />+20 to Heavy Armor\r<br />+20 to Block\r<br />+50 to Health\r<br />\r<br />Context: 100% resistance to disease and poison is practically useless 99% of the time. There was no reason to think this mask was &#34;brutal&#34; as the name suggests. I&#39;ve debated whether or not if I wanted it to give offensive combat enchantments or defensive. I chose defensive because it was less restrictive and I personally thought being a tank being brutal. [/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=5]==KROSIS &#34;SORROW&#34;==\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=3][size=2]+20 points to Archery, Alchemy, [s]and Lockpicking[/s]\r<br />[/size][/size]+20 points to Light Armor\r<br />\r<br />Context: This was one of the harder masks to balance for it&#39;s theme. I never understood why lockpicking was part of the mask. I added Light Armor to better fit it&#39;s current enchantments.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]==VOLSUNG &#34;HORROR&#34;==\r<br />\r<br />[/size]+20 points to Speech, [s]Carry Weight[/s], [s]and Waterbreathing[/s]\r<br />+20 points to Illusion, and +20 points to Conjuration\r<br />\r<br />Context: Why does the &#34;horror&#34; mask affect carry weight? This just looks like random enchantments thrown together. I took out Waterbreathing for Conjuration and took out Carry Weight and replaced it with Illusion. Fits the theme of &#34;horror&#34; I thought.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]==MOROKEI &#34;GLORIOUS&#34;==[/size]\r<br />\r<br />+100% Magicka Regen\r<br />-20% cool down to shouts\r<br />+20 points to Alteration\r<br />(gives 0 armor to fully benefit from mage armor)\r<br />\r<br />Context: Morokei was okay at best. Oddly enough that when going to Creation Kit, there was a Morokei enchantment that wasnt being used and it just decreased the shout cooldown. Which is somewhat odd. So I added the Magicka Regen and better alteration. This mask is intended for pure mages so I made it to help pure mages even more so. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]==RAHGOT &#34;ANGER&#34;==\r<br />[/size]\r<br />+50 points to Stamina \r<br />+30% to Health Regen\r<br />+30% to Stamina Regen\r<br />\r<br />Context: Originally, this mask only gave +70 to stamina and thats it. Why would I use this mask when I can enchant a helmet that not only gives better armor but with the same effect? So I thought to nerf the stamina a bit but added in regeneration to both stamina and health to help with the &#34;anger&#34; theme. Some might say rage is undying.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]==VOLKUN &#34;SHADOW&#34;==\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[s]+20 points to Alteration, Illusion, and Conjuration.[/s]\r<br />+20 points to Sneak, Pickpocket, and Lockpicking\r<br />Your movement is muffled.\r<br />\r<br />Context: Thief and Assassin&#39;s best friend is the shadow. I was thinking about adding +20 to Illusion but thought it would better fit to the Horror mask. Also added muffled and thought it would be a great addition.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]==KONAHRIK &#34;WARLORD&#34;==\r<br />\r<br />[/size]Konahrik&#39;s Privilege \r<br />+30 to Health, Stamina, and Magicka\r<br />\r<br />Context: The last mask to obtain after you have all of the other masks in Skyrim. While the mask is good on itself, I thought to give it a little buff to make it even better so that way you&#39;re not 100% relying on a random chance to proc it&#39;s active. Become the Warlord of the Dragon Priests. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]== WOODEN DRAGON PRIEST MASK &#34;INITIATE&#34;==\r<br />\r<br />[size=2]Learn all skills 10% Faster\r<br />\r<br />Context: I wanted to make the Wooden Mask a little more special. Everything else is the same. I implemented the learning 10% faster because I had an idea of a risk/reward kind of mask. Where a mask that makes you run the risk of having practically no armor and no combat stats but having the reward of leveling up faster. [/size][/size][/center]",
