  "descriptionHtml": ":: Screenshots incoming::\r\n\r\n::Vanilla weathers incoming::\r\nThis might take a while as there are way more image spaces to edit than CoT\r\n\r\n::Lanterns of Skyrim Preset incoming::\r\nI've already done this somewhat, I just need to check it properly.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is a custom night level plugin to make the nights darker when using Climates of Tamriel.\r\n\r\nNights have been made much darker without the sunglasses effect seen in the presets that come with CoT. However, it doesn't give all weathers the same darkness.\r\nThe darkness will change depending on what weather is currently occurring, the brightest being weather during an aurora and the darkest being rainy weather.\r\nI made it this way to try and emulate the light emitted by the moons/stars and auroras. The differences are subtle but still noticeable. For instance you can see the ground (slightly) during clear weather nights and during an aurora you can see slightly more. During overcast weather you might be able to see a few things in front of you, but during rainy weather you will see virtually nothing.\r\nThe brightness of fog weathers comes about in between overcast and rainy weathers.\r\n\r\nBecause the nights have been made so dark, it can be easy to get lost (hence the name \"Lost in the Dark\") so you will need either a torch or the candlelight spell in order see where you are going (might not be so necessary during clear/aurora weathers). However, even with a torch, you can still get lost as it wont light up much, only things very close to you. You'll have to think about your journey, prepare and perhaps wait for some clearer weather before you leave, otherwise you may just find yourself... Lost in the Dark O_O.\r\n\r\nNote: The vanilla torches may be insufficient. So I have included a plugin to make the torches brighter.\r\nSee \"Guided by Fire\" under the downloads section.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n::Installation::\r\nFor \"Lost in the Dark -  CoT\"\r\nREQUIRES - [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17802/?]Climates of Tamriel[/url] by jjc71\r\nJust download and install.\r\nIn your load order, place it where you would normally put your CoT night level plugin.\r\n\r\nFor \"Guided by Fire\"\r\nDownload and install.\r\nPlace it after anything that edits the torches, that includes ELFX. I think I edited mine based on ELFX anyway. I will upload some other variants later. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n::Issues::\r\nWhile I have tested this on MY computer with MY screen, I can't guarantee it will be the exactly the same on yours. So to give you some perspective, I am using an Asus VE247 Monitor set on the \"Scenery\" \"Splendid\" profile.\r\nHow this may translate onto other monitors, I have no Idea :/\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n::My other Uploads::\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37169/?]Glass Helmet Fix[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38712/?]Xvision Children - Redone[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/36428/?]Bugs CoT and RLO or ELFX SweetFX Preset[/url]\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n::Credits::\r\njjc71 for: Climates of Tamriel\r\nBethesda for: Skyrim",
