  "summary": "The tower which once belonged to the lost God of Magic is now up for grabs.",
  "descriptionHtml": "As the \\\"dead\\\" God of Magic, Alnitak searches for his power to return to godhood, he has left his tower on his quest to retrieve his power locked away in a staff. In his time gone, his tower is completely unsecured for anyone who might want it. The tower\\'s official lore is separate from TES lore, but I tried to tie them both together in the intro book. It\\'s my first mod so please report any bugs, suggestions, or problems. Yes I know about the kitchen floor and I\\'m working on it.\r\n\r\nThere is a problem with lighting in the orrery and library which I\\'m currently trying to figure out. For now let\\'s just assume they\\'re constantly lit up because of all the energy flowing through those rooms. You\\'ll see what I mean. Basically it\\'s a remake of Magicka Tower which can be found here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9181\r\n\r\nPlease add your own photos, or endorse it if you like it. \r\n\r\nPlease don\\'t add this tower to any other website, however feel free to make any translations of it for the nexus\r\n\r\nIncompatibilites\r\nNone so far. If you see any, be sure to let me know.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s located just south of Aftland with a dwemer marking.",
