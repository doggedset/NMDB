  "summary": "Just a little mod that gives a bonus to the Arch Mage Robes (both hooded and not). It raises the cost reduction from 15% to 25%. This was done just in case you still want to enchant 3 other items with 25% to a specific school to get the free casting (100% reduction) for that school, but still wear the archmage robes. It also bumps the Magicka Regen",

It also bumps the Magicka Regen from 100% to 125%, the Expert robes all have 125% you\\'d think the Arch Mage would at least be on par.\r\n\r\nAlso fixes the Hoodless Arch Mage Robes by adding the +50 to Magicka that was missing. (Hoodless Arch Mage Rode ID code=0007c932)\r\n\r\nInstallation: Just extract the Rar file directly into your Skyrim/Data folder and make sure it is checked in the \\\"Data\\\" section of the Skyrim launcher (though it checks it by default when it detects a new file).\r\n\r\nPS. Old version left for download in case you want to leave the Magicka Regen unchanged.",
