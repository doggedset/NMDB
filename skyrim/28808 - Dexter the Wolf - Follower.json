  "summary": "Dexter the wolf is a white wolf who was captured and locked up in the Dragons Reach Dungeon.  You rescue him and he becomes your life long companion.",
  "descriptionHtml": "He\\'s an essential animal companion so you can still have a humanoid companion.  He is located in the Dragonsreach dungeon in one of the jail cells. There is a bug where when you first talk to him, you will only be able to tell him to wait or leave, you have to tell him to wait, then talk to him again to tell him to follow.  There is a second bug, it seems that when you crouch he leaves your service and I\\'m not sure why.  If anyone can think of a fix for these bugs please let me know.This is my first mod so I\\'m still not an expert on fixing minor things like this.\r\nThis install is simple, just drag WolfFollower.esp into your .../Skyrim/Data folder and launch the game.  \r\nFeel free to report any bugs",
