  "descriptionHtml": "During my gameplay i was always wondering, why can\\'t I get a weapon that look really cool (i.e. like Mehrunes Razor) but without those stupid enchantments? In most cases custom created weapons can be much more powerfull than even deadric artifats, but still i was tight to standard look of a weapon. Skyrim is full of crazy and good-looking models, but mostly we can get those items in form of some kind \\\"crap\\\" items, especially compared to custom created weapons and armors.\r\nThat\\'s why i created this mod.\r\n\r\nThis mod modify Arcane Blacksmith Perk by adding ability to create usable replicas of almost all artifact and unique items that exists in the game.\r\nThe key is, you can only craft those items while having original ones in your inventory (you know, quick look and craft, another quick look to apply some corrections :) ). You don\\'t need to finish specific quests for them, you can craft replica until you have original in your bag (i.e. The Rueful Axe before turning in quest).\r\nSmall exception is for leveled items: no matter which version you have, replica will be always correspondent to its strongest version.\r\n\r\nAll created Replicas can be tempered, and used as a normal weapon and armors with stats of original item, but without their magical powers (i.e. dagger that looks like Mehrunes Razor - presonally i like it more that standard daedric dagger). As long as you need Arcane Duplicator Perk to craft all replicas, you still need apropriate perk to improve items (i.e. Chillrend is still a glass sword, so you need Glass Smithing to take full benefits from tempering it).\r\n\r\n---------- UPDATE 2 ----------\r\nI\\'ve changed this mod a bit, by addint Arcane Duplicator functionality straight to Arcane Blacksmith Perk (now it should be compatibile, with all smithing addons, which modifys this perk too i.e. by adding something new to its mechanizm).\r\n\r\nAdded clothes:\r\n- Thalmor Robes\r\n- Thalmor Hooded Robes\r\n- Jester\\'s Armor - will work with either Jester\\'s Clothes set or Cicero\\'s Clothes set (if you decide to kill Cicero :P )\r\n\r\nPS. In total addidtion i\\'ve modified Shrouded Gloves and Ancient Shrouded Gloves so now they can be disenchanted :)\r\n\r\n---------- UPDATE ----------\r\nAdded armors:\r\n\r\n- Thieves Guild Armor - should work with normal and improved version\r\n- Guild Master\\'s Armor\r\n- Shrouded Armor - should work with normal, worn and ancient version - crafted items are the same as Ancient Shrouded Armor\r\n- Nightingale Armor - crafted item are the same as highest version of this set, should work with all leveled versions\r\n- Linwe\\'s Armor\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nItem list depending on material type (and smithing perk needed to take full benefits from tempering):\r\nthere is no staves, since they are unable to enchant, so there is no point of creating any without enchants\r\n\r\nSTEEL\r\nDawnguard Rune Axe, Dawnguard Rune Hammer, Harkon\\'s Sword, Wuuthrad, Hevnoraak, Krosis, Vokun, Dawnguard Rune Shield, Masque of Clavicus Vile, Shield of Ysgramor, Targe of the Blooded, Blade of Woe, Bolar\\'s Oathblade, Dragon Priest Dagger, \r\n\r\nDWARVEN\r\nKeening, Aetherial Crown, Aetherial Shield, Spellbreaker, \r\n\r\nORCISH\r\nVolendrung, Rahgot, The Rueful Axe, \r\n\r\nEBONY\r\nDawnbreaker, Ebony Blade, Mace of Molag Bal, Mehrunes Razor, Nightingale Blade, Nightingale Bow, Nahkriin, Ebony Mail, \r\n\r\nELVEN\r\nAuriel\\'s Bow, Morokei, Auriel\\'s Shield, \r\n\r\nADVANCED (Scaled, Steel Plate)\r\nKonahrik, Volsung, Helm of Yngol,\r\n\r\nGLASS\r\nChillrend, Otar, \r\n\r\nNONE (no tempering available)\r\nArchmage\\'s Robes, Necromancer Amulet, Ring of Hircine, Ring of Namira, Drainheart Sword / Ghostblade, Drainspell Bow, Wooden Mask, Thalmor Robes, Hooded Thalmor Robes, Jester\\'s Clothes\r\n\r\nLEATHER (there is no perk corespondent to leather material type, so these armors won\\'t take full benefit from improving them)\r\nSavior\\'s Hide, Thieves Guild Armor, Guild Master\\'s Armor, Shrouded Armor, Nightingale Armor, Linwe\\'s Armor,\r\n\r\n===== COMPATIBILITY =====\r\nSmithing Perks Overhaul http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6047 tested by Daiyus\r\n\\\"...It\\'s completely compatible as long as <Arcane Duplicator> is loaded AFTER <Smithing Perk Overhaul>...\\\".\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nThat\\'s all for now.\r\nHope you enjoy it.",
