  "descriptionHtml": "This is my tweaked ppi setup that provides darker nights, sharper image and slightly less saturated colours, without the performance hit I was getting from similar mods.\r\nIt\\'s based on the look I was getting from Realistic Skyrim v3, which was my favourite, but also knocked about 8fps off my frames so this is why I tweked this one instead.\r\n\r\nMake sure to set gamma to 1.0000 in skyrimPerfs.ini file or else it will be too dark.\r\n\r\nEnjoy :)\r\n\r\nLet me know how it goes for you.\r\n\r\nTO INSTALL - Place contents of zip file in skyrim root directory.\r\n\r\nTO REMOVE - Delete the folder and 3 files from skyrim root directory.",
