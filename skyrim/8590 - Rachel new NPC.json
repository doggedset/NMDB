  "summary": "A new NPC placed just outside of whiterun, created to look like one of my characters.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Meet Rachel\r\n\r\nShe is a slim nord woman with auburn hair and good looks (imo).\r\nShe is marriageable and could become a follower in later updates.  Though I have not listed her house as hers yet.  Chests respawn and I do not know if she will come live with you when you marry her.\r\nNote, the picture with the amulet of Mara, is my character not the NPC.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe is based on one of my characters which is based on a real life person.\r\nI am not going to tell you who she is based on, just guess it ^^\r\nAt the moment she is marriageable, but I haven\\'t fully tested it(started the dialogue but did not marry (yet)).\r\nHer house is just a copy of breezehome, and has not been given a key or any ownerships yet, and it may be a little messy -.-\r\nShe has a weird skin bug that makes her face look darker, this could be because I have got some re-texture mods installed, please confirm this.\r\nIt is located outside of whiterun somewhere around the stables.\r\nMade after the skyrim 1.4 patch\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n1. Just drop the .esp file in your data folder.\r\n2. Don\\'t forget to check if it is checked.\r\n3. Have fun playing Skyrim.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease(s)\r\n\r\n1.0 : Base release\r\n1.1 : somewhat fixed the dark skin bug, it is still there but less noticeable.  Also fixed the         floating water bug, and cleaned her house a bit.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent functionality:\r\n- marriageable (not fully tested)\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture functionality:\r\n- make her a possible follower\r\n- give her some quests (so you need to do something to marry her)\r\n- feel free to make a request\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may use this mod/NPC in your own mods, but only if you give proper credit.",
