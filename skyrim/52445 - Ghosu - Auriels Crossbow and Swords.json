You should get there on the Dawnguard questlines. Bolts and arrows are craftable at the forge (MISC). \r<br />\r<br />If you want to simply cheat/teleport to the chest, open console (key ^) and enter:\r<br />COC DLC01TEMPLEENTRYCELL\r<br />... and, as example, COC RIVERWOOD or COC WHITERUN to teleport back.\r<br />\r<br />Crossbow and Longsword v1 are requested items so i won&#39;t touch their designs. I added the other versions as &#34;a little bonus&#34;. Sinister/blazing bolts and arrows are simply versions without magic effects.\r<br />\r<br />You might be interested in my Quiver Replacer mod as well: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51822/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51822/?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]PLEASE READ THE FAQ SECTION BEFORE YOU SPAM THE COMMENTS WITH RANDOM STUFF&#33;&#33;&#33;[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://666kb.com/i/cmeqqdagk0e2iv3a1.png[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Q: Why no funny FAQ this time?\r<br />A: Lack of time. And tbh. 99% of my last FAQ fits pretty much all of my mods.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Q: Why DG required?\r<br />A: Because the mod uses DG content.\r<br />\r<br />Q: I want the crossguard of sword X mixed with the crossguard of sword Y, i want the pommel of Sword Z combined with the blade of Sword X...it would look much better&#33;\r<br />A: Sorry, i won&#39;t release 10.000 different versions...i just made them the way i prefer it.\r<br />\r<br />Q: You should change this and that...this part is too big, it&#39;s pointing the wrong direction and...\r<br />A: The only requested items of this mod were the crossbow and longsword v1 - i won&#39;t change them because they are based on the concepts of the users that requested it.\r<br />The other swords and the dagger are just a bonus that i added - don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t download it, or remodel it yourself.\r<br />\r<br />Q: You have to make a quest and story behind these weapons. They deserve it, dropping them in a chest is just lazy&#33;\r<br />A: You&#39;re right. But I really dislike working with the CK, i only love modeling stuff. I won&#39;t do stuff that i don&#39;t want to do.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Then work together with other people so they do that&#33;\r<br />A: I prefer to work on my own as much as possible when it comes to the core of my own mods. I only work with other peoples when it comes to additional stuff like patches or essentiel mechanics i can&#39;t handle myself.\r<br />\r<br />Q: You should make them craftable&#33; Or at least add another version with an optional .esp&#33; And enchanted version...and...\r<br />A: When i drop them in a box people will complain, when i make them craftable other people will complain. I try to keep the count of different .esp files as low as possible -\r<br />It&#39;s a pain in the a** to update a dozen different .esp files if i decide to keep on working on this mod. Enchanted esp, unenchanted esp, craftable esp, chest esp, less dmg esp, more dmg esp...\r<br />\r<br />Q: You should add them to the leveled list&#33;\r<br />A: Nope.\r<br />\r<br />Q: You should add armor&#33;\r<br />A: Nope, creating GOOD armor takes a LOT of time i don&#39;t want to sacrifice - in the same time i can fullfill dozens of other requests and work on other projects.\r<br />\r<br />Q: I&#39;m using mods for Closer Quivers or whatever...\r<br />A: This mod comes with its own (bolt) quiver models, if you want to change its position you can do that within a few seconds yourself.\r<br />Btw, the sheaths are not symmetrical, there is a chain/loop on the inner side to attach it to your armor. If you&#39;re using a weapon position mod that lets you see this site you can rotate the sheath yourself as well.\r<br />\r<br />Q: How?\r<br />A: Download NIFSKOPE (free tool, simply google for it), open the .nif file of the object you want to change (like ...|Skyrim|data|meshes|weapons|Ghosu - Auriel|bolt_sun.nif). In the left window click 0 BSFADENODE, down below in the block details you can change TRANSLATION values (xyz axxis position) and/or ROTATION. Afterwards rightclick on 0 BSFADENODE, TRANSFORM=&gt;APPLY and save/overwrite the file. Done.\r<br />\r<br />Q: Does this mod work with retextures?\r<br />A: Yes, it uses vanilla textures (and paths). \r<br />Crossbow: Body is made of Auriel&#39;s Bow and DG Crossbow as string, swords use Auriel&#39;s Bow (crossguard/hilt) and Auriel&#39;s Shield (pommel and both upper endpieces of the crossguard)\r<br />\r<br />Q: Is this mod Dual Sheath Redux compatible?\r<br />A: Yes, mod directly comes with fitting sheaths.\r<br />\r<br />Q: How about SkyRe?\r<br />A: Atm no direct support. If you&#39;re using Reproccer - all weapons are WeapMaterialElven. If someone want to release an optional .esp with direct SkyRe support - be my guest.\r<br />\r<br />Q: I know you&#39;re not taking any requests atm but...\r<br />A: Nah, please don&#39;t PM me with direct requests or spam the comment section. Most of the time i pick requests from the board, stuff that i like myself as well.\r<br />My PM, mail and Youtube inbox are well filled all the time since i&#39;m helping people out with modding problems/tutorials as well so there is no free time left to accept additional requests.\r<br />\r<br />Please accept that. I&#39;m no mean person, but i&#39;ve already fullfilled &gt;200 requests for sure (not counting the larger mods i&#39;m releasing to the public on The Nexus) ... i&#39;ve never learned to say NO so i&#39;ve already spend too much time on making people happy (that&#39;s why i picked a charity job, i think&#39;s it&#39;s more important to translate this quality to RL). \r<br />\r<br />Yes, the FAQ section is pretty long, but i&#39;m trying to keep the comment section free of requests and the common sh*tstorm. The requested mod would be just the crossbow and one sword without any effects/scripts or whatever, i really want people to understand that anything else is just a nice bonus. I&#39;m picking up requests from the board and doing it the way i want it to be avoiding stuff i don&#39;t like so there won&#39;t be perfection. The original request is already fullfilled to the user&#39;s satisfaction, just sharing it in case someone else likes it this way as well. I will just be around for essential TROUBLESHOOTING, no big updates or additions right now.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Credits[/b]\r<br />Crossbow design by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4991811]U653748[/url]\r<br />Blade mesh/texture by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1232514/]Isilmeriel[/url]\r<br />Script by [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/4308901-ghaunadaur]\r<br />Ghaunadaur[/url]\r<br />Thanks for the inspiration,permission and support.\r<br />\r<br />I hope you enjoy the mod.\r<br />[b]Greetings,\r<br />Ghosu[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Looking for new weapons? \r<br />Check out my Weapon Pack featuring 18 weapons in 32 variations and a shield.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://666kb.com/i/c9xcxywq4r7bwn4gi.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />LINK: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28545//?]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28545//?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Looking for new helmets, a Bone Shield or new staffs?[/b]\r<br />Check out my Helmet Mod featuring over a dozen new helmets and more:\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://666kb.com/i/cjcfllho4k90tm6vk.png[/img]\r<br />LINK: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/43293]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/43293[/url]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />... and my other mod featuring muskets, blunderbuss and even a grenade launcher:\r<br />[img]http://666kb.com/i/c8u1v8s2in5lxaypd.png[/img]\r<br />LINK: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26653/?]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26653/?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://f.666kb.com/i/cjvhn9jp37nlb1hl1.png[/img]\r<br />LINK: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48557/]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48557/[/url]\r<br />\r<br />",
