After the Oblivion crisis had ended, and with it the 3rd Era, blacksmiths found new and more cost-effective ways of creating steel daggers. And so, the iconic Cyrodilic Steel Dagger, was no longer to be found at regular blacksmiths forges. The dagger itself did not entirely disappear though, rather, it became somewhat of a higher standard weapon, commonly carried by high-ranking individuals. And that\\'s how it appeared in Skyrim. Eorlund Graymane has recently come by a recipe for this iconic dagger, and it is now yours to craft!\r\n \r\n[heading][size=5][font=georgia,serif]Details:[/font][/size][/heading]\r\nThe Cyrodilic Steel Dagger\r\nThis is somewhat of a small release from me. The dagger itself is something that kept me occupied while I wasn\\'t doing school-work or hanging out with my friends. Like the rest of my releases, the dagger is very high quality with 2048x2048 textures and a low-mid poly model. I tried making this somewhat dirtier and grittier than my past weapons, so that it was easier to implement into lore. But, if you feel like it looks to extreme for Skyrim, try to imagine that TES:IV was running on CryEnginge 3 :wink:\r\n \r\nThe Dagger can only be crafted at the skyforge, under the steel-section. It is slightly weaker than the daedric dagger.\r\nSo what are you waiting for? Get in game!\r\n \r\n[heading][size=5][font=georgia,serif]Installation:[/font][/size][/heading]\r\nTo find out how to install or uninstall \\\"Cyrodilic Steel Dagger\\\", a simple google search for mod installation will do the trick.
