DESCRIPTION\r<br />===============\r<br />This mod adds an X-wing starfighter from Star Wars Series. Fly anywhere in Skyrim at a blazing speed&#33;&#33; \r<br />\r<br />1. Where to find it\r<br />===================== \r<br />Go to the top of Western watchtower. \r<br />\r<br />2. How to use it\r<br />=====================\r<br />A. Piloting\r<br />Press &#34;E&#34; to ignite the engine. \r<br />Press &#34;Space bar&#34; to exit.\r<br />Press &#34;Left Alt&#34; (Sprint button) to go forward and press again to stop.\r<br />Press &#34;W&#34; to go up.\r<br />Press &#34;S&#34; to go down.\r<br />Press &#34;A&#34; to turn left.\r<br />Press &#34;D&#34; to turn right.\r<br />Press &#34;R&#34; while flying to rotate sideways\r<br />\r<br /> When activated, X-wing will automatically increase its altitude and will start hovering up and down automatically until you press the &#34;sprint button. (left alt).&#34;\r<br />\r<br />B. Firing\r<br />Press &#34;Left mouse button&#34; to fire missiles.\r<br />Press &#34;Right mouse button&#34; to change your ammunition.\r<br />There are 5 types of ammunition: Mixed, Dwemer, Laser, Frost, Shock. You can cycle them by pressing the right mouse button. \r<br />When fighting a dragon in the air, missiles will lock on and seek it out if it is sort-of in front of you when you fire them.\r<br />If you have an NPC companion they will take the rear seat on the flyer and take occasional shots at any dragon that is behind the flyer.\r<br />\r<br />C. Maintenance\r<br />If the X-wing takes damage in combat it will catch fire. Enough damage and it will break apart in the air. You&#39;ll probably die unless you land in water.\r<br />To repair damage, equip the &#39;X wing Repair Hammer&#39; (it&#39;s a weapon) and repeatedly hit the X-wing with it. You can find the repair hammer in a container on the top of Western watchtower.\r<br />\r<br />D. Things to remember\r<br />If you lose X-wing, land it in deep water, let it fall off a mountain etc., one of the fast-travel carriage drivers will recover it for you at a cost of 50 gold. \r<br />There is little protection against breaking quests by going where you shouldn&#39;t. If you&#39;re using Open Cities, enter cities by the gate to be sure of triggering any quests. \r<br />The X-wing won&#39;t go higher than High Hrothgar to avoid breaking the main quest at one point.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />===============\r<br />2. Requirements\r<br />===============\r<br />It requires Skyrim Script Extender 1.6.13 or higher, available from http://skse.silverlock.org, and Skyrim 1.9.32 or higher.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />========================\r<br />3. INSTALLING THE PLUGIN\r<br />========================\r<br />Unzip the file into the /data folder where Skyrim is installed.\r<br />When prompted to overwrite, click yes to all.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />=====================\r<br />4. PLAYING THE PLUGIN\r<br />=====================\r<br />From the Skyrim Launcher, select Data Files and check the box next to the\r<br />name of X wing Fighter.esp. \r<br />Make sure you start Skyrim using SKSE launcher.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />==========================\r<br />5. UNINSTALLING THE PLUGIN\r<br />==========================\r<br />From the Skyrim Launcher, select Data Files and UNcheck the box next to the\r<br />name of X wing Fighter.esp\r<br />For a clean uninstallation, find the Skyrim directory and\r<br />Delete the following:\r<br />1. Data&#92;Meshes&#92;dwemerflyer (&lt;-folder)\r<br />2. Data&#92;Textures&#92;electionis&#92;xwing (&lt;-folder)\r<br />3. Data&#92;Sound&#92;fx&#92;dwemerflyer (&lt;-folder)\r<br />4. Data&#92;X wing Fighter.esp (&lt;-file)\r<br />5. Delete everything that starts with dfm in &#34;scripts&#34; folder under Data and check under &#34;Source&#34; folder as well.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />============================\r<br />6. SAVE GAMES\r<br />============================\r<br />This is a heavily scripted mod, therefore, it can corrupt your save games like other script oriented mods.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />============================\r<br />7. CONFLICTS / KNOWN ERRORS\r<br />============================\r<br />A. This mod is incompatible with Dwemer Flying Machine by AndyW1384\r<br />B. There are minor incompatibilities with Ultimate Followers Overhaul; Companions who&#39;ve been told to &#39;Relax a while&#39; will still be brought on the flyer, unless they&#39;re in an interior or are far away.\r<br />C. When high in altitude, every once in a while, X-wing can turn transparent. Sorry, no fix yet. \r<br />D. When speeding, you might experience CTDs. This is due to the limitations of your GPU and CPU power. Those who have a powerful rig shouldn&#39;t have any problems with speeding.\r<br />Please be aware that this mod is still a work in progress, and contains both known and unknown problems. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />==========\r<br />8. CREDITS \r<br />==========\r<br />A. Bethesda and Star Wars for the game and concepts.\r<br />B. This mod is inspired by the modders resource - Dwemer Flying Machine by AndyW1384  \r<br />C. Magicka Sabers by Lord Haun for the laser mesh and texture.\r<br />\r<br />Please endorse if you like this mod.   \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />==========================\r<br />9. LEGAL STUFF/ DISCLAIMER\r<br />==========================\r<br />Feel free to modify, incorporate into your mod, publish it anywhere on the web as you wish. No need to ask for my permission in any way.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />=================\r<br />10. ANYTHING ELSE\r<br />=================\r<br />I plan to add an animation for X-wing (S-foils) in the future, but not guaranteed. I&#39;ve been working on it, but to no avail. Only succeeded in nif format but not in the game. very frustrating...Any help? ^^ It will be greatly appreciated.\r<br />May the force be with you and enjoy&#33; ",
