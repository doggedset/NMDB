  "descriptionHtml": "If the settings seem to dark for you and you are using realistic lighting try different realistic mods before ruling out this mod ^^.\r\n\r\nEVERYONE ^^ I FINALLY ACCEPTED THIS MOD COULD REALLY ACTUALLY BE USED FOR PHOTOGRAPHICAL PURPOSES AND FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT DEPTH OF FIELD (DOF) ACTIVATED I UPLOADED THE MOD WITH THE DOF SETTINGS TURNED OFF. THANK YOU, ENJOY ^^\r\n\r\n\r\n*NOTE* \r\nI HAVE TESTED THIS ENB SETTING WITH \\\"Realistic Lighting With Customization by Pluto\\\" AND IT WORKS GREAT. FOR THOSE WHO LIKE DARK SETTINGS DOWNLOAD PLUTO\\'S MOD AND USE WITH THIS MOD. YOU CAN FIND THIS MOD AT THIS LINK:\r\n==> http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7654 <==\r\n(HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IF YOU WISH TO SEE THE SAME RESULTS AS SCREENSHOTS)\r\n\r\nAlso if you are experiencing extreme darkness at night or extreme brightness in the day try disable Realistic Lighting Patcher in you data files or nexus manager, this helped for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nI HAVE NOT TESTED WITH EVERY REALISTIC LIGHTING MOD OUT THERE, MAY LOOK EXTREMELY CRAPPY, I DON\\'T KNOW ^^!\r\n\r\n\r\n!!!ATTENTION!!!\r\nIF YOU HAVE TROUBLE WITH THIS MOD NOT WORKING, MAKE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD THE LATEST DIRECTX SOFTWARE, THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON ISSUE WITH MANY WHO TRY TO USE ENB WITH ANY CUSTOM SHADER. ALSO I\\'VE NOTICED EVERYTIME STEAM UPDATES THE CUSTOM SHADER PORTION OF THE MOD DOES NOT WORK SO EVERYTIME STEAM UPDATES DOWNLOAD AND REINSTALL DIRECTX. YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE LATEST DIRECTX SOFTWARE FROM THIS SITE:\r\n\r\n==> http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=35 <==\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRO\r\nIntrigued by Matso\\'s and PMind\\'s Depth Of Field work, I have implemented the DOF files into my iLuv ENB settings. It\\'s my personal taste of how Skyrim should look and feel, the difference between this mod and iLuv ENB is that this mods enbseries.ini was tweaked to be balanced with the Depth Of Field option. Also the PAUSE BREAK feature is now available with this mod. Anywho sharing my graphical tastes with the world is fun and exciting so I really hope this mod suits your tastes as much as it does for me.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\nCopy paste contents of compressed file to ===> \\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim <=== Here ^^!\r\n\r\n\r\nHow To Use\r\nToggle on/off ENB: Shift+F12\r\nToggle on/off Custom Shader: Pause Break\r\n\r\nSETTINGS*\r\n1.) If you just want to Use the ENB Global setting press the PAUSE BREAK key to turn off custom shader (You can tell you did this correctly when textures become more colored and less sharpened)\r\n\r\n2.) If you just want to use the Custom Shader, turn off ENB GLOBAL by pressing SHIFT + F12 keys together. Toggle on/off PAUSE BREAK key for Custom Shader.\r\n\r\nWith these options available you should be able to play four different settings, Vanilla, Vanilla Sharpened, ENB Global or ENB Global + Custom Shader.\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES WITH OVERLY BRIGHT SKY?\r\nOpen enbseries.ini \r\nScroll down to ==> \r\n// Reduce SpecularAmountMultiplierDay/Night to 1.0 if its too shiny for you\r\nDo as it says and reduce the values to 1.0 or 0.8 try both \r\n\r\n[BLOOM]\r\nQuality=1\r\n// Some areas in Markarth especially; really blow out to white, increasing bloom helps \\'fix\\' these blown out parts by mushing them across the screen. At the cost of increasing haziness.\r\nAmountDay=1.5 <== change to 1.0\r\n\r\nIf it\\'s still to bright do this: \r\nScroll down to ==> \r\n[ENVIRONMENT] \r\n// Sunlight during day cast onto scene \r\nDirectLightingIntensityDay=1.2 <== change to 1.0 or 0.8\r\n\r\nEveryone has different issues and setups so its really hard to troubleshoot to fix for everyone so if you can manage try playing with these settings till you get the result that suits you best.\r\n\r\nA COMMON ISSUE\r\nBe sure to copy replace everything it asks you to overwrite when using this mod, don\\'t forget to back up files you dont want to lose ^^! \r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\nCredit goes to Confidence Man, HeliosDoubleSix, joey4track, Tatsudoshi, Hunin, Boris Vorontsov, some_dude, Matsos, PMind and anyone else who helped with the developement of the ENB, Custom Shaders, and DOF projects.\r\n\r\nIf I\\'m missing anyone in the credits just let me know and I will add you asap and also any other mods that appear in screenshots are not mine so give those modders credit not me ^^!
