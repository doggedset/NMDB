  "modName": "Walrus -The Robbaz Inspired Horker Follower -- Gunz77",
  "summary": "An interactive horker companion made to be almost identical to the one used by Robbaz",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is not the mod used by Robbaz, but it is a take from that mod. It adds a kinky horker companion by the Pelaglia farm near the Whiterun Stables. He is a fairly basic follower, but he does INSANE damage, and because he\\'s an animal follower, he can be used with a human(oid) follower as well.  This information is all in the README in the download. Have fun pillaging and yerking off with this GLORIOUS Robbaz-inspired mod!\r\n\r\nSee it (and my other mods) on YouTube!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEE8eqrKnXk\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nUPDATE LOG\r\nv1.0\r\n-- Made Walrus\r\n-- Damage and level set very high\r\n-- health maxed out\r\n\r\n-- made optional base-damage version\r\n\r\n-- added the scripts...\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nBUGS\r\n-- Apparently some people are unable to talk to them. may be an issue with load order or mods they are running. several attempts on my part to recreate the problem have told me that the mod itself does not have any issues.\r\n-- PM me if you have any experience in solving these kinds of \\\"issues\\\" and know how to solve this for the people having this problem.\r\n^^^^^^--Update! found out i was missing the scripts in the uploaded files. Sorry. Please download the mod again, or i will upload an optional \\\"Scripts\\\" RAR if you don\\'t want to reinstall the mod.\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nConflicts\r\n\r\nThis mod should not conflict with any follower mods, as it places a new NPC. Any mods that alter horkers should not cause any conflicts either\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nScreenshots\r\n\r\nPlease take screenshots of Walrus in action. I don\\'t take many, as you would see if you took a look at my previous mods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nFUTURE PLANS\r\n\r\nI don\\'t plan on making any changes myself, but I will make different versions upon request.\r\nI may make more follower mods, and might put them into one \\\"super mod\\\" that incorporates them into one file. At the moment, I\\'m working on a Draugr follower, but it\\'s a bit more complicated when trying to create a more complex npc with no experience. any advice in the comments would be greatly appreciated.",
