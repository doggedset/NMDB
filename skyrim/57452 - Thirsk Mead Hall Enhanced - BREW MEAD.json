  "summary": "Interactive mead kegs and brewers in Thirsk Mead Hall. Brew all types of mead with some new ingredients, and dispense mead from all the kegs there are.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Ever thought Thirsk Mead Hall was a little lackluster? I mean, it&#39;s a mead hall, there&#39;s mead kegs and brewers in it, yet they don&#39;t do anything? Well, with this mod, now they are all interactive&#33; Mead kegs dispense mead, and the brewers can be used to brew any meads you want&#33; A new mead recipe book has been added to the hall so you know the necessary ingredients for brewing each type of mead. There are seven different meads you can make. New ingredients have also been added to the game and can be bought from some vendors.\r<br />\r<br />[u]How is this mod different from other mead brewing mods?[/u]\r<br />Unlike other mods that also allow you to brew your own mead using the cooking pot, my mod stays realistic and lore-friendly by turning the brewers that were originally static objects into usable mead brewers. Open the lid and pour in the ingredients, then dispense the mead from the tap.\r<br />\r<br />REQUIRES DRAGONBORN&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation:[/b] Requires you to have completed the Thirsk Mead Hall main quest and sided with the people of Thirsk, not the rieklings. There also is a version just been uploaded for if you sided with the rieklings, but that contains only the interactive mead kegs, not the brewing of mead. Choose which version you need and install via NMM, or, manually copy the esp to your data folder, and merge the textures, meshes and scripts folders inside your data folder with the ones from this mod :)\r<br />\r<br />[b]Updating: [/b]You must have the main file (NOT the riekling version) installed to use the update. Install the update file after the main file, and when asked if you want to overwrite any files, select &#39;yes&#39;.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Compatibility:[/b] Should be compatible with all other mods, including Realistic Needs and Diseases (although only the water from my mod can be used in brewing).\r<br />\r<br />Credits go to egocarib and matthiaswagg for helping me with the scripting :) Thank you guys very much&#33;",
