  "summary": "Modifies Allure so that it works on merchants of both sexes.",
  "descriptionHtml": "In a game where it is entirely ordinary and accepted that there is same sex marriage and equal opportunity for both sexes, it makes no sense at all that Allure would affect only the opposite sex. While it was likely an oversight, or to make the attribute less powerful, Allure should affect merchants of both sexes. This modifies it so that it does.\r\nAffects all saves.\r\n\r\nMade and tested in version 1.4.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------\r\nUnzip contents of file to Steam/SteamApps/common/skyrim/data\r\nCheck the box next to \\\"AllureWorksOnBothSexes.esp\\\" in the Data Files menu.\r\n\r\nUnnstallation\r\n------\r\nDeactivate in the Data Files menu.\r\nRemove \\\"AllureWorksOnBothSexes.esp\\\" from Steam/SteamApps/common/skyrim/data\r\n\r\nChange Log\r\n------\r\nFebruary 12, 2012: Initial release.",
