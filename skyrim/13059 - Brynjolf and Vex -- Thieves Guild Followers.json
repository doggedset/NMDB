  "descriptionHtml": "[b][size=4]DESCRIPTION[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />This mod allows Brynjolf and Vex to accompany the player as followers after the completion of the Thieves Guild questline.  \r<br />\r<br />Both Brynjolf and Vex have fully voiced responses using their original voice type. \r<br />While following, the player has access to the full follower options: you can have them wait, access their inventory, ask them do something, etc.  \r<br />\r<br />In addition (and by necessity), this mod also fixes the bug with Brynjolf&#39;s dialogue, so he will offer his correct post-quest dialogue instead of the &#34;I&#39;m busy&#34; line.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve modified their stats to make them more valuable as high-level followers with an emphasis on stealth, light armor, and one-handed combat.  \r<br />\r<br />I removed the hood from Brynjolf&#39;s post-quest outfit.  This is just a personal preference.  I found it odd that he suddenly started wearing a hood late in the quest line and preferred the way he looked without it.  \r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />[center][size=5][b]CREDITS[/b][/size]\r<br />[size=3]A huge thank you to [color=orange][b]Faceshifter[/b][/color], who has done an amazing job editing the voice files for this mod. Without his work, many of these dialogue options would not have been possible.[/size][/center]\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]ADDITIONAL INFORMATION[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />The option to have either Vex or Brynjolf follow will occur after the player has officially become the Guild Master.  Get the Guild Master&#39;s armor from Tonila then talk to one of them again.  \r<br />\r<br />The perks I&#39;ve added affect the base actor, so Brynjolf should also be stealthier while he is following the player during the Blindsighted quest.\r<br />\r<br />I removed the hood from Brynjolf&#39;s post-quest outfit.  And created a custom set of Guild Master Armor for both of them.  The standard enchantments don&#39;t really provide any benefit to a follower, so instead the new versions have Muffle, Fortify Light Armor, and Fortify Sneak enchantments.  This is now their default outfit and isn&#39;t accessible to the player.  \r<br />\r<br />The Nightingale Hood Brynjolf is using in several of the photos is from the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5130]Nightingale Maskless[/url] mod by Lord Haun.\r<br />\r<br />[b][i][size=2][color=orange]BETTER STEALTH AI:[/color][/size][/i][/b]\r<br />I have added the script from my [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16531]Better Stealth AI mod[/url] to Brynjolf and Vex.  This means that if you give one of them a torch, they will unequip it when sneaking.  While sneaking, they will wait to initiate combat until either they or the player has actually been attacked.\r<br />\r<br />However, you will still need to have the Better Stealth AI mod installed if you want Brynjolf to have this behavior during the quest Blindsighted.  Make sure that &#34;Brynjolf & Vex Followers&#34; is loaded [b][i]AFTER[/i][/b] &#34;Better Stealth AI.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]FUTURE PLANS[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m currently working on making Brynjolf and Vex marriable and may add Karliah as well.  I&#39;m not using the standard marriage quest but rather creating a entirely new, custom marriage route.  I really want to have something more personal than the &#34;Interested in me, are you?&#34; dialogue. \r<br />\r<br />[url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/662202-brynjolf-vex-karliah-custom-spouses-and-marriage-options/page__pid__5250864#entry5250864]I started a topic to discuss the marriage features.
