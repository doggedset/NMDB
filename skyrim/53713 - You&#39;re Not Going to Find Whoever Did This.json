  "descriptionHtml": "&#34;I&#39;m going to find whoever did this.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />NO YOU AREN&#39;T. This implies that you actually care that the person was murdered, AND that you&#39;re going to track down who did it. The amount of times that this line is actually applicable is hilariously low. I&#39;ve seen people who saw the murderer say it... people that wanted the person dead... people who shouldn&#39;t care at all...\r<br />\r<br />Well, this extremely small mod simply removes that line from the game. They may still say something, as there are other applicable lines, but it won&#39;t be as retarded.\r<br />\r<br />Yours truly,\r<br />The untalented Spitsonpuppies",
