  "descriptionHtml": "NOTE!: Recently found out theres 1 more mod needed which is Enhanced Character edit just install it over pretty faces heres the link :http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12951 \r\nThe save file should now look identical to the picture ones, enjoy.\r\n\r\nRecent Updates:\r\nI made a newer version that is almost identical, but i cant really tell with my new lighting settings but plz try that one if the first one doesnt look as supposed to.\r\n\r\nMay make a better one in the future.\r\n\r\nMOD INSTALLATION(important):\r\nInstall the needed mods exactly as they r listed down below,\r\nPretty Faces has to go before covereyes since covereyes need to replace pretty faces eyes and not vice versa.\r\n\r\nNew Notices:\r\nwhen u load the save it might tell you that u do not have the appropriate mods installed just click to load it anyway and it should be fine.\r\n\r\nFenry by Daltemir \r\nUploaded by daltemir1\r\n\r\nLink to Companion version:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19598\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT\r\nScroll down to see which mod required for the save she wont look the same without them.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nThis mod is a simple save file that includes the character \r\nseen in the screenshots.\r\nThe Character is in the first village right after the intro quest and is equipped\r\nwith most of the gear that is obtainable through the beginning.\r\nThe characters scale is set to 0.9 if you dont like it see good to know.\r\nThe character is a Nord.\r\n\r\nGood to know:\r\n\r\nConsole Commands:\r\n\r\nshowracemenu = brings up the race menu where u can do the changes you like\r\n\r\nplayer.setscale \\\"any number\\\" 1 is default = sets the players overall body scale.\r\n\r\nExtra commands for the I wanna take screenshots persons:\r\n\r\ntfc = toggle free camera (lets you float around the world as spectator)\r\n\r\ntfc 1 = same as tfc but pauses the game (good for when u wanna capture that exact moment)\r\n\r\ntm = toggle menu, hides the User Interface Note that the console will become invisible as well.\r\n\r\nother stuff:\r\nWhen using pretty face it will apply to all female characters in game I think its an improvement\r\nbut you might not think so, so if you are unsure you might not want to use this or you might\r\nwant to find another solution.\r\n\r\nThe save files are saved with minimum mods required to increase chance of full compabillity\r\nhowever it is not tested on a new clean installation of the game and the mods but should work\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nCopy the My Games folder to My documents folder if you dont have the My Games folder\r\nand have your save files somewhere else then just copy the contents you need to that folder\r\n(the .ess files should go to the folder saves).\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory of the mod:\r\nSome years ago when Oblivion used to be popular I used to make small mods such as player\r\nhomes but since then I havent really released anything so I thought\r\nsince im the guy taking hours to customize my characters appearance to what I\r\nprefer why not upload the save file.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\nThe character is made from my personal preference and everyone might not like it.\r\n\r\nWeither you like it or not make sure to look through the mods you liked from the\r\npictures and endorse them if you enjoyed them.\r\n\r\nIf I have forgotten any mod you see in the pictures let me know in the comments \r\nsection.\r\n\r\nI forgot which mod the forward Jump animation is from Think its one in the animation\r\nmod list down below.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE!:\r\nI might not have the time to edit this for some time since I will be gone for the \r\nsummer holiday but I will make sure to answer all unanswered questions when I get \r\nback and make modifications if nesscesary.\r\n\r\nCopyright stuff:\r\nYou may use it in your mods if you leave name of the author (daltemir1) however\r\n you may not change the appearance a little bit (like hairstyle or nose etc)\r\nand reupload as your own.\r\nIf you wanna include the required mods in for this mod in your mod you have to ask the auhors for\r\nPermissions(that is if you would take files of mods and put them all in 1 folder).\r\nHope this all makes sense, ask me if anything seems unclear.\r\n\r\n\r\nMods !NEEDED!
