If you want to contribute, send your feedback and state what you want to change in the next version.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]About this mod[/b]\r\nA complete configuration for ENBSeries and FXAA Post Process Injector aimed at providing good looking game with 747823 and Pluto\\'s [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4323]Realistic Lighting Without Post-Processing[/url].\r\n\r\n[b]Recommended mods[/b]\r\nThis configuration has been tweaked to offer the best results when used with 747823 and Pluto\\'s [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4323]Realistic Lighting Without Post-Processing[/url].\r\nAs such, it is recommended that you use it to enjoy the full effect of this mod.\r\n\r\n[b]Incompatibility[/b]\r\nIt should be compatible with everything. Except other ENB and FXAA configs, obviously...\r\n\r\n[b]Versions[/b]\r\n-0.2a :\r\n+ Colors are more like the regular game\r\n+ More saturation\r\n+ Nicer looking SSAO (It doesn\\'t flicker in the distance anymore.)\r\n+ Darker nights (When combined with Realistic Lightning Without Post Processing. You\\'ll actually have to use a torch ! \r\n-0.1a : Initial release\r\n\r\n[b]Known bugs[/b]\r\n- Hands look way too bright in first person during the night. Third person view looks fine, though, as does everything else. I don\\'t know where this comes from...)\r\n- Water looks good during the night for about 2-3 meters. Then it looks like shit. (Same problem as the hands...) ",
