  "descriptionHtml": "Bathesda did their best to create a great cinematic medieval experience in their dungeons. And they did a gread job. But I am looking for a more realistic dungeon experience. With Darker Dungeons I took the first step. The next step is changing the light sources in these dungeons.\r\n\r\nBut this is a big step, that will take a while to complete. I experimented for some time with the CK and learned one thing or another about lighting. The hardest discovery was the engines limitation to 4 light sources that cast shadows. I hope that another patch will rise this limitation, because shadow casting lights create a way better experience while discovering a dungeon.\r\n\r\nSo, this is taking a while till a finished Version will be online, but I will publish an update for every dungeon that is ready for public. I would realy realy realy like to hear your feedback about these dungeons, because this is a massive project for me and I need encouragement to continue this ;)\r\n\r\n========================================================================================\r\n========================================================================================\r\nBribing time!\r\n\r\nThere are some comments like \\\"houses are too dark\\\" and similar comments. I plan to change the lights in alphabetical order, so places like \\\"Windhelm ...\\\" may come up last on my list.\r\n\r\nBut in celebration of my first \\\"4 star rating\\\" in the steam workshop, I am motivated to change the lights of ONE city (interiors only) on this sunday. So, please comment here what city I should choose. City = big map marker and entered through a gate/leaving the main world.\r\n\r\nVoting ends sunday morning.\r\n========================================================================================\r\n========================================================================================\r\n\r\nChange log:\r\n0.a.1: Added Abandoned Prison: http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Abandoned_Prison\r\n0.a.2: Added Alftand: http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Alftand\r\n0.a.3: Added Angarvunde: http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Angarvunde (Screenshots follow tomorrow)",
