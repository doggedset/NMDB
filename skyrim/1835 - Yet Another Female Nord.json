This is the first character I\\'ve played where I didn\\'t stop at light sources to find the ones that made her look good; I stopped at random light sources to see if I could find one where she looked bad. She really had a knack for looking good in every light source I placed her by. In my opinion, this is my first real great face, and I\\'m not sure I\\'ll ever top it.\r\n\r\n[b][color=#57a2e5]Character Mods Used:[/color]\r\n[color=black]====[/color][/b]\r\nAll of Xenius\\' brilliant character detail mods.\r\nFor those who don\\'t know, Xenius is the author of the detailed character series mods (and \\\"No More Blocky Faces\\\"), and two of them can be found at (currently) the #1 and #2 positions on the Top 100 mods. They\\'re great simply because they don\\'t change the original developer\\'s design at all, but rather display it in much higher fidelity.\r\n\r\n[b][color=#57a2e5]Other Saves:[/color]\r\n[color=black]====[/color][/b]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=629]Another Female Nord[/url]\r\nIn my mind, pretty much just a draft for this mod.\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1683]Another Female Orc[/url]\r\nThe only female Orc I\\'ve created that looks decent to good at all times.",
