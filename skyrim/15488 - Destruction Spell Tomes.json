Because of that, this Skyrim mod of mine has the prefix &#34;Skyrim&#34; at the beginning of the file name. DON&#39;T USE IT FOR OBLIVION&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=\r<br />\r<br />v1.0 - Original release (19th of april, 2012):\r<br />\r<br />Added twelve destruction spell tomes in a chest to the arch-mage&#39;s quarters in the college of Winterhold. The chest is non-respawning so any lost spell tomes will usually be gone forever. You have four lightning spells, four ice spells and four fire spells, all in the wall variant, but they do different amounts of damage. The order from weak to powerful is as follows: Power spells, Judgment spells, Terror spells and Fury spells.\r<br />\r<br />Spell damage (Wall variants):\r<br />\r<br />-Power spells: 25 \r<br />-Judgment spells: 50 \r<br />-Terror spells: 75 \r<br />-Fury spells: 100\r<br />\r<br />*Note that with the release of v1.1 of this mod, the names for these spells are ONLY for the wall variants. Missile and rune variants have different names. The only thing that&#39;s always the same is the damage build-up. Images from the original release have been updated to represent v1.1.*\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />THIS VERSION IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET.\r<br />\r<br />-     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -\r<br />\r<br />v1.1 - Update:\r<br />\r<br />The update v1.1 of this mod is finally here. It includes not only rune spell variants, but also missile variants. The original twelve spells have been renamed, but the spell ID&#39;s have remained the same, so people who had already read those original twelve spellbooks shouldn&#39;t experience any problems at all. After testing, it turned out that the in-game names of the spells were adjusted as well, even if they were activated already. Good news, right?&#33; One last thing before I place the spell stats below, both the original chest and the two new chests are respawning. This means they&#39;re not safe to store your items in.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Spell damage (Missile variants):\r<br />\r<br />-Strike: 25\r<br />-Bolt: 50\r<br />-Blast: 75\r<br />-Surge: 100\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Spell damage (Rune variants):\r<br />\r<br />-Trap: 25\r<br />-Rune: 50\r<br />-Mine: 75\r<br />-Bomb: 100\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />THIS VERSION IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET.\r<br />\r<br />-    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -\r<br />\r<br />v1.2 - Update (6th of July 2016):\r<br />\r<br />-Changed file name to &#34;Destruction Spell Tomes&#34;.\r<br />-The &#34;Bomb&#34; spells have been changed to &#34;Ambush&#34; spells.\r<br />-Nearly all missile variants have been given a new name.\r<br />-The item ID&#39;s of ALL spell tomes and spells have been changed.\r<br />-The ID&#39;s of the storage chests have been changed.\r<br />-In all cases, the damage build-up of the spells has remained the same.\r<br />\r<br />=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=",
