  "descriptionHtml": "!!FEMALE VERSION CAN BE FOUND HERE!!\r\nhttp://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2186\r\n\r\n\r\nHello! This is my first attempt at a retexture and would appreciate comments and constructive criticism!\r\n\r\nI hoped to recreate the Novice Robe so that it represents all schools of magic within the game.\r\nTheir representation on the robe goes as follows;\r\n\r\nDestruction --- Red Symbol\r\nAlteration ----- Green Symbol\r\nRestoration --- Yellow Symbol\r\nIllusion ---------- Blue Symbol\r\nConjuration --- Purple Symbol\r\n\r\nTo represent all of them together on one part of the robe is the symbol at the center flap of the robe, with the corresponding colors as stated above.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these symbols, I placed a new high res fabric texture over the cloth portions of \r\nthe robe.\r\n\r\nNEW ADDITION! ;\r\nWith much thanks to the comments and suggestions, I have released a version with less colorful\r\nsymbols and made them appear more faded and the white edges of the robe have been removed. Special thanks to user Residentmockery for the very helpful comment :)\r\n\r\nI am looking forward to creating a similar retexture for the female version of the novice robe, so keep an eye out. \r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n     -Open using zip file opener\r\n     -Drop/extract the textures folder into your Skyrim data folder [Usually - C:/Program files/ Steam/Steamapps/common/Skyrim/data\r\n     -If you are asked to merge folders click yes. If you do not have a textures folder simply create one.\r\n\r\n\r\n::DISCLAIMER::\r\nSeveral images from several different sources from the internet were used to put this work together; I do not claim to own these images and they are the property of their respectful owners, whomever that may be.
