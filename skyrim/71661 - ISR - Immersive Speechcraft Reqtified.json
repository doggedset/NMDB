  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#ff7700][size=6]ISR - Immersive Speechcraft Reqtified[/size][/color][/center]\r<br />This mod changes a bunch of mechanics of Requiem and Immersive Speechcraft for better balance and more immersive experience.\r<br />\r<br />I missed the olds days when speech used to be a powerful weapon in role-playing games, so I was really happy when I found [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63874/?]Immersive Speechcraft[/url] by SirSalami. However, as a Requiem player I deeply care about game difficulty, and I felt like that mod needed some restrictions for the balance&#39;s sake. With this patch I tried to add Immersive Speechcraft&#39;s mechanics into the world of Requiem, while staying as close as possible to Requiem&#39;s feeling.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4]Requirements:[/size][/color]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281/?]Requiem[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63874/?]Immersive Speechcraft[/url]\r<br />All requirements of mentioned mods.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][size=4]List of changes made by this patch:[/size][/color]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Modified Speech perk tree.\r<br />[*]Added perk requirement for many dialogue options from Immersive Speechcraft.\r<br />[*]Removed restriction of Immersive Speechcraft that allowed player to only use it&#39;s dialogue on NPC&#39;s with vanilla voicesets, instead, dialogue is now limited to playable races.\r<br />[*]Removed Requiem&#39;s disguise perk, as it wasn&#39;t functioning correctly.\r<br />[*]Changed dialogue branches to only show clean text, without added (Fight) etc. \r<br />[/list]\r<br />Load order doesn&#39;t matter, as long as you load ISR after both it&#39;s masters.\r<br />I&#39;m not a native english speaker, so please report any typos/gramatic issues you might encounter.\r<br />Also bugs, report them too.\r<br />[list]\r<br />[/list][color=#ff7700][size=4]Credits:[/size][/color]\r<br />I&#39;d like to thank the following people:\r<br />Xarrian and Ogerboss for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281/?]Requiem - The Roleplaying Overhaul[/url]\r<br />SirSalami for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63874/?]Immersive Speechcraft[/url]",
