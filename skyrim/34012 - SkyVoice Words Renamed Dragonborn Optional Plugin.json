  "descriptionHtml": "I don\\'t like when there\\'s inconsistencies in my user interface >_<\r\n\r\nIn this case it was that the wonderful folks over at SkyVoice had made optional shout rename files for vanilla Skyrim and for Dawnguard, but not for Dragonborn. So I decided to fix that! My very first mod, took me all of about four minutes.\r\n\r\nSkyVoice is available here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28448/\r\nAwesome mod. Check it out.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis does *NOT* require SkyVoice but truthfully I can\\'t imagine why you\\'d want it if you aren\\'t already using their mod and their other optional plugins.",
