  "summary": "Adds dangerous direwolves to Skyrim, and some direwolf followers.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod adds packs of direwolves (bigger, more dangerous wolves) around Skyrim. \r\nThere are two types of direwolves: the normal ones (comes in brown, grey and black) and greater direwolves which are even bigger and stronger.\r\nThere are packs all over Skyrim, but the biggest one is outside Riverwood, just past the campsite thing. \r\nNormal direwolves are level 40 and greater direwolves are 45, so be careful.\r\n\r\nThere is also a direwolf follower just outside of Riverwood, if you cross the bridge and turn left (go off the road) you will find it fighting a bear.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompatibilities: Should work with anything. Comment if you have any problems.\r\n\r\nBugs/glitches:None that I am aware of. Again, comment if you have any problems.\r\n\r\nUpdates: I\\'ve made two more followers, I just need to add them into the world. I will also add more packs.\r\n\r\nInstillation: Download and extract into your Skyrim data folder OR use Nexus Mod Manger\r\n\r\nPermissions: Any one can use or edit this file, but please give credit.\r\n\r\n  ",
