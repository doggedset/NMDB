  "descriptionHtml": "[center][IMG]http://i48.tinypic.com/b8w7l3.png[/IMG][/center]\r\n[b]Current Build:[/b] 0.2, Alpha. Released to the public to test NPCs, locations and followers. Ivarstead Base now fully expanded, any bugs/glitches/problems to be reported asap so I can fix up the house before I move onto the quests. Until Quests are implemented the key to the Upstairs is on the round table by the fire downstairs, the key to the prison isn\\'t in the house as of yet. Follower can be found in Castle Dour, Solitude as he keeps the General informed of events. Build 0.3 will include the first few quests and dialogue as well as (hopefully) new items.\r\n[center][IMG]http://i48.tinypic.com/b8w7l3.png[/IMG][/center]\r\n[b]Description:[/b] Imperial Intelligence? What is it? Who does it? How does the Empire gain its in-depth knowledge, how did Tullius know where and when to strike Ulfric? It\\'s all down to the folks at the White-Thorn cottage outside Ivarstead. These brave Scouts and Rangers of the Empire plan, spy and gather intelligence all across Skyrim. This mod will add an entirely new faction which is housed outside Ivarstead. This faction will have a full questline, voiced dialogue to a high quality, faction unique armour and even roaming NPCs you can meet in the wilds! The mod will be entirely lore-friendly, names and locations and the backstory will slot in perfectly with the already-put-down lore of skyrim and the empire. This mod is so lore-friendly in-fact, that you don\\'t become the leader of the faction within ten quests, you don\\'t become the leader of the Valodiun Rangers at all.\r\n[center][IMG]http://i48.tinypic.com/b8w7l3.png[/IMG][/center]\r\n[b]Current Features:[/b]\r\n[i]New NPCs with Unique Names\r\nNew Followers\r\nNew Locations/Interiors\r\nNew Items[/i]\r\n[center][IMG]http://i48.tinypic.com/b8w7l3.png[/IMG][/center]\r\n[b]Planned Features:[/b]\r\n[i]Fully Voiced NPCs\r\nUnique Dialogue\r\nFull Questline\r\nUnique Faction Armour\r\n\\'Roaming\\' NPCs[/i]\r\n[center][IMG]http://i48.tinypic.com/b8w7l3.png[/IMG][/center]\r\n[b]Install:[/b]\r\n[b]1.[/b] Download ImperialIntelligence.zip\r\n[b]2.[/b] Extract/unzip with Winrar or Winzip\r\n[b]3.[/b] Place extracted files into your skyrim/data directory\r\n[b]4.[/b] Activate TheOldGuard.esp\r\n[center][IMG]http://i48.tinypic.com/b8w7l3.png[/IMG][/center]\r\n[b]Uninstall:[/b]\r\n[b]1.[/b] Delete TheOldGuard.esp\r\n[center][IMG]http://i48.tinypic.com/b8w7l3.png[/IMG][/center]\r\n[b]Assistance Required:[/b] I require a couple of people to aid me in this endeavor!
