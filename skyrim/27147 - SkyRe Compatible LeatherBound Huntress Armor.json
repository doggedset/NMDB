  "summary": "SkyRe Compatible Patch for the LeatherBound Huntress mod",
  "descriptionHtml": "Installation:\r\n\r\nYou must first install the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11143]LeatherBound Huntress armor[/url] mod then download the compatibility patch and simply activate it in your plugin\\'s list instead of the original ESP. Make sure you load the patch after the SkyRe Main ESP.\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\nThis modifies all 3 variants of the armor.\r\n\r\nI adjusted the armor values it is now equal to Elven armor in SkyRE since it takes fox pelts to craft I felt it was acceptable. From the hood I removed the bonus to sneak. The hood also has about a third less armor value than a typical head piece. It is a hood after all and it keeps this leather set from being overall better than Elven armor, so the elven smithing perk isn\\'t useless. Added the requirement of the leather crafting perk to craft as well as tempering the armor. \r\n\r\nNo meltdown recipes this time, you\\'d only get leatherstrips anyways so it isn\\'t worth it at all to ever meltdown this armor so there was no point to make a plethora of meltdown recipes no one would use. \r\n\r\nThere is two versions of this mod the No Chest version which removes the chest from the original mod that had a bunch of free sets of this armor from Riverwood and the variant with the chest. Download which ever you\\'d prefer, if you download both make sure only one is active.\r\n\r\nCompatible with Version 0.99.21.1 of SkyRE\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to:\r\nT3nd0s for making Skyrim Redone\r\nShadowTroop for making LeatherBound Huntress",
