  "descriptionHtml": "Well, thats a Nord version of Urag gro-Shub with a little upgrade.\r\n\r\nI dont like much a Orc as mage and librarian. In the game orcs are a rejected race, so dont make sense keep an orc on Winterhold (in my opinion).\r\n\r\nThat\\'s the changes i have made :\r\n\r\n* Race change (Reaally ?) but the hairstyle, voice ,beard and eye color are the same.\r\n* Now, \\'\\'Urag\\'\\' uses  the Conjuration Master robes outfit ( Cause if he is wise, it more than obvious he is powerful)\r\n* Orc dagger changed to \\'\\'Staff of the Storm Atronach\\'\\'.\r\n* He can conjure all types of Atronachs\r\n* He uses only Lightning spells \r\n\r\nBasically is that. I hope you like it\r\n\r\n\r\n",
