As it happens, Auxentius is looking to\r<br />hire a brave warrior to help him in a rigorous and dangerous task. It appears a\r<br />shady underground mob boss by the name of Tolldar has plans to re-forge his\r<br />ancestor’s famous staff in an attempt to fulfil the prophecy of The Forgotten\r<br />Prince and become heir to the throne of the High King of Skyrim.

Whilst the[/size]\r<br />[size=3]mod received a 94% grade, due to time constraints and meeting the deadlines,[/size]\r<br />[size=3]our mod is far from fully polished. Make sure to save frequently to ensure no[/size]\r<br />[size=3]progress is lost if something goes wrong (the wrong NPC accidentally dies at[/size]\r<br />[size=3]the wrong time, for example).[/size]\r<br />[size=3] [/size]\r<br />[size=3] [/size]\r<br />[b][u][color=#6fa8dc][size=5][center]What doesThe Forgotten Prince require?[/center][/size][/color]\r<br />[/u][/b]\r<br />[size=3]The Forgotten Prince only requires the Vanilla version of Skyrim.[/size]\r<br />[size=3]It does not require any DLC.[/size]\r<br />[size=3]It does not require any other mods.[/size]\r<br />[size=3]It should (untested) be fully compatible will all DLC and most popular mods.[/size]\r<br />[size=3] [/size]\r<br />[b][u][color=#8e7cc3][size=5][center]How to start The Forgotten Prince/What level should you be?[/center][/size][/color]\r<br />[/u][/b]\r<br />[size=3]To start The Forgotten Prince, travel in any way you like (Fast travel, carriage, walking etc.) to Morthal.

However, it is worth noting that current [/size][size=3]feedback for the mod is that the enemies aren’t quite tough enough, so it is [/size][size=3]recommended that you play a lower level character if possible.[/size]\r<br />[size=3] [/size]\r<br />[b][u][color=#a64d79][size=5][center]Feedback/Questions:[/center][/size][/color]\r<br />[/u][/b]\r<br />[size=3]I would absolutely love to hear your feedback. Whilst we do not plan to update this mod, learning what was good and bad will greatly help [/size][size=3]us out in any future work we do.[/size]\r<br />[size=3]If you have any questions I would be more than happy to answer them in the discussion/post section below, or contact me at [/size][size=3]theinnocentpossum@hotmail.co.uk.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/DiNUv0B.jpg[/img]",
