  "descriptionHtml": "Nuno is an argonian warrior/tank follower.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;This is my first skyrim follower mod I have created. His max level is 100 and he starts at level 1, he is a pretty tanky follower later in the game but early game he isnt super strong so hes not overpowered in the start.\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;He can be found early in the game at [b][u]the Sleeping Giant inn[/u][/b] in [b]Riverwood[/b].\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;\r<br />&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy&#33;",
