  "summary": "A small batch file that used console commands to grant you Prowler&#39;s Profit.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Love the Prowler&#39;s Profit, but don&#39;t want to wander all over Skyrim, having to buy a mansion you&#39;ll never use, needing to join a school for abilities you&#39;ve no interests in, all to find some little pink rocks?  Then this is for you&#33;  \r<br />A way to gain the reward for all that nonsense is through the use of console commands.  To cheat and gain Prowler&#39;s Profit, open your console and enter the following:  \r<br />player.addspell 000f20be  \r<br />set TGProwlersProfit to 0  \r<br />That&#39;s it&#33;  Of if you&#39;re super lazy (or just don&#39;t want to keep trying to remember the commands for each new character you make), download the profit.zip file, extract the .txt, and place it in your default Skyrim directory (where your TESV.exe and skyrim_launcher.exe files are).  Start your game, open the console, and enter:  \r<br />bat profit  \r<br />Much, much easier.  Whichever method, .txt or manual, afterwards you&#39;ll need to enter another area or fast travel.  Prowler&#39;s Profit should now show up under your active effects, and chests/urns/burial urns should have a bit more gems.  \r<br />As it&#39;s a vanilla perk, I can&#39;t imagine it would be incompatible with anything, unless it changes this particular ability.  I have not tested what happens if you activate it, then start the Barenziah Stone quest afterwards.  I don&#39;t believe it would remove the power.  If so, just reactivate it.  If I later find this is the case, I&#39;ll update this description (but don&#39;t hold your breath).  Also the usual &#34;use at your own risk, save your game first, not responsible for whatever might  yadda yadda yadda...&#34; applies.",
