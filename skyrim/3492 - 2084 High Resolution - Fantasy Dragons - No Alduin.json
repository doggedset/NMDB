The textures in this pack are as follow.\r\n\r\nDragon - A jealous green.\r\nFrost Dragon - An utterly chilling blue.\r\nBlood Dragon - A fiendishly gruesome red.\r\nElder Dragon - A terrifying mythical creature.\r\nAncient Dragon - An almost volcanic beast.]\r\n\r\nUmad vanilla dragons?\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation is as follows..\r\n\r\nGo to your root skyrim folder which is probably located in one of the folders in your steam folder, you can find your steam folder in programs files which you can get to from double clicking your hard drive. See below\r\n\r\nStart Menu ----> My Computer -----> Hard drive -----> Program Files -----> Steam ---> ect.. \r\n\r\nIf this is to hard for you, go and look on another texture and you will find another tutorial on how to find it. :)\r\n\r\nBasically you extract the folder \\\"Data\\\" from the file Data.rar using winrar.  \\\"www.rarlab.com\\\"\r\n\r\nPut the folder \\\"Data\\\" in the same folder that has TESV.exe\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal step.. Play Skyrim. (:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to use and change them and add photos to this file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate... I need to recompile the ancient dragon...\r\n\r\n I\\'m so terribly sorry about that! *British Accent*\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following file names are relevant to the following dragons in case you want to keep certain ones.\r\n\r\nDragon.dds - Normal Dragon\r\nDragon_boss.dds - Ancient Dragon\r\nDragon_earth.dds - Elder Dragon\r\nDragon_snow.dds - Frost Dragon\r\nDragon_swamp.dds - Blood Dragon",
