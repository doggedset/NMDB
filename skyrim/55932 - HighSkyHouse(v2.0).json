And as always a sky-forge and other thing you&#39;ll need for crafting.\r<br />\r<br />You can find the spell book on the enchanting table and the 2 bottle of new poison next to the alchemy table.  \r<br />\r<br />you will need the dragonborn dlc and the latest skyrim update for it to run.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Lame team : http://lame.sourceforge.net/ and Flac team : http://xiph.org/flac/ for\r<br />Their great conversion tool.\r<br />\r<br />and the mod was supposed to be called zeushouse but when I finished it I was like it has nothing to do with Zeus so i changed the name you that’s why some files are called thing with Zeus in them.\r<br />\r<br />As always leave any suggestion at the post section.\r<br />Ps:\r<br />I have already uploaded this mod before but I messed up and uploaded the wrong file I’m so sorry and I apologize to anyone who downloaded the first version of this house mod ",
