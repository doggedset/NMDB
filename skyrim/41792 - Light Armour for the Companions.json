  "descriptionHtml": "Are you getting down from looking different from the other companion members because you wear light armour? Do you feel that you’re dressed as the run of the mill mercenary rather than a proud member of the honour-bound companions? Then this is the mod for you!\r\n\r\nThis simple mod adds a new light armour set with the appearance of the ancient nord armour that is rarely seen in the game except on those rotting Draugr. All companion members that actually wear light armour will wear this set of armour instead, giving the image that the companions have a set uniform for both light and heavy armoured users.\r\n\r\nThe companion’s light armour has the same stats as scaled armours; it can be crafted at a forge if you have the advanced armours perk and Eorlund Gray-Mane will also sell a set to you. \r\nI felt this mod was needed because it always annoyed me how Aela will wear ancient nord armour, which is heavy given she is an archer based character!\r\n\r\n[b][i][size=3]To Install: [/b][/i][/size]\r\n\r\nSimply extract the mod in your data folder and enable it via nexus mod manager or under the data files of the Skyrim launcher.\r\n\r\nFor the SkyRe users simply download the SkyRe version of the mod and follow the same steps as above.\r\n\r\n[b][i][size=3]Incompatibilities: [/b][/i][/size]\r\n\r\nWith mods that alter the armour of companion members that wear light armour, this includes Aela, Ria, Torvar, Athis and Njada.\r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions for the mod please feel free to suggest in the comments, this is my first mod so I welcome being called out on any mistakes or aspects of the mod that need to be corrected.\r\n\r\n[b][i][size=3]Requirements: [/b][/i][/size]\r\n\r\nNone, other than Skyrim.\r\n\r\n[b][i][size=3]Recommended mods:[/b][/i][/size]\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23754/?tab=1&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D23754%26preview%3D&pUp=1]Skirtless Male Draugr-Ancient Nord-Armor by Perraine[/url]\r\n\r\nIf you prefer a more up to date model of the armour that is less skirt like…\r\n\r\n\r\n",
