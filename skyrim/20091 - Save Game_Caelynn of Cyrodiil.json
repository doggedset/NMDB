  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first addition to the Skyrim Nexus site. I really enjoyed my latest character in Skyrim, and I thought others might find her as aesthetically pleasing and fun to play as I did. I’m someone that likes to get in depth with my character’s background – particularly with Caelynn. \r\nIf you enjoy the character, feel free to make up your own back story and post it in the comments! I’d love to hear about it! \r\nCaelynn’s original background: Caelynn, a native of the Imperial City, was sent to Skyrim by her father, a wealthy politician who wishes to gain imperial influence in all of Skyrim’s major cities. Who better to send than his beautiful, youthful, determined daughter? Unfortunately - upon her arrival in Skyrim, she stumbled upon a group of travelling Stormcloaks about to step into an imperial ambush. Nearly escaping death after Alduin ransacked Helgen, she started right where she left of – digging into every nook and cranny of Skyrim, establishing promising connections in every organization. \r\n\r\nRequired Mods: \r\n<a href=\\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/498\\\">High Quality Eyes by Xenius</a> \r\n<a href=\\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4708\\\">Triss Armor Re textured by Psyke23 </a>  \r\n<a href=\\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2666\\\">Calientes Female Body Mod</a> \r\n<a href=\\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812\\\">Better Females By Bella</a> \r\n<a href=\\\"http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\\\">ApachiiSKyHair by Apachii</a>\r\nSuggested Mod:\r\n<a href=\\\" http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15425 \\\">Stakado Cinemascope ENB </a>\r\nI tried to keep her character lore friendly as well as game friendly (no cheats), but you will see a few goodies in her bags! \r\nCheers! \r\n",
