  "summary": "Urdans are descendants of men who bred with the frost giants of Atmora.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Centuries ago, a race of barbaric men began to breed with the frost giants of Atmora to strengthen their bloodline. The goddess Kynareth, seeing this act as abominable smote these men, but could not bring herself to punish the innocent offspring. She spared the children, and they lived on to create a race now known as the Urdans.\r\n\r\nThe blood of an Urdan is cold as ice, a result of their frost giant heritage. This gives them a natural resistance to the cold. In addition, they are hardy folk, able to regenerate stamina faster than most race.\r\n\r\nFew Urdans exist to this day. They are generally looked down upon by other races because of their muddied bloodline, but they are fierce and intimidating warriors nonetheless.",
