  "descriptionHtml": "MurdermiesteR here with another terrible mod to shun. This one adds a speeder bike to Skyrim. Meshes and textures by myself. Find it outside Dawnstar. Head out of town, past the filthy kitty campground and keep movin for a short while. It will be off to the right. I suggest detect life.\r<br />It rides smooth and quick. It also gets pretty good air time, too.\r<br />\r<br />        &#34;Why so off and a pain to find?&#34;\r<br />\r<br /> No other mods are putting anything there or changing that world space....probably.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center] [credits] \r<br />Bethesda\r<br />Star Wars\r<br />3DS Max\r<br />NifSkope\r<br />Gimp\r<br />Nightasy tutorials\r<br />Nexus forums\r<br />MurdermiesteR (me)\r<br />And thanks to Kal-El the Kryptonian for advice and help with the CK retardedness.\r<br />[/center]\r<br />\r<br />     &#34;This mod sucks. And you suck for making it.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />Thank you for your input. Currently this mod is merely a hand made speeder weighted to a horse skeleton. Then it got a custom horse race named speeder bike to call home with bad references to used animations. I am working on getting the sounds to work. They are in the mod, I just haven&#39;t figured out wtf. Once they are working, I&#39;ll get some killer ones made to replace the ones in it. If you get them working and send me the esp or tell me wtf, I might send you some thing I made for my self....and of course credits. If you are a killer mod maker and want to rip my stuff off and make it bada&#036;&#036;, you are a bad person that.....that I&#39;ll endorse. I obviously want a speeder bike mod.",
