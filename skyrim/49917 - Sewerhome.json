  "summary": "A small starter-home for players outside of Riften. Why live in a nice house above ground, when you can live in a hole.",
  "descriptionHtml": "A small house I made for my new character in Skyrim. This is my first mod ever made, so there&#39;s probably a few problems here and there. All storage containers do not re-spawn, so they are safe for storing your items. Followers will not follow you in. It&#39;s kinda a good thing, because it&#39;s a tight squeeze to begin with&#33;\r<br />The entrance to the house is located South of the Riften stables; right underneath the Honeyside patio door.\r<br />Note: This mod requires both the Dragonborn and Hearthfire DLCs. Also should help if your Skyrim is up-to-date.\r<br />\r<br />Home Features:\r<br />-Storage: Named storage for Food, Potions, and Leather; A safe and strongbox; Three chests; Three barrels; a dresser, and a shelf for 10 books.\r<br />-Crafting: There is an Alchemy Lab, a Tanning Rack, and a Cooking Pot for use.\r<br />-Other: A player-owned bed; 2 Dagger display cases; and a Weapon plaque. \r<br />\r<br />",
