  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p483/8383Willow/Kilea1.jpg[/img]\n<br />Kilea is a beautiful Nord Dragonborn. (Level 1 - saved right after your Escape from Helgen - \"UNBOUND\")\n<br />With her unique face/beauty she looks good with all kinds of makeup and haircolors (take a look at her example IMAGES!!!) \n<br />\n<br />She already wears a forsworn armor - I have included it in her savegame because the headdress is the perfect \"hairstyle\" for her. \n<br />(If you don't want to \"cheat\" just drop the 4 forsworn items and play a totally regular game with her)\n<br />I have saved her with neutral makeup and grey eyes - so everyone can customize her as he/she wants to!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p483/8383Willow/Feedback_2yellow.jpg[/img]\n<br /> . . . (comments, uploaded images, constructive critizism, . . .)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Official HD DLC Pack Compatibility - Step by Step Guide\n<br />If you are using the official HD_Texture_Pack you have to follow this little guide to make it compatible with my Savegame \n<br />(because the used Texture-Mods would not show up otherwise)! Dont worry - it is really simple and safe - just follow the 4 steps: \n<br />\n<br />1. Go to your Skyrim.ini, usually located in Documents/My Games/Skyrim. Make a backup!\n<br />2. In the Skryim.ini find the section called [Archive], and add the information for the HiResTexturePack.bsa files so that it looks exactly like this:\n<br />\n<br />[Archive]\n<br />sResourceArchiveList=Skyrim - Misc.bsa, Skyrim - Shaders.bsa, Skyrim - Textures.bsa, HighResTexturePack01.bsa, HighResTexturePack02.bsa, Skyrim - Interface.bsa, Skyrim - Animations.bsa, Skyrim - Meshes.bsa, Skyrim - Sounds.bsa\n<br />sResourceArchiveList2=Skyrim - Voices.bsa, Skyrim - VoicesExtra.bsa\n<br />\n<br />3. Save the .ini with the new settings\n<br />4. Disable/Delete HiResTexturePack01.esp and HiResTexturePack02.esp\n<br />You don't need them anymore to run the dlc-textures because of the above .ini changes.\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p483/8383Willow/Kilea_Mods.jpg[/img]\n<br />To customize her and to get the different looks from the image section you need to downlaod the following 4 mods:\n<br />\n<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; Headdress retexture - my own mod to improve the look of the female forsworn headdress \n<br />Download your favorite color here (NONREPLACING - All-in-ONE file available!): [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5865]sexy Real Dreadlocks[/url] - Kileas whole look depends on these new textures and colors!\n<br />\n<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; Face + LaceWarpaint: [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3563]Coverwomen[/url] choose a natural version (I recommend look 3 - but you can also download the old version nr.1)\n<br />make sure you download the LACE-WARPAINT (under optional files)\n<br />\n<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; Body-Skintone: [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=18]No Dirty Bodies[/url] for her skin - best matching skintone for the \"coverwomen\"-face retexture\n<br />\n<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; Eyes: [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4869]Covereyes[/url] (I really like them but you can also use another type of HD-eye textures...)  \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p483/8383Willow/Kilea_ingame.jpg[/img]\n<br />To change Kilea's looks (Make-up, Eyecolor, Skincolor, NAME) ingame you have to use the game console (its really easy!):\n<br />\n<br />1. to open the console use the tilde-key (~) (left side - above TAB)\n<br />\n<br />2. type in:   showracemenu\n<br />\n<br />3. klick the tilde-key again to close the console\n<br />\n<br />4. now you can change her to your likings in the character menu \n<br />(just like you would with a normal new character at the beginning of the game)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p483/8383Willow/Kilea_Recommended.jpg[/img]choose a nice (lace)warpaint for her - you can use my pictures to see which colors/styles match her different haircolors best,...\n<br />\n<br />choose her eyecolor - matching or contrasting her haircolor \n<br />\n<br />change the color of her lips (mouth-section)\n<br />\n<br />if you want you can also change her skintone and adjust her weight\n<br />\n<br />5. press R when you are done - and give her a name (Kilea or whatever you like!) - press enter!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Play the game with your new beautiful, customized Dragonborn!\n<br />\n<br />:)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Please leave a comment if you like this savegame! \n<br />\n<br />Upload pictures of your Kilea and her Skyrim-Adventures!\n<br />\n<br />Credits to all modders who created the wonderful mods I used for character creation and screenshots. \n<br />A special THANK YOU to [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=2788925]mrLenski[/url] - I'm a big fan of his mods - they totally agree with my understanding of \"beauty\" ;))\n<br />\n<br />For more infos, mods and images visit my profile: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/938388]83Willow[/url]\n<br />[img]http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p483/8383Willow/Kilea2.jpg[/img]",
