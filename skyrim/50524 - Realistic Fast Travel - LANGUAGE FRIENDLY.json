  "descriptionHtml": "Did you ever find that vanilla fast travel is too fast? It takes about three in-game hours to go move from Witherun to Windhelm... just without talking about horses. Thi is generally the reason for many users do not use fast travel and prefer a realistic walk, even if walking for the same road several times can be [b]very[/b] annoyng.\r<br />I tried to use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19389/]Fast travel timescale fix[/url] by Hexaae, but for me it increased the speed, so fast travel became a real teleport. So I decided to make my own mod.\r<br />\r<br />If you use immersive/realistic mods like [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11163/]Frostfall[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26228/]RND[/url], you sholdn&#39;t miss this mod too.\r<br />\r<br />[b]WHAT THIS MOD DOES[/b]\r<br />[i]Realistic Fast Travel[/i] sets the speed multiplier to 0.437500 (vanilla is 1.000000).\r<br />I adjusted the speed of fast travel so it fits exactly the time it would take [i]walking[/i] from a place to another.\r<br />\r<br />[b]INSTALL/UNINSTALL[/b]\r<br />Use NMM or simply put the &#34;[i]Realistic Fast Travel.esp[/i]&#34; file in your C:/.../Skyrim/Data folder.\r<br />Delete the .esp file or use NMM to uninstall.\r<br />\r<br />[b]CONFLICTS[/b]\r<br />All mods that modify [i]fFastTravelSpeedMult[/i] value.\r<br />If you use Frostfall, I suggest to disable Frostfall&#39;s fast travel manager with MCM.\r<br />\r<br />[b]LANGUAGES[/b]\r<br />No strings are modified in this mod, so it&#39;is compatible with all languages&#33;",
