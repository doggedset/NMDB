  "summary": "Changes the appearance of several characters to be more appealing to the eye. Also fixes missing relationships between several characters.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod changes the appearance of several characters in-game to look a little more appealing to the eye. It also fixes several missing relationships. At the moment it&#39;s a Work In Progress so any suggestions are welcome. \r<br />\r<br />(also on Steam Workshop. Same name, same author, less frequently updated)\r<br />\r<br />Currently changed: \r<br />\r<br />Characters: \r<br />- Lokir (what can I say? something about his face irritated me, also changed his clothes to something more realistic) \r<br />- Aela the Huntress (Made to look more like a huntress also changed eye color and warpaint. preview image isn&#39;t showing warpaint because I apparently have a mod that&#39;s conflicting with it.)\r<br />- Ulfric Stormcloak (Tried to make him a bit more regal looking. Might have to tweak it more later. Also changed his clothes&#39; texture&#33;) \r<br />- General Tullius (Needed to be able to see his facial hair and he needed to look more...veteran-ey)\r<br />- Aringoth (made properly a Bosmer) \r<br />- Enthir (made properly an Altmer) \r<br />- Uthgerd The Unbroken (Made her younger and look a little more wild, giving multiple possible definitions to &#34;The Unbroken&#34; Also changed her armor to Scaled to improve her appearance and make her look more wild) \r<br />- Legate Rikke (Unified her appearances. She no longer has two completely different faces) \r<br />- Spectral Assassin (Properly named him Lucian Lachance, may tweak name later, changed his armor to the Ancient Shrouded Armor because it makes more sense. Also tweaked his &#34;non dead&#34; model a little but it&#39;s probably not noticable) \r<br />- Lydia (black, shortish hair did NOT suit her. Made it long and dark brown) \r<br />- Faendal (it&#39;s ok if you don&#39;t remember him. He&#39;s in riverwood. He was fugly. Now he&#39;s kinda-sorta less.) \r<br />- Proventus (the Steward in Whiterun. I didn&#39;t like his clothes so I changed them) \r<br />- Eorlund Grey Mane (Now wears a different set of armor because the best smith in skyrim shouldn&#39;t be running around in...whatever that was) \r<br />- Every Housecarl (Now wears the armor of the hold they&#39;re from, minus the helmet. May have missed one/some, it didn&#39;t feel like I edited enough things. Let me know.) \r<br />- Sapphire (Made her a more believable thief in appearance and look a bit younger to denote her actual age)\r<br />- Vex (Removed the ton of Make-up Bethesda slapped on her, and changed her hairstyle to make her look more...professional)\r<br />- Arnbjorn (basically just darkened his hair and made his eyes yellow)\r<br />- Astrid (Not really enough to be worth mentioning, but putting it here in case someone DOES notice)\r<br />- Sheogorath (No more blind eyes. Now gold like they should be. Hairstyle also changed because the other one was slightly off)\r<br />- Nocturnal (removed all red from her makeup, replaced with blue, changed hairstyle)\r<br />- All of the members of &#34;The Circle&#34; now wear the companions armor (Excepting Aela The Huntress who wears light armor)\r<br />- All members of the thieves guild now wear standard Thieves Guild armor (excepting Brynjolf, Delvin, Mercer, Vex, and Karliah)\r<br />- All members of the Dark Brotherhood (excepting Babette who the robes/armor are too big for) now wear either the Shrouded Armor or the Shrouded Robes\r<br />\r<br />Armor Textures: \r<br />- Ulfric&#39;s Armor \r<br />- Shrouded Armor \r<br />- Shrouded Robes \r<br />- Ancient Shrouded Armor \r<br />\r<br />Misc: \r<br />Fixed non-existant relationships between several related characters. (What? You&#39;ve never heard of each other? He&#39;s your brother&#33;) \r<br />- To Be Specific: \r<br />- Maul and Dirge are now flagged as brothers \r<br />- Mjoll and Maven are now flagged as Foes \r<br />- Farkas and Vilkas are know flagged as Brothers \r<br />- Aela and Skjor are now Flagged as Allies \r<br />- Hroki and Hreinn are now flagged as Brother and Sister \r<br />- Gormlaith Golden-Hilt and Hakon-One Eye are Flagged as Brother and Sister \r<br />- Delvin is now flagged as Sapphire&#39;s Uncle (Secret) \r<br />- Alduin and paartthunax are now Flagged as Brothers \r<br />Other\r<br />- Shadowmere made invulnerable as she should be\r<br />\r<br />Please note: I post changelogs 1 version ahead of the current so that I can keep track of what I&#39;ve done so far. Feel free to comment on them.",
