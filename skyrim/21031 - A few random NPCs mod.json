They can be found around Riverwood, and the outskirts of Whiterun.\r\n\r\nThis mod is only for immersion purposes. They don\\'t have any quests at the moment, only a story to tell. \r\n\r\n/tomme25\r\n\r\nPlease tell me if something isn\\'t working as it should!\r\n\r\nVideo preview:\r\n[youtube]MUjMXWgBEOQ[/youtube]",
