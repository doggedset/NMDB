  "descriptionHtml": "When he\\'s not planning for the Civil War, General Tullius is relaxing in his vacation home located southwest of Dragon Bridge, next to Bruca\\'s Leap Redoubt.  The house has a great view. You can sit on the deck and look at the river. It\\'s also spouse-friendly so you can move your spouse in there if you have the \\\"Spouses Can Live Anywhere\\\" mod. \r\n\r\nThe key to the home is located in Tullius\\'s bedroom in Castle Dour of Solitude.  I also added a couple little notes in his bedroom in Castle Dour and in the house.\r\n\r\nThe house includes:\r\n\r\nMain Floor\r\n-------------\r\nSpa room\r\nKitchen\r\nBedroom\r\nBathroom\r\nCooking Spit\r\n\r\nUpstairs\r\n--------------\r\nLibrary with 4 working bookshelves\r\nEnchanting table\r\nAlchemy table\r\n\r\nBasement\r\n---------------\r\n8 Mannequins\r\n6 Dagger display cases\r\n3 Weapon display cases\r\n9 Weapon racks\r\nSmithing supplies - forge, grinding stone, workbench\r\nTanning Rack\r\n\r\nNote: General Tullius is not included in this house. \r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1\r\n\r\n-Fixed a bug where the weapon racks wouldn\\'t let you take the weapon after storing them.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nVERSION 1.2\r\n\r\nNOTE: Remove all books from the bookshelves, clothes from the mannequins, weapons from the weapon racks, and items from the chests before installing.\r\n\r\nI updated the outside so it looks much nicer. Some things I added include:\r\n\r\n-Flower garden with a gazebo & fountain\r\n-A dock with a boat\r\n-Stable with a horse\r\n-Vegetable garden\r\n-Camping & picnic area\r\n-Outdoor bar\r\n-Hot tub\r\n-Archery targets\r\n-Woodcutting logs\r\n\r\nI had to bulldoze the forsworn camp that was in the way of my garden. The dungeon is still there. Just follow the path up the road to the cave.\r\n",
