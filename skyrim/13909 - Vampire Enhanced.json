  "descriptionHtml": "First of all English is not my native language, so forgive me for any bad typo you will read, also this is my first attempt to make a functional mod.\r\nI liked the idea of being a vampire, but let\\'s be honest, becoming one brought more drawback then profit, so the purpose of this mod is to make the vampire role a bit more enjoyable and less painful; now let\\'s start with the features:\r\n\r\n*Small Update* Added Vampire Enhanced 1.1 Variant as requested, in this version \\\"Weakness to Sunlight\\\" it\\'s enabled on stage 3 and 4, the other features are still avaiable.\r\n\r\n*UPDATE* New Version 1.1 Avaiable, with the following features:\r\n- Added \\\"Vampire Blizzard Cloak\\\" Power for each stage (base damage 10/20/30/40, time duration 1st-3rd 60, 4th 120 seconds), the last level power can be used indefinitely\r\n- Revised \\\"Champion of the Night\\\" now it\\'s effect is increased along with progression stages (from a static 25% to 25/50/75/100%)\r\n- Added Vampiric Magicka and Stamina Drain, their power increase with each progression stage (base damage 6/9/12/15)\r\n- Raised level cap of all Vampire thralls powers and their time duration (from 6/13/21/30 to 10/25/45/100 and from 60 to 300)\r\n- The stage 4 vamprie thralls can be used indefinitely (no once per day restriction), plus the corpse will not become ash so you can reanimate them again and again, and can be used on both npc and creatures as well (while the dead thrall spell has a level cap of 40 and work only on npc)\r\n- Disabled \\\"Weakness to Sunlight\\\" so any vampire character will no loger fear any reduction stat during the day\r\n- Increased Vampiric Drain Spell Power (from 2/3/4/5 to 6/9/12/15)\r\n- Raised level cap and time duration of \\\"Vampire\\'s Seduction\\\" (from 8 and 30 to 12 and 60)\r\n- Increased time duration of \\\"Embrace of Shadows\\\" (from 180 to 240)\r\n\r\nFuture plans:\r\n- Improving general stuff (like even more unarmed damage or so)\r\n- Adding new ability, powers and spells via vampirism progression stage (although I\\'m still learning how to make a successful script, so don\\'t expect this to come right away\r\n\r\nNOTE: Although there are plenty of mods in which the vampire progression stage is reversed (1st stage strong - 4th stage weak), this one will keep the original progression level (so 1st stage weak - 4th stage strong), I don\\'t plan to make a variant of my mod with reversed stage progression (at least in the near future), so don\\'t hold your breath.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY NOTE: This file is made from scratch, no mod was involved in the process.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n- MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR SAVE FILE - It\\'s always important to make a backup before testing/using any mod\r\n- MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR WHOLE SCRIPTS FOLDER FIRST - From now on this mod (starting from 1.1 version) WILL ALTER the original vampire vanilla scripts, so backup that folder! I warned you.\r\n- Extract the archive, place it\\'s content in your skyrim/data folder and select yes to all when asked, then open the launcher and be sure that the \\\"Vampire Enhanced.esp\\\" file is checked on data files\r\n- Play the game from the launcher or from the skse loader\r\n- Each time you update this mod, you need to feed or advance your vampirism stage to see the new spells/ability added.\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL INFO\r\n- If DATA FILES is Grayed out:\r\nGo on your save folder (default: Documents\\\\My games\\\\Skyrim), open with notepad the file \\\"skyrimprefs.ini\\\", check the line \\\"bEnableFileSelection=1\\\" under [Launcher], if the number is 0 set it to 1, if you don\\'t see the line simply add it, then save (DO NOT ALTER OR DELETE ANYTHING YOU ARE NOT SURE ABOUT)\r\n\r\nCONFLICTS\r\n- This mod will conflict with any mod which alter the vampire class/gameplay\r\n\r\nUNINSTALL\r\n- Delete \\\"Vampire Enhanced.esp\\\" file\r\n\r\nCHANGELOG HISTORY\r\n\r\n1.1 (currently version)\r\n- Added \\\"Vampire Blizzard Cloak\\\" Power for each stage (base damage 10/20/30/40, time duration 1st-3rd 60, 4th 120 seconds)\r\n- Revised \\\"Champion of the Night\\\" now it\\'s effect is increased along with progression stages (from a static 25% to 25/50/75/100%)\r\n- Added Vampiric Magicka and Stamina Drain, their power increase with each progression stage (base damage 6/9/12/15)\r\n\r\n1.0 Initial release\r\n- Raised level cap of all Vampire thralls powers and their time duration (from 6/13/21/30 to 10/25/45/100 and from 60 to 300)\r\n- The stage 4 vamprie thralls can be used indefinitely (no once per day restriction), plus the corpse will not become ash so you can reanimate them again and again, and can be used on both npc and creatures as well (while the dead thrall spell has a level cap of 40 and work only on npc)\r\n- Disabled \\\"Weakness to Sunlight\\\" so any vampire character will no loger fear any reduction stat during the day\r\n- Increased Vampiric Drain Spell Power (from 2/3/4/5 to 6/9/12/15)\r\n- Raised level cap and time duration of \\\"Vampire\\'s Seduction\\\" (from 8 and 30 to 12 and 60)\r\n- Increased time duration of \\\"Embrace of Shadows\\\" (from 180 to 240)\r\n\r\nRegard any permission notes \r\n- I\\'d like to not see this mod in any other site, I want to keep this as a Nexus only exclusive, also ask me before adding new features/editing something if uploading it here or on steam workshop.\r\n\r\nRegarding Credits\r\n- Bethesda for releasing this incredible game and the Creation Kit\r\n- Nexus being an awesome site/forum\r\n- You, who read till here \r\n\r\nFeel free to write comments and suggestions, also if you like this mod please endorse it, at first I did this for myself, later I thought if people may like to try it, so endorsing is an incentive to improve the quality of this mod.",
