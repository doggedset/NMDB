  "descriptionHtml": "Hello, i made this mod because i like the Homerun MOD thats in \"DeadIsland Riptide\".\n<br />this MOD allows you to send enemy's flying!.\n<br />I could not record this in action, due too my slow Pc and Internet(100kbs max),\n<br />But i do have pictures of a dark elf and a giant flying haha.\n<br />I made sure to add the effect to all WarHammers, so you can choose what one you like.\n<br />The chest is located in riverwood, by the saw mill.\n<br />the effect can send enemys flying but not too far, i tried to give it more force with magnitude,\n<br />but that did nothing, i would like someone to help me with this.\n<br />I used the \"Unrelenting Force\" Script to make this work, nothing is changed, just the items name,\n<br />Value, and description, I hope you like it as much as i do.\n<br />(See \"Non-Flyable\" for more info)\n<br />(the effect does not work if your hit kills them, idk why)\n<br />\n<br />|------------LOCATION------------|\n<br />Riverwood (see Pictures for location)\n<br />\n<br />|------------Features------------|\n<br />effect added to Every Warhammer in Skyrim/dawnguard/dragonborn.\n<br />\n<br />|------------Non-Flyable------------|\n<br />Mammoths\n<br />Dragons\n<br />Horses.....\n<br />\n<br />|------------Requirements------------|\n<br />Skyrim.\n<br />Dawnguard.\n<br />Dragonborn.\n<br />\n<br />|------------Install------------|\n<br />Use Nexus Mod Manager\n<br />\n<br />|------------Permission------------|\n<br />You have Permission to open my mod with the creation kit to see how i made this mod,\n<br />so you can apply the effect to what ever weapon you want, no need to credit me if you,\n<br />upload you mod, as i only copied and edited.\n<br />\n<br />|------------Thanks------------|\n<br />Bethesda for Skyrim, Creation kit,",
