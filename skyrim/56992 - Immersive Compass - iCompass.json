  "descriptionHtml": "[u][heading]MOD INFO[/heading][/u]\r<br />[color=#00ffff]What is iCompass?[/color]\r<br />Immersive Compass, or simply iCompass, is a small mod that makes some subtle changes to your compass, in an effort to provide you a more immersive feeling in your travels. From now, your compass makes more sense, by behaving like how any real compass could: you will have to actually rely on your maps for finding your destinations, as the iCompass hides the immersion-breaking [color=#ffe599]Discovered Location Markers[/color] and [color=#ffe599]Undiscovered Location Markers[/color]. The iCompass prevents your Compass from stealing some of the Map&#39;s role in navigation, and aims to bring realism to your journeys.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center]Since it&#39;s a commonly asked question, I&#39;ll answer it here: Yes, iCompass is[color=#00cc00] [/color][color=#00ff00]very compatible[/color] with [color=#00ffff]SkyUI[/color] and [color=#00ffff]iHUD[/color] and any other HUD mods out there&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/31450-1-1397968738.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />A video that demonstrates iCompass to the game (thanks to [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/11654708-vatiwah/]VatiWah[/url]&#33;)\r<br />[color=#00FF00][youtube]1aIHrCBDdTo[/youtube][/color]\r<br />Another demonstration video (thanks to [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/5076034-misalen]misalen[/url]&#33;)\r<br />[color=#00FF00][youtube]LcEaSBqEnUg[/youtube][/color]\r<br />[color=#00FF00][/color]\r<br />[color=#00FF00][/color][/center][u][u][heading]MOD DETAILS[/heading][/u]\r<br />[/u]You might think that this mod makes the compass more or less worthy of use, or turns the compass totally useless. But this is a wrong perspective of view&#33; A compass without location markers is still a compass. It is as worthy as Archery is without the crosshair&#33; If you learn to travel in the game&#39;s world without the compass&#39; location map markers, and just check your actual map every a while during your journeys, adds to the difficulty of the game&#33; You will be surprised how much more rewarding and realistic the navigation (and exploration) in Skyrim becomes. The Compass&#39; four main directional letters (E)ast, (W)est, (S)outh, (N)orth greatly help in orientating yourself through the game&#39;s world. If you give it a chance, and learn to navigate yourself with a real compass, then, nothing will be able to stop you from becoming a great explorer&#33; That is the concept behind the immersive compass&#33;[u]\r<br />\r<br />[/u]- - - - - - - - - - - - -[u]\r<br />\r<br />[/u]The iCompass, unlike most of the HUD mods out there, does not modify  the hudmenu.swf and hudmenu.gfx files at all. It uses an .esp file method instead of directly editing these files. Because of the sublime nature of the iCompass mod, the players can -finally&#33;- use more than one HUD mods that modify the compass at the same time, without getting any conflicts or errors in their games&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Until now, it was impossible for the players to use more than one HUD mods in their games, because most of the HUD mods out there, were using the method of editing the hudmenu.swf and hudmenu.gfx files directly, which was the cause of conflicts between these HUD mods. But worry no more&#33; With the iCompass, which make changes to the Compass only via a simple .esp plugin, the players are given greater flexibility in modifying their HUDs without getting any conflicts between different HUD mods&#33; iCompass ensures full compatibility with any other HUD mods out there. \r<br />\r<br />[b][u]What the iCompass does:[/u][/b]\r<br />[list][*]Removes the Discovered (Known) Location Markers from being displayed on the compass.[/*]\r<br />[*]Removes the Undiscovered (Unknown)  Location Markers from being displayed on the compass.[/*]\r<br />[*]Remains HUD-neutral. This prevents iCompass from conflicting with other mods that make changes to the compass. The players can finally tailor their compass to their tastes, by using two or more HUDs mods at a time.\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[b][u]What the iCompass does NOT:[/u][/b]\r<br />[list][*]It does not remove the N, S, W and E directions from being displayed on the Compass. Without them, your compass makes no sense.\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]It does not hide the compass itself. (but the [color=#00ffff]iHUD[/color] mod does that, and it is very compatible with iCompass)[/*]\r<br />[*]It does not hide the Quest Markers from being displayed on the Compass. (but you can disable the Quest Markers yourself. To do that, simply open your [color=yellow]SkyrimPrefs.ini[/color] and change the [color=yellow]bShowQuestMarkers=1[/color] to [color=yellow]0[/color]. Alternatively, the [color=#00ffff]Hardcore Compass Mod[/color], the [color=#00ffff][color=#00ffff]Skyrim Compass Tuner[color=#ffffff] mod, or the [/color]Minimal HUD for Skyrim[/color][/color] mod can disable the Quest Markers for you, and all of them are very compatible with iCompass)\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]It does not hide the player&#39;s custom map markers from the compass. (but the [color=#00ffff][color=#00ffff]Less Intrusive HUD[/color][/color] mod can do that, and it is very compatible with iCompass)[/*]\r<br />[*]It does not remove the enemy&#39;s red dots from being displayed on the compass. (but the [color=#00ffff]No enemies on compass[/color] mod can do that, and it is very compatible with iCompass)[/*]\r<br />[*]It does not change the compass&#39; size to make it bigger or thicker. (but the [color=#00ffff][color=#00ffff]A Thinner Compass[/color][/color] mod can do that, and it is very compatible with iCompass)\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]It does not hide the Shout cooldown from the compass.[/*]\r<br />[/list][u]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[heading]COMPATIBILITY[/heading][/u]\r<br />My mod is designed with the goal of [color=#00ff00]full compatibility with any HUD, Map, or UI[/color] mods in your game&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[u]The Immersive Compass - iCompass is:[/u]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]SkyUI[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]iHUD[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]A Matter of Time[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]A Quality World Map - With Roads[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]MoreHUD[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]Minimal HUD for Skyrim[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]Less Intrusive HUD[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]Less Intrusive HUD II[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]A Thinner Compass[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with[color=#00ffff] Map HUD Enhanced[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]ipHUD - Complete Edition v2[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]1080 Smaller ipHUD[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]NoHUD[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]Skyrim Compass Tuner[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]No enemies on compass[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]Hardcore Compass Mod[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]Colored Compass Markers[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]No more location markers on Compass[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]LiHUDMap[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]No GPS players map arrow marker[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]No GPS arrow[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]High Quality 3D Map[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]Atlas Map Markers for Skyrim Blackreach Dawnguard and Dragonborn[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]Warburgs 3D Paper World Map[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]EzEs -Colored Map Markers[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]The Cartographers Map Markers[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]any mods that change the hudmenu.swf file[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]any mods that change the hudmenu.gfx file.[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]any HUD, UI or Map mods not mentioned here.[/color]\r<br />[color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with [color=#00ffff]all 3000+ mods out there not mentioned in this list.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />With simple words, my mod is [color=#00cc00]100%[/color] compatible with anything&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][heading]MOD REQUIREMENTS[/heading][/u]\r<br />No mod dependencies or requirements.
