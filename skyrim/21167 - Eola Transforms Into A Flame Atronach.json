  "descriptionHtml": "[center][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/oF1Uq.png[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\nThis mod turns Eola into a Flame Atronach whenever she enters a battle, and obviously she returns to normal Eola form whenever a battle is over.\r\n\r\nI created my first mod  \\\"Temptress Vixen Transforms Into A Flame Atronach\\\" http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20819/ and had a request to have Eola to do the same. So here it is.\r\n\r\nAdded two versions of Eola.\r\n\r\nThe first has a Flame Explosion transformation effect, but it was a frame rate killer for me. Maybe it will be different for you.\r\n\r\nThe second is with the original Red Smoke, like the Temptress version, to save frame rates.\r\n\r\nCheck out the video here: \\\"Temptress Vixen Transforms Into A Flame Atronach\\\" http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/20819/ to see the Red Smoke transformation effect. Or check the video tab of this mod.\r\n\r\nThe Flame Explosion is all visual, it causes no damage. I did that because some of your others followers might get mad if they catch fire every time Eola is in a fighting mood.\r\n\r\n[center][youtube]tnhioFSD0i4[/youtube][/center]\r\n\r\nTo install, extract the file contents to your data folder, although the NMM should work. Let me know if it doesn\\'t.\r\n\r\nIf you want to change between the transformation effect versions to test them out you must do a CLEAN save.\r\n\r\nCLEAN SAVE! CLEAN SAVE! CLEAN SAVE!\r\n\r\nNot a Quick Save.\r\n\r\nCreate a new save.\r\nUninstall the mod.\r\nStart the game and make a SECOND new save. Quit game.\r\nAdd the version you want (Red Smoke or Flame Explosion) and rock on!\r\n\r\n[center][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/1XUSq.png[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\nAny weapons that you give her, she will drag it at her feet in  Flame Atronach form.  She doesn\\'t need any weapons anyway since she transforms into a  Flame Atronach.\r\n\r\nThe Flame Atronach has no stagger animations, so when Eola gets to zero hit points, she will just stand there in Flame Atronach form doing nothing. So if you are wondering why she is just standing there not doing anything, it\\'s because she is trying to recover health.\r\n\r\n[center][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/3l2MX.png[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\nTytanis for saving me at the last minute in a Nexus chat session.\r\n\r\nThe Nexus. I\\'m a Premium member for a reason! This is a great place with great people!\r\n\r\nAverage Porcupine on the Bethesda forum for helping me with the transformation effect. What a lifesaver!\r\n\r\nBethesda. ?? Mullon!",
