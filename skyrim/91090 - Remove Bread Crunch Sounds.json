  "summary": "Very simple mod that replaces the annoying bread crunching sound that permeates inns with a brief clip of silence.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod just replaces the bread crunching sound with a brief clip of silence.  I found instructions online a long time ago for replacing sound files and made this as the bread crunching was very annoying.  I can no longer remember where I saw the tutorial on removing sounds.  I figured I would upload this to save someone else the time.\n<br />\n<br />Even though I originally made this for Skyrim, I have used it on SkyrimVR and it works fine.  Since SkyrimVR is modified from Special Edition, this should be fine for SE also.\n<br />\n<br />Just unzip into your Skyrim directory and overwrite the files.  No ESP/ESM is used.",
