  "modName": "vwr Idle Markers SE - DELETED",
  "summary": "The only real difference from the Oldrim version is that there, the \"read\" idle had the flag \"ignored by sandbox\". I removed that flag for this version (thanks to Mookeylama for realizing this was the issue) so now it works as it should. The spell will be added to you automatically when you start the game.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[quote]Give yourself and NPCs a place to relax. They can now lay, sit, pray and read at your command, or when they have nothing better to do.   \n<br />\n<br />[youtube]5n0zzmMCd9ghttp[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />This mod adds a spell to your inventory which allows you to place markers that can be selected by NPCs and the player. These markers will\n<br />cause the character to sit, lay, read, and pray. This is an early release, but I'm not sure when I'm gonna work on it more. Use it to command your followers into these poses, or just give them somewhere to relax.\n<br />\n<br />When you load a saved game or start a new game, the spell will be added to your inventory. It's called \"Place Idle Marker\". Stand somewhere in Skyrim, cast the spell, then choose which type of marker you wish to place from the pop-up menu (sit, lay, read, or pray). The marker will be invisible so just look down at your feet to select it. Now you can use the marker, tell your follower to use it, or just watch idle NPCs randomly use it. If you want to delete the marker you created, just select it while sneaking.[/quote]",
