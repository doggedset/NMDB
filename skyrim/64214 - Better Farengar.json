  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Courier New][color=#000000][size=5]Better FarengarÂ \r<br />\r<br />[/size][/color][/font]I always hated the way Farengar looked, so I made him better. And got rid of that damn hood, lookin&#39; like a insecure stalker... I made him so he looks a little bit nicer and I changed some of his attributes like his weight and his face. He always looked like a skinny person needing to take a dump.\r<br />\r<br />He doesn&#39;t require any other mods, this is really simple. I didn&#39;t want to put my life and soul, because when you do that, it ends up looking like a barbie in Skyrim.",
