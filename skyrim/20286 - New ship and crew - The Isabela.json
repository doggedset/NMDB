  "descriptionHtml": "New version and more: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/41897/?\r\n\r\n I would like to share one of my mods. I built a ship at Sea of Ghosts. This ship has interior based on Icerunner. The crew of ship is neutral to player, but you can attack and fight with them if you like. There are several chests, but store your items only in these with \\\"(safe)\\\" in names (other barrels and sacks may respawn items). You can find a map with marked ships, shipwrecks, ports and treasures. You may use this place as player\\'s home.\r\nThe map marker leads directly to the ship (visible and available from the beginning).\r\n\r\n[i]Installation:[/i]\r\nput folder in X:.../steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/data\r\n[u]Important![/u] You must disable borders (ship is out of border). To make that find file \\\"Skyrim.ini\\\" in documents/my games/skyrim .Open it in notepad and under section [general] type\r\nbBorderRegionsEnabled=0\r\nand save file.\r\n\r\n[i]Update:[/i]\r\n~Now, you can travel straight away to ports in Riften, Solitude and Windhelm.\r\n~Added some items, clutters and critters.\r\n~Well hidden place inside the ship worth to find.\r\n~Trader on deck.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn future I will expand this. I would like to make this galleon sailing in real time, but it\\'s very difficult. \r\n\r\nDon\\'t fall down from crow\\'s nest. On board, landlubbers;)",
