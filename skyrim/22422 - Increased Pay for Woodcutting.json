  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=4]About this Mod[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />This mod is a very simple esp that increases the amount of money that can be made by chopping wood. In the vanilla game, firewood is only worth 5 gold each when turned when given to, for example, Hulda. Since the standard three chops for six peices of wood takes about 30 seconds, you are earning only 1 gold per second(minus the time it takes to turn the wood in) With the standard version this is quintupled. I think this is a huge improvement but stays away from being a cheat and is fairly balanced. I also made 10,15,20,30,40,50,75, and 100 gold options. The newest version, 1.2, also has 1,2,3 and 250 options. Use whichever one you want. [b]THIS MOD DOES NOT CHANGE THE BUYING/SELLING VALUE OF WOOD IN SHOPS.[/b] \r<br />\r<br />[center][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />Since I have only changed a single value, this should be compatible with literally everything. Put it wherever you want in the load order unless you are using another mod that changes &#34;JobsWoodValue&#34;. The only mod that I&#39;m aware of that does this is [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19281/?]Requiem[/url]. If you are unsure if a mod changes &#34;JobsWoodValue&#34; you can check using [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25859]TES5Edit[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=4]Recommended[/size][/center]\r<br />[center][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21132]Wood Chopping to Max Carry Weight[/url] by IsharaMeradin.[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][center]Installation[/center][/size]\r<br />The archive is setup for NMM installation and upon activating it in the manager will ask what version you want and will install it for you. If you prefer to install things manually you just drop the &#34;MorevaluableWood.esp&#34; into your data folder usually found in programfiles(x86)/steam/steamapps/common/skyrim. Note: If you use an optional version the esp will be named in order to tell which version it is for example the 100 gold version is &#34;MoreValuableWood(100).esp&#34; Do not load two different versions of this mod.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][center]Known Issues[/center][/size]\r<br />[center]None and I cannot possibly imagine there being any. As always, report any you find the comments.[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[center][size=4]My Other Mod[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37394]Destruction Perks Rebalanced[/url][/center]",
