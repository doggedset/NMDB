  "descriptionHtml": "The Ragmar Conspiracy\r\nA plot to kill a king wiped from history and now lost in the mists of time.\r\nBut nothing can ever by completely removed; a single copy of an ancient account of the events survived lying forgotten in a private library for centuries.\r\nForgotten until it was unearthed in a crate of old books, a crate of books given to the amateur historian Gulthar.\r\n\r\nTrack down Gultharâ€™s Journal and discover why he is in hiding in fear of his life.\r\nFollow the clues to find if any of the four Ragmar Tombs have survived the centuries.\r\nThen deal with those who want Gulthar dead.\r\n\r\nTo begin this search look for the note that Gulthar has left for you on the bar in the Bannered Mare in Whiterun.\r\n\r\nThis is my first mod; it is the first of the four Ragmar tombs. If people like it I will carry on with the other three.\r\n\r\nThe tomb is a new interior, so there should be no conflict problems. The only changes to existing world spaces are the tomb entrance, sited in an area away from all existing structures, but still easily accessible, and the placement of one note and one journal within world spaces. All further notes and journals will be in new interiors.\r\nThe tomb is fully navmeshed and optimised. \r\n\r\nVersion 1.1 Changes:\r\nOptimisation portal moved to address a vanishing floor section upon re-entering tomb\r\nLinen sheets moved to stop flickering\r\nFloating sarcophagus top lowered\r\nSlightly mis-aligned stair section re-aligned\r\n\r\n",
