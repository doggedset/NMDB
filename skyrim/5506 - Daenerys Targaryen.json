  "descriptionHtml": "Made for DonutAgeOrigins\r\n\r\nFeel free to offer feedback, this is just a rough start.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of limitations with what I can do with feature shapes (especially nose and mouth) without the CK. \r\n\r\nPics suck, load it up and try it in-game for best results. Shadows are really bad, especially around the jawline. I made the character in the creation screen, which as you know has a much more washed out and even lighting. Inspecting in-game will allow a better view, and maybe a greater appreciation.\r\n\r\nLike I said, it\\'s really rough, and most likely will be until the CK.\r\n\r\nMods used in pics\r\n\r\nXCE - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2356\r\nCBBE Slim - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\nBeauty Faces (my fav beauty mod) - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1329\r\nCoolsims Retex - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4400\r\n\r\nNow Emilia Clarke has some crazy beautiful eyebrows. In my games I use Eyebrows Match Hair - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=627, but if you don\\'t have this installed you\\'ll get the dark eyebrows from Emilia\\'s portrayal in GoT.\r\n\r\nCredits go to Bethesda for Skyrim, George R. R. Martin for ASoIaF, HBO for GoT, and Emilia Clarke for being so damned cute.\r\n\r\nanother discussion here http://www.skyrimnexus.com/imageshare/image.php?id=23095\r\n",
