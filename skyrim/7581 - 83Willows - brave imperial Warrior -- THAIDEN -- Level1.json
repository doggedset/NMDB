(comments, uploaded images, constructive critizism, . . .)[/color]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Saved right AFTER Helgen - Savegame includes a nice armor set which suits him perfectly in my opinion\n<br /> so you can enjoy the game as warrior from the first second on...\n<br />\n<br />(fur armor, steel horned helmet, steel cuffed boots, steel nordic gauntlets + steel greatsword)\n<br />\n<br />Level 1, Race IMPERIAL: Yes, I know he looks like a Nord - I wanted to create a Nord - but I couldn't get the desired look \n<br />- so I tried the imperial race next - their face structure looked much better for what I had in mind... thats the reason Thaiden is an Imperial  ;)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Official HD DLC Pack Compatibility - Step by Step Guide\n<br />If you are using the official HD_Texture_Pack you have to follow this little guide to make it compatible with my Savegame \n<br />(because the used Texture-Mods would not show up otherwise)! Dont worry - it is really simple and safe - just follow the 4 steps: \n<br />\n<br />1. Go to your Skyrim.ini, usually located in Documents/My Games/Skyrim. Make a backup!\n<br />2. In the Skryim.ini find the section called [Archive], and add the information for the HiResTexturePack.bsa files so that it looks exactly like this:\n<br />\n<br />[Archive]\n<br />sResourceArchiveList=Skyrim - Misc.bsa, Skyrim - Shaders.bsa, Skyrim - Textures.bsa, HighResTexturePack01.bsa, HighResTexturePack02.bsa, Skyrim - Interface.bsa, Skyrim - Animations.bsa, Skyrim - Meshes.bsa, Skyrim - Sounds.bsa\n<br />sResourceArchiveList2=Skyrim - Voices.bsa, Skyrim - VoicesExtra.bsa\n<br />\n<br />3. Save the .ini with the new settings\n<br />4. Disable/Delete HiResTexturePack01.esp and HiResTexturePack02.esp\n<br />You don't need them anymore to run the dlc-textures because of the above .ini changes.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p483/8383Willow/Thaiden_MODS.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2488]Better Males[/url] - you need to download the following 2 files from this mod: \n<br />\n<br />for his face - BetterMales - Faces - GeonoxFaces v1-1 (+use the smooth face option included in this file!)\n<br />\n<br />for his body: BetterMales - Underwear - Slip  (or if you prefer naked males - I recommend: BetterMales - BodiesNudes - SundraconMeshes)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />other recommendend mods:\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4869]Covereyes[/url] - or another HD-Eye retexture mod\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4307]AOF Believable Hair -Female and Male-[/url] - for a better hair structure\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p483/8383Willow/Thaiden_INGAME.jpg[/img]\n<br />If you want to change some details of Thaidens look ingame (eyecolor, warpaint, haircolor, hairstyle, Name) \n<br />you can use the game console (its really easy!):\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />1. to open the console use the tilde-key (~) (left side - above TAB)\n<br />\n<br />2. type in:   showracemenu\n<br />\n<br />3. klick the tilde-key again to close the console\n<br />\n<br />4. now you can change him to you likings in the character menu \n<br />(just like you would with a normal new character at the beginning of the game)\n<br />\n<br />5. Press R when you are finished - (re)name your character and press enter!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Enjoy Skyrim with your new imperial dragonborn!\n<br />\n<br />Thanks for downloading! \n<br />Please leave a comment if you enjoy playing with Thaiden \n<br />(You can also upload an image of your adventures with him!)\n<br />\n<br />:)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Credits:\n<br />To all Modders which created the beautiful mods I used in this savegames!\n<br />Bethesda - for great games!\n<br />\n<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />For more infos, mods and images visit my profile: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/938388]83Willow[/url]\n<br />[img]http://i1152.photobucket.com/albums/p483/8383Willow/Thaiden_End.jpg[/img]",
