  "summary": "Running Skyrim below recommended specs? Find that it usually runs fine, but certain areas make your FPS just drop to a crawl? Have no fear! Check out this list of ini tweaks and mods to help boost your performance, without killing visuals too much. You can trust me. I run a potato. O.O",
  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=4]Lag is a pain. Especially when you're not running a computer made to deal with games like Skyrim, even if it's a little old now. But thankfully, the Skyrim modding community and others have figured out many ways to reduce this issue as much as possible. I am aware that there are many lists like this already, but I thought I might make my own. Besides, you may find some mods and tricks that you've never heard of on here.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]~ INI ~[/b][/size]\n<br />First, we'll start with tweaking your INI settings. These have to do with... Well, pretty much everything in Skyrim, from LOD (level of detail) distance, to water, to bandits taunting at you. You can customize this by editing the Skyrim.ini and Skyrimprefs.ini files in Documents/My Games/Skyrim/ with a program like Notepad (make sure it runs as administrator), a utility called [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69787/]BethINI, [/url][/size][size=3][size=4]or using the Configurator or INI editor within [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334/]Mod Organizer[/url]﻿.[/size][size=5][color=#cc0000][b]\n<br />*** Make sure to backup your INI files before editing ***[/b][/color][/size]\n<br />[size=6][b][color=#741b47]//Skyrim.ini//[/color][/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b][Display][/b]\n<br />[b]iPresentInterval= 0 or 1[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=4][i]This setting lets you decide whether or not to cap your FPS at 60 to prevent\n<br /> screen-tearing, lag, instability, and bugs with Havok physics. \n<br />- If your computer refresh rate is 60 (you should be able to see this in your graphics settings), type 1 for this value\n<br />- If you use another means of limiting framerate (like with ENBoost), then this needs to be left at 0[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b] [Grass][/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3][b][size=5]iMinGrassSize= # (default: 20)[/size][/b][/size]\n<br />[size=4][i]This helps determine how dense (spread out) grass is.[/i]\n<br />[i]- If grass gives you FPS problems and/or you use flora mods, try raising \n<br />this value to 40, 60, 80, or 100 for a good FPS boost. I use a value of \n<br />100 for a decent balance between visuals and performance.[/i]\n<br />[color=#741b47][i][color=#990000]Warning: High values (such as 10000), can lead to CTDs.[/color][/i][/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]bAllowCreateGrass = 0[/size][/b]\n<br />[b][size=5]bDrawShaderGrass = 0\n<br />bGrassPointLighting = 0[/size][/b]\n<br />[size=4][i]These settings determine whether or not grass (or flowers from flora mods) will appear. This doesn't affect alchemy plants. Setting it to 0 will disable it. [/i][/size]\n<br />[b]\n<br />[size=5]fGrassWindMagnitudeMax = 0\n<br />fGrassWindMagnitudeMin = 0[/size][/b]\n<br />[size=4][i]These settings determine whether or not plants will sway in the wind. Disabling it may add a potential performance boost.[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]iMaxGrassTypesPerTexure = 5 (this is the proper spelling)[/size][/b]\n<br />[i][size=4]This setting determines how many types of grass/flowers you can see. The default setting is 2. Flora mods may ask for higher values for a slight FPS reduction.[/size][/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5] [LightingShader][/size][/b]\n<br />[b][size=5]fSpecularLODFadeEnd=# (default: 0.1000)[/size][/b]\n<br />[b][size=5]fSpecularLODFadeStart=# (default: 0.0900)[/size][/b]\n<br />[size=4][i]These settings help decide when specularity (shininess or wetness) of objects appear. I highly recommend you tweak this if you get lag when around NPCs, in caves, modded locations with lots of objects, and ESPECIALLY IN THE RAGGED FLAGON.[/i]\n<br />[i]- To disable specularity altogether, set both of these values to 0.0[/i]\n<br />[i]- Alternatively, you can just reduce these values [/i][/size][size=5][i][size=4]greatly to [/size][color=#741b47][color=#ffffff][size=4]0.0025, 0.0004, etc. [/size][/color]\n<br />[/color][/i][/size]\n<br />[b][size=5][Trees]\n<br />bEnableTreeAnimations = 0\n<br />fUpdateBudget = 0[/size][/b]\n<br />[i]These determine whether or not trees sway in the wind.
