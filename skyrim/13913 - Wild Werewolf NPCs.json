  "descriptionHtml": "This mod just adds a few werewolves to Skyrim (which Bethesda should have done itself).\r\n\r\nThere are a total of 8 werewolves. I don\\'t think they should be too common. \r\n\r\nIf your character is low level, you may want to avoid these monsters. They should level scale as you get more powerful, as well.\r\n\r\nPermissions\r\n\r\nDo what you want with this file. Just credit me as the original author. Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPOILERS\r\n\r\nWerewolf Locations\r\n\r\n\r\nWerewolves are found at:  the Alchemist\\'s Shack, Broken Fang Cave, Bronze Water Cave, Clearpine Pond, north of Fallowstone Cave, High Gate Ruins, above Reachcliff, and on the steps to Ysgramor\\'s Tomb.",
