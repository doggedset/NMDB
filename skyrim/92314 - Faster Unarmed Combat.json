  "summary": "This mod increases the default attack speed for unarmed combat. It's my first mod, and I was tired of punching slower than I could swing a dagger.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod aims to make unarmed combat more interesting by increasing the attack speed of unarmed fighting. Vanilla Skyrim unarmed attacks are really slow and clunky. This is a really lightweight fix for that issue. I nearly doubled the attack speed for hand-to-hand, making it a little more viable as a combat option against armed opponents.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />On the docket:\n<br />\n<br />MCM menu. Upon testing, I decided that it would be a good idea to add a menu and more customization options for Unarmed.\n<br /> Current ideas: \n<br />Slider for speed scaling and speed differentiation based on hand-wear.\n<br />Reach slider. Unarmed attacks don't reach very far, and it can at times be very difficult to hit large opponents like mammoths giants and dragons.",
