  "descriptionHtml": "[color=red]Sorry that I haven\\'t updated this mod in a while, I just have been so busy lately. Anyways, for anybody wondering, this mod hasn\\'t been abandoned and the future sewers are hopefully in the near future![/color]\r\n[color=red][u][b][size=5]Description[/size][/b][/u][/color]\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a very large system of tunnels under the city of Whiterun. In the tunnels you can access every cell in whiterun, the Whiterun Stables, and several exits to the city itself. The tunnels are also accurately scaled meaning that the distances between the buildings aboveground are the same as they are underground. The sewers are great for sneaky characters or anyone with a bounty on their head because you can safely maneuver under the city and remain out of sight. They are very well light right now but I will probably mess with the lighting of it later. As of right now the sewer isn\\'t navmeshed but it will be very soon. I will also add enemies, loot, a small quest, and a few other things for the future updates. Feel free to leave a comment about suggestions/bugs/ideas/ or any feedback. And as always don\\'t forget to endorse!\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/6888730/?tb=mods&pUp=1][b][size=5]Check Out My Mods[/size][/b][/url]",
