  "descriptionHtml": "Embark on a quest with new NPCs on a journey to find a special suit of armor crafted from the blood of Mehrunes Dagon. (From Oblivion). You will be set out on this quest from one of Dagon\\'s Daedric followers, located in Riverwood. From there you must find and kill the guardians that are protecting the pieces of armor. \r\n\r\nThis Mod also Includes:\r\n\r\nVirus Ice Barrier Spell (Pictured Above): Creates an ice barrier and absorbs the enemies health, transferring it to the player.\r\n\r\nSkeleton Army: Summon a small army of five skeleton warriors to protect you in battle. Requires additional mods.\r\n\r\nSword of Olympus: Overpowered sword that drains targets health, stamina, and magicka.\r\n\r\nPlus 10- 15 other weapons, armor, spells, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome spells require the Kanguilla Multiple Summons Mod (V1.0)\r\nQuest(s) is still in progress and may not complete as expected.\r\nVoice Over(s) have not been added yet....\r\n\r\n\r\nThe current main NPC is located in Riverwood. He will stand out. He can purchase stolen goods, and cannot be killed. He also takes great offense to members of the Thieves Guild. \r\n\r\n\r\nHe also is currently holding all the mod items that have been added so far. You can purchase them from him for a modest amount of gold. But be wary he is no push-over and really has an affection for your coin.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate to 1.1: Added Voice Over Place holder for main NPC (shalom). Will replace these later with higher quality renders. (Any voice actors please contact me if you are interested)\r\nAlso added a new theme song for the opening menu. Working to determine how volume of converted music file is determined outside of general settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
