  "descriptionHtml": "Adds a Spell Tome that allows the player to detect bunnies! Makes it a whole lot easier to increase your Bunnies Slaughtered stat.\r\n\r\nBunnies are still rare and this mod makes no effort to change that, but it will make it possible to detect bunnies from a distance.\r\n\r\nThe Tome should spawn in random loot, but for those that do not want to search, a copy has been placed at the entrance to Breezehome in Whiterun. Six bunnies have been added in the area around the Abandoned Shack for testing.\r\n\r\nMinor modifications were made to the bunnies in the Creation Kit, which was necessary to make this mod, but no important stats were changed. This mod should not conflict with any other mod. There are no dependencies.",
