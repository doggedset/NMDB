  "descriptionHtml": "Massive update for you contains : Lannister Armour, ASOIAF Races plus shields for each of         them and Night Watch shield, Roberts War-hammer, Ice and  Valyrian Battleaxe enjoy. :) \r\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nThe currently added races are:\r\n\r\nHouse Lannister - Find extra gold, can \\'Pay their Debts\\' to deal double damage whilst their             health is below 30\r\n\r\nHouse Greyjoy - Have a 50% disease resistance and can breathe underwater (if anyone has any better ideas for the ironmen, please let me know\r\n\r\nHouse Stark - 50% resistance to cold and the Starks can use the \\'On My Honour\\' ability to get others to fight for them\r\n\r\nHouse Martell - Poisons crafted by the Martells are 20% more effective and they have a powerful resistance to poison\r\n\r\nHouse Baratheon - The Baratheons have no natural resistances to boast of, but they can call the storm to destroy the enemies of Storm\\'s End, they can also use the Hero\\'s Roar to terrify their enemies into submission\r\n\r\nHouse Targaryen - Instead of a normal resistance to fire, whenever a Targaryen is hit by fire damage they have a 50% chance of resisting it entirely. This means that there\\'s a possibility of them getting the full amount of damage (Summerhall anyone?) but there\\'s also a chance that they can resist it entirely (Drogo\\'s Pyre?)\r\n\r\nPlus an easter egg in Riverwood. If you can find and kill the \\\"Mountain that Rides\\\" then take a picture and let me know in the comments how you killed him :)\r\nI cannot stress this enough,  back. up. those. saves. I love you guys, and this mod will turn into a full game of thrones mod. Fingers Crossed.\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n\r\n1.01\r\nSecond update, mainly bugfixes\r\n\r\n1.00\r\nFirst release, races added",
