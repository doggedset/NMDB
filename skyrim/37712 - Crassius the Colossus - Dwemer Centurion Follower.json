  "descriptionHtml": "V2 - fixed a few things so if your one of those who downloaded the first version, redownload the V2 as it fixes the unable to use melee attacks.\r\n\r\nSince I can\\'t seem to find a decent Dwemer Centurion follower (tring out Dwemer Certifified, Automotions etc) basically any mod that adds a Dwemer Robot follower, I found some don\\'t work, others overight one another e.g. the Smithing Dwemer perks and others are just too long and iffy to create even if they are ment to be like that and lore friendly.\r\n\r\nThis guy is a typical Centurion with a slight different... he can Fus Ro Da!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif you did not know this, Centurions, when they use their steam attack, they actually are \\\"Shouting\\\" as you would in a tomb full of nasty draugr... or femme fetalles in skimpy Valkyrie bikini armor with crotchless panties and exposed super-jiggly boobie mods abundant!!! (I don\\'t use that stuff)\r\n\r\nIm sticking with the Dwemer theme so I made this simple mod.\r\n\r\nNo DLCs needed.\r\n\r\nCrassius is a nod from a popular book and he is not just a \\\"Colossus\\\" because of his huge size ya know. xD\r\n\r\nFind him outside Avanchnzel, that ruin which that rather tasty Argonian lady is wandering about. \\\"take the lexicon from me, oh please!\\\" Get Wujeeta alone in the Riften Werehouse with her and uh-huh-huh! xD\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy!",
