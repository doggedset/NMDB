  "descriptionHtml": "These settings were based upon several other great ENB mods that I have downloaded and tweaked to fit my liking.\r\n\r\nTo install, put the contents of the folder into the root folder of the game directory (where TESV.exe is located),\r\ne.g.: \\'C:\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\'\r\n\r\nTo turn on SSAO, go into your \\'skyrimprefs.ini\\' file and change the \\'bFloatPointRenderTarget=0\\' to \\'bFloatPointRenderTarget=1\\'\r\nTo turn off SSAO, go into your \\'skyrimprefs.ini\\' file and change the \\'bFloatPointRenderTarget=1\\' to \\'bFloatPointRenderTarget=0\\'\r\n\r\nBased upon \\'Stakado Realistic ENB 2.3\\' and RayBay\\'s ENB Settings, as well as a mix-n-match of many other ENB/Injector/SSAO/graphical overhaul mods.\r\n\r\nPlease note, the file was added by request after I\\'d been uploading some screenshots using my settings. As such, the files included _should_ be all those necessary for the settings to work. I\\'m not exactly experienced with modding Skyrim, and only got my results through trial-and-error. Due to this, there may be files missing (doubtful), or extra files included that are not required (likely). Install at your own risk :P\r\n\r\nVersion History:\r\nv1.0: Initial Release\r\nv1.01: Optional file with tweaked brightness. Please post in the comments if you prefer these settings and/or how they can be improved, and I\\'ll package up a v1.1 as one file.\r\nv1.02: Updated for better compatibility with newer ENB binaries (tested with v.112 but should work fine with v.113).",
