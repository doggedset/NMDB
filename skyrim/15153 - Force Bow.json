  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE: Per request this weapon can now be disenchanted and the Force Blast enchantment can be learned. Also, per request, it now does 0 damage. All damage is now determined by arrow type.\r\n\r\nThis bow knocks targets, including (grounded) dragons, back with overwhelming force. This weapon has been temporarily moved to the street outside the door to Breezehome in Whiterun due to glitches resulting in the workbench being deleted. Any arrows will work, and there are 100 iron arrows with the bow if you don\\'t have any.\r\n\r\nBE VERY CAREFUL using this weapon. NPC\\'s, even quest essential NPC\\'s, can get launched across Skyrim and become \\'lost\\' even if they survive.\r\n\r\nAlways save before using.\r\n\r\nIf you\\'re interested, the script is available for viewing/editing if you load the esp file in the Creation Kit.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nCheck out my other mods:\r\nBlast Sword: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15151\r\nH.P.
