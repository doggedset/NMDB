Guilds are magicians and engineers. They disliked each other, but without those and without others the city would never fly up. Open skirmishes weren&#39;t, but squabbles happened regularly. Why?

Since not only engineers built the reactor, the city quite quietly landed down to the ground. But hordes of savages and barbarians with their unrestrained magic lived in these lands. They right there attacked the city.
