  "descriptionHtml": "---------------------------------\r\nDescription\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nChoose from the range of ESPs to customise how dual casting works in Skyrim. \r\n\r\nCost: This is the magicka cost multiplier. Take for example Thunderbolt, lets say it takes 10 magicka to cast. When dual casted, it will take 2.8 (default multiplier) times more magicka to cast, which means 28 magicka.\r\n\r\nTime: Preperation time between starting casting and being able to fire the spell. \r\n\r\nEffectiveness: Damage multiplier. For example Thunderbolt, lets say it does 10 damage. When dual casted, it will do 2.2 (default multiplier) times more damage, which is 22 damage.\r\n\r\nThe issue with dual casting is that the magicka cost is too high for the increase in effectiveness. This mod lets you change that. :)\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\nInstall\r\n---------------------------------\r\nGo to: Drive Letter:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\\r\nFor those who don\\'t have bought the game on steam, the SkyrimPrefs.ini file is located in Drive Letter:\\\\Users\\\\[USERNAME]\\\\Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\r\n\r\n1. Drop the chosen ESPs in that folder (I recommend storing the excess ones in their own folder, to stop clutter in the Data folder)\r\n2. Launch the Skyrim Launcher, and click on \\'Data Files\\'\r\n3. Tick the chosen ESPs and click \\'Ok\\'\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\nData Files grayed out?\r\n---------------------------------\r\nGo to: Drive Letter:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Skyrim\\\\SkyrimPrefs.ini\r\n\r\nFor those who don\\'t have bought the game on steam, the SkyrimPrefs.ini file is located in Drive Letter:\\\\Users\\\\<USERNAME>\\\\Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\r\n\r\nAdd these lines, or change them if they already exist so they match the below:\r\n\t[Launcher]\r\n\tbEnableFileSelection=1\r\n\r\nIf that fails:\r\n\tGo to: Drive Letter:\\\\Users\\\\[USERNAME]\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Skyrim\r\n\tMake the Skyrim folder un-read only.\r\n",
