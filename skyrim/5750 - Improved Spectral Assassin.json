  "descriptionHtml": "============UPDATE============\r\n\r\nVersion 2 is out! Here\\'s a list of what\\'s been changed from 1.0\r\n\r\n-He no longer repeats the same things Over and Over! For dialogue pertaining to specific quests you are on, he will only say these once! for example, when going to poison the emperor he will say; \\\"A poison stew, eh? I was always partial to apples, myself.\\\" This will only be said one time, this makes these quotes more unique because the quest is unique. It also removes that annoyance of hearing these quest related quotes if you put off a quest for a long period of time.\r\n\r\nFor the random dialogue that is constantly repeated I had to set the \\\"cooldown\\\" (if you will) for each thing he says to a MUCH higher number. Basically this means that at first he will say random things very quickly. But, as he says one thing it will take MUCH longer for him to repeat that same line. So, after he is done with every thing he says, It will be Much longer before he speaks again. Just use him as usual and once he says everything it will be all ready to go. Let me know how this works for you! \r\n\r\n-You are now able to spawn him more then once per day!\r\n\r\n-He no longer drops a pile of goo when he dies! I\\'ve changed the way he works here significantly. He no longer lasts for 999 days as was set before. I have made him invincible for a time period that you choose. I\\'ve added 3 options for you to choose from. 1 Minute, 5 Minutes, and 10 Minutes. I\\'ll add more options if requested in the comments. \r\n\r\nIf you have Version 1.0 you\\'ll need to uninstall it before you can successfully use 2.0. The first file you\\'ll need to uninstall are ISA or ISA-Silent. The second file is located here.\r\n\r\nmeshes\\\\actors\\\\character\\\\facegendata\\\\facegeom\\\\skyrim.esm\\\\000a0e49\r\n\r\nThis filed was added because version one was done with the Skyrim NPC Editor. So you\\'ll need to uninstall this file or his face will be shaded darker then the rest of his body. Not a HUGE deal because you can\\'t see the rest of his body. But, I would suggest getting rid of it anyways. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think and recommend it to your friends if they\\'re DB fans like I am!\r\n\r\n==============================\r\n\r\nThis is a quick change to the Spectral Assassin. I gave him robes similar to the ones he wore in Oblivion, a Daedric Dagger, and improved his One-Handed Skill to 100. His defense is the same but he can now do much more damage. all in all he is much more effective and worth using. Also added an optional file to make him SILENT! Most people dislike using him because he is so very abnoxious. The Silent version fixes that.",
