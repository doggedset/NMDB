  "descriptionHtml": "One day with the CK. I think there are some good ideas in it so worth playing. Some jump and run things as well.\r\n\r\nThe key in the first room is for this purpose easy to find...\r\n\r\nmaybe someone will find the 3 secret chests ( jump n run is needed )\r\n\r\nLocation near the Skyforge ( near the city wall -> see pic )\r\n\r\nWould be nice if the woman in the fire would scream when you enter the room and as soon as you are in her range she will disappears. Maybe coming soon. \r\n\r\nBesides it\\'s pretty dark to keep an fearfull atmosphere\r\n\r\nHave fun :)\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first mod so please do not blame me for fail lightning e.g :/\r\n\r\nA proper location will come soon as well as lighning fix and content adding. \r\n\r\n!!!!
