  "summary": "An new argonian shop outside Whiterun&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "Description:\r<br />Sells-Many-Things is not allowed to open a shop in Whiterun because he is an Argonian&#33; But that won&#39;t stop him. He bought a patch of land and built his own shop from the ground up. The Argonian Trader is now open for business&#33;\r<br />This is a small mod I made which adds a new shop to Skyrim. It&#39;s just outside of Whiterun, in front of the Honningbrew Meadery (see the map in the pictures). It has been hand-decorated to have an authentic feel, like any other shop in Skyrim. The merchant sells almost everything, including weapons, armor, scrolls, potions, ingredients etc... Please keep in mind I created this mod to test out my CK skills, and it&#39;s my first one.\r<br />\r<br />Bugs/Issues:\r<br />Currently I do not know of any bugs in this mod, but if you come across any, be sure to let me know&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility:\r<br />This mod is only incompatible with any mods that alter the area around Honningbrew Meadery, which means it&#39;s probably compatible with most mods. \r<br />It&#39;s incompatible with Eli&#39;s Shack and Provincial courier service, but I made a patch for that.\r<br />\r<br />Finally, I hope you enjoy this mod and if you have any issues with this at all contact me and I&#39;ll do my best to fix it.",
