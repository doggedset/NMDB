  "descriptionHtml": "Say goodbye to the weak, slow, damn allies. Although it\\'s not that creative, i thought it would be awesome to have better followers without the need for spending many hours making armors and weapons for them.\r\n\r\nIn this mod, I improved the health, speed, stamina, armors, weapons and the levels of the followers. For The Companions, I didn\\'t change the armor for all of them, for some of them, i improved their armor and gave them all better enchanted weapons. \r\n\r\nIf a follower uses a his Steel Shield, use \\\"i need to trade things with you\\\" and take it from him, this happens because i can\\'t remove the default Steel Shield from their inventory. \r\nMake sure to backup your save file first.\r\n\r\nI hope you like it. Please let me know if their are any problems\r\n",
