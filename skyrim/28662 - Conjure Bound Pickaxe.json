  "descriptionHtml": "[[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/articles/51469]There will be no SE port of this mod. Read here for more information[/url]]\n<br />\n<br />Adds a conjuration spell to summon a bound pickaxe and an associated spell tome located in Embershard Mine: [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Embershard_Mine]http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Embershard_Mine[/url]\n<br />\n<br />The book is in a locked room, on a table, next to a spell tome for Clairvoyance. The room is on the right just after crossing the drawbridge.\n<br />\n<br />There is another mod which adds a similar spell, but it seems to crash after adding the Mystic Binding perk. It also conflicts with two other mods I'm running, so I created this for my own use.\n<br />\n<br />The pickaxe will be conjured for five minutes. However, remember that the automatic mining animation forces you to sheathe anything equipped, so that makes the pickaxe spell end. However, you will still mine whatever ore vein you clicked on. Just cast the pickaxe again when you move on to the next vein. If you simply \"attack\" the vein, you can mine it quicker that way and the pickaxe will not disappear, but not every vein can be \"attacked\" for some reason.\n<br />\n<br />Please don't ask if I can make the blue glowy effect like bound weapons. I honestly don't have a clue how to do that.",
