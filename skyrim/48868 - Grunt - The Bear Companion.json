  "descriptionHtml": "[center] [img]http://i.imgur.com/YU0ccD2.png[/img] [/center]\r<br />\r<br />[color=Orange][size=3][b][u]Overview[/u][/b][/size][/color]\r<br />Grunt is a cave bear companion that is as loyal as he is fierce. He will fight by your side and follow you to the ends of Tamriel. \r<br />\r<br />[color=Orange][size=3][b][u]Description[/u][/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />I started a playthrough with a hunter/survivalist sort of character and I knew he had to have a pet bear. I looked for cave bear followers and, while I found a few, some didn&#39;t work, and others weren&#39;t what quite I was looking for. As such, I decided to create my own. Once I saw that he served me well, I decided to share him with others. \r<br />\r<br />This mod is very basic, but effective. He will obey standard follow/stay/dismiss commands, and (though it is slightly unrealistic and borderline immersion-breaking) carry items for you, presumably storing them in hammerspace. \r<br />\r<br />He behaves similar to dog companions like the hunting dog from Markarth, or the Huskies and Death Hounds in Dawnguard. It&#39;s important to note that you can still have a normal NPC follower along w/ him.  If you&#39;re playing on a lower difficulty, this will make the early quests very trivial. Grunt (as with most NPC bears) is pretty powerful.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Youdojo for this amazing spotlight&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]5x4tqQOBTUE[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]3AO7gX8yxBM[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[color=Orange][size=3][u][b]Installation[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r<br />- Pretty simple: Use Nexus Mod Manager, or extract the archive into your data folder. \r<br />\r<br />- Grunt is located just outside Riverwood. If you&#39;re coming from Helgen, he&#39;s relaxing up in the grass to the right of the road, right before you enter the town. \r<br />\r<br />[color=Orange][size=3][u][b]Size Issues[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r<br />Some folks have requested a smaller version. Rather than making a version with a smaller static size, I decided to include instructions on how to edit this yourself, since your preference may differ: \r<br />\r<br />If you find that he is too large, you can make him a bit smaller by doing the following:\r<br />\r<br />1. Press ~ to bring up the console\r<br />\r<br />2. Click on Grunt. You should see his item code in the center of the console.\r<br />\r<br />3. Type &#34;setscale x.x&#34; (without the quotation marks)\r<br />\r<br /> x.x = the size you want. 1.0 is the normal size, and anything between 0.1 and 0.9 will make him that much smaller. \r<br /> \r<br />[color=Orange][size=3][u][b]Compatibility[/b][/u][/size][/color]\r<br />I&#39;ve not noticed too many compatibility issues with the mods that I use, but I do not use AFT or UFO regularly, so I can&#39;t say for sure how he will react with those or other popular follower related mods.  \r<br />\r<br />----\r<br />\r<br />PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let me know if there are any issues. This is my first mod and I&#39;m bound to have screwed something up somewhere, so I certainly appreciate any input.\r<br />\r<br />For those who prefer the Steam workshop way of doing things: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=204506171\r<br />\r<br />Stay tuned for my next mod: &#34;Library of the Thane&#34; \r<br />\r<br />----\r<br />\r<br />[color=Orange]Version v1.1[/color]\r<br />-Made Grunt level with character instead of being static lvl 16.",
