  "descriptionHtml": "A simple mod that allows 10 followers to be recruited by the Blades. \r\n\r\nTested and working with the latest game updates! ;)\r\n\r\nRelease date: Mar.29.2012\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>>> NOTES <<<\r\n\r\n\r\n* This mod was made from scratch and it is not compatible with other Blades\\' mods avaible here.\r\n* This is only a gameplay/quest mod and won\\'t mess up with Skyhaven Temple. If you\\'d like to have an improved Temple, try out [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11750]this mod[/url] instead (by ItsMeToo).\r\n* This works great even if you already recruited the three standard Blades (as long as you didn\\'t start Esbern\\'s dragon hunting quest).\r\n* During the dragon hunting quests, only the first three Blades recruited will fight along with you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>>> Please endorse this file if you find it useful - support the community. <<<",
