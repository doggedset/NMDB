  "modName": "Conjure Creatures- In a Lore Friendly way",
  "summary": "Allows you to conjure dragon priests and gargoyles to fight for you. Completely lore friendly, possibly makes the lore more convincing, too.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b][size=5]Introduction[/size][/b]\n<br />[size=3]Isn't it sad that you can only summon a dragon priest when you wear Konahrik. Worse still, the dragon priest [b]only have 15% chance[/b] to appear [b]when your health is below 15% health[/b]. Who doesn't want to summon a dragon priest to fight for them? Or you are upset being only able to conjure up a gargoyle when in Vampire Lord form? Not fond of vampirism?\n<br />\n<br />I do. That is where this mod comes in.\n<br />\n<br />Other mods do almost the same this mod does, the only difference is that this mod does not [i]simply add the spell tome to Dragonsreach[/i] or [i]allow you to craft it at a forge for nothing[/i]. Instead you have to progress through the Dawnguard quest line to obtain this powerful spell.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]How to obtain the spell tome?\n<br />[/size][/b][size=5][size=3][b]Conjure Dragon Priest:[/b]\n<br />After you have defeated the 3 keepers, go back to Valerica. She will then bring you into the Boneyard, where you will face Durnehviir. Then leads you to get the Elder Scroll, the spell tome is right on the table next to the case holding the Elder Scroll.\n<br />[b]Conjure Gargoyle:[/b]\n<br />Right besides Lord Harkon's Throne in Volkihar Castle.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Is there a staff enchantment?[/size][/b]\n<br />Yes! After you have learnt the spell, you may head to Tel Mithryn. In the Staff Enchanter menu, you may create the [b]Staff of Dragon Priest[/b] or [b]Staff of Gargoyle[/b]. The cost of crafting the staff is high as the spell itself is powerful.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Why is this lore friendly?[/size][/b]\n<br />[/size][/size][size=3]Ever wondered why Valerica kept the Keepers at bay? [i]Conjure Dragon Priest[/i] is why.\n<br />\n<br />What of [i]Conjure Gargoyle[/i] ? Pure-blood Vampires know how to summon them to their aid, that obviously should not be only available in Vampire Lord form.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Will there be a Thrall version?\n<br />[/size][/b][size=5][size=3]No. At least not at the moment. I am still a novice to using the Creation Kit and don't know how to mess with Papyrus scripts and leveled lists, I failed to add the thrall spell to spell vendors. The thrall spell will make the game a lot easier as well. So I don't plan to add a thrall spell.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Requirements:[/b]\n<br />[/size][/size][/size]Dawnguard DLC(all versions)\n<br />Dragonborn DLC(v2 and v3 only)[/size]",
