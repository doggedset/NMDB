  "descriptionHtml": "Fhelalr&#39;s Skyrim Screenshot Collection (FSSC) Screensaver: Dragonborn Comes Edition contains 47 high quality screenshots. All screenshots are in resolution of 1920*1080. It has 2 themes, one is with a black overlay on top of each screenshot, the other is without an overlay.\r<br />\r<br />The main purpose of adding a black overlay was to benefit users with monitor sizes bigger than 1920*1080. A black overlay covers up the border of each screenshot, so it looks like the images blend into the black background if you use it on a monitor larger than 1920*1080. \r<br />\r<br />If your monitor size is exactly 1920*1080, it is better to just use the one without an overlay. \r<br />\r<br />The background music called The Dragonborn Comes is produced by the talented and wonderful Malukah, you can also download it for free from her official website. \r<br />\r<br />Each screenshot&#39;s display time and the speed of transition effect has been adapted to the rhyme of the song. The song and all the screenshots will be in a loop. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------------------NOTE-------------------------------------------------\r<br />&#34;Beauty of Dawn&#34; edition containing 50 screenshots and background music will be uploaded soon. \r<br />Also, a special edition containing 100 screenshots without background music will also be released soon.
