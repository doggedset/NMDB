  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][color=red][b]The Mushroom Hut - A Tel Mithryn Player Home [/b][/color][/heading] \r<br />\r<br />After running around and doing everything I could for one of my favourite NPCs ever, Neloth, I was a little disappointed that I didn&#39;t even get my own room at Tel Mithryn. I mean, really? I killed Miraak for you guys&#33; (Well, Mora did anyway) Anyway, I finally gave in and made a small, lore-friendly hut for the area&#33; Obviously, it requires the Dragonborn DLC. \r<br />\r<br />Please note there are TWO versions, one with a key and one without. If you want the hose without the hassle of finding the key, take the optional file. For a more immersive way of gaining it, the key will be in Tel Mithryn, in a room which is only unlocked by completing some quests.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][b]~NOW FEATURING MOD RESOURCES~[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />It features:\r<br />* A few crafting stations - Alchemy, enchanting, cooking and some smithing supplies outside\r<br />* Ash Yarn Garden\r<br />* A couple of storage options\r<br />* A bed with a well-rested bonus\r<br />* As well as a lovely note from Neloth himself&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Perfect for roleplayers, mages and alchemists. This was pretty fun to make and gave me some good experience with modding so I hope you all like it&#33; Also check out the video below to get a better look at the place.\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]oPJMdU8Niwc[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]=====[b]Permissions and Credits[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Just drop the file into your data folder. Or use the NMM. To uninstall, just remove the file. Make sure to get your belongings out first though&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]=====[b]Permissions and Credits[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />This mod is not to be uploaded anywhere but the Skyrim Nexus. Please report to me if you see this anywhere else.\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating a great game and letting us fiddle with it. \r<br />Credit to Oarisstys for the use of the Mod Resources Pack.\r<br />Credit to Blary for the use of the Moth in Cage Resource, Food Container Resource and Wall Art Resource.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Thanks for reading and check my page for more mods&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/7065334/?tb=mods&pUp=1 ] [IMG]http://i42.tinypic.com/2dryws3.png[/IMG][/url]",
