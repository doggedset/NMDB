  "summary": "Small compatibility patch for Jojjo\\'s Dread Knight Weapon Set and T3nd0\\'s Skyrim Redone, version 0.99.20",
  "descriptionHtml": "Dread Knight Weapon Set: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15494\r\nSkyrim Redone: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286\r\n\r\nVersion 0.99.20 of Skyrim Redone implemented a unique way of calculating armor/damage values for armor and weapons, based on the armor piece or weapon type, and the material it\\'s composed from. Because of this, many weapon mods that were previously compatible found themselves no longer being supported by the newest version of Skyrim Redone. This patch seeks to fix that issue.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n1. Install \\\"SkyRe  - Jojjo\\'s Dreadknight Patch.esp\\\" into your DATA folder\r\n2. Load after \\\"SkyRe_Main.esp\\\"\r\n3. DISABLE \\\"Dread Knight Weapon Set.esp\\\"\r\n\r\nYou must have Jojjo\\'s Dread Knight Weapon Set installed already in order for this to work. Please report any errors in the patch to me via a private message and I will see what I can do to fix them.",
