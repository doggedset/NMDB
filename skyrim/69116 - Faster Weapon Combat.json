  "descriptionHtml": "So i was bored and google some mods that mod skyrims tedious combat faster and i found this little mod that makes weapon swing faster but that was like last updated 20 years ago so its dead, so i made this based off it.\r<br />\r<br />This mod modifies every weapon that you can get your hands on to swing a little bit faster than the way it does in the normally like maces are so damn slow, that i just wanted to cry every time i try to use one but this will semi fix that.. This only edits weapons so it has no scripts or anything like that so it should be safe to uninstall, backup your saves before trying this out\r<br />\r<br />Some weapons will remain unchanged if you have a mod that touches these weapons but if you rather have a unique looking weapon instead of a faster one thats fine, just have it after this mod so its records overwrite this one.\r<br />\r<br />TL;DR this mod changes weapons speed stats so it swings hella faster, instead of being all slow and tedious and shit\r<br />\r<br />Requires no other mods to work other than the dlcs\r<br />\r<br />I have pictures, thats all i got, no vids. Im not experienced at recording things\r<br />\r<br />Original mod -Â Faster Combat by monkeybladea\r<br />\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12539/?",
