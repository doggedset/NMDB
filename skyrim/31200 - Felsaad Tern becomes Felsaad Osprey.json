  "descriptionHtml": "Dragonborn adds a new hawk to the game, but named as a seabird instead of as a raptor. This mod simply renames the bird to better fit its location, altitude, shape and behavior. Its feathers (a new ingredient) are also renamed.\r\n\r\nWhen I heard there were terns in Dragonborn, I excitedly circumambulated almost the whole island, looking and listening for the perky, noisy little fishing birds. I didn\\'t find any, until I looked up at a hawk. They didn\\'t...? They did. Now undone, if you wish.\r\n\r\nThere are a few mods that touch ingredient names. This simple tweak may well conflict with a Dragonborn edition of such a mod, so use your judgment when placing this one in your list.",
