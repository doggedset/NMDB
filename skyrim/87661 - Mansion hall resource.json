  "descriptionHtml": "[b]INTRO\r<br />\r<br />I downloaded many player house mods, and I like them all, but I came across the problem that noone of them fits my need compleetly. Some of them are too big, some are too small, lots of them have stuff I don&#39;t really like and missing the stuff I need. And since most of the modders don&#39;t allow to modify their mods, I decided to make my own one. That&#39;s why I started this project.\r<br />\r<br />The idea was to make the classic Lovecraftian/Amnesia style mansion with magic laboratory, huge library, hidden doors and rooms,Â  basemet with altars, daedric shrines [/b]and other &#34;dark&#34; stuff. \r<br />And then I came across an other problem: I spent a lot of time for only one hall, retexturing and positioning parts (not even started placing scripted elements). And even bigger problem - I don&#39;t know how exactly this house should look - where&#39;s gonna be bedroom or library, how big it should be and a stuff like that.\r<br /> I&#39;m not sure if I will finish this poject so I decided to upload what is already done for someone more skillfull could use it.\r<br />\r<br />DESCRIPTION\r<br />\r<br />This is basicly a pack of retextured meshes - walls, floors, columns, stairs and a hidden panel-door. All meshes are vanilla, woden pannel texture is taken somewhere from the internet (dont remember when and where exactly)\r<br />\r<br />PERMISSIONS\r<br />\r<br />You can use the full room or any part of it your creation IF:\r<br />1. You credit me and give a link to this page.\r<br />2. You notify me. Just give me the link to your mod when it&#39;s uploaded, no asking is needed:). Maybe it will give me the idea of where to move.\r<br />3. You allow me to use any part of your mod that has my elements (with the credit off cource). Sounds fair to me.\r<br />4. NO COMMERCIAL USE&#33; (because F*** the commerce&#33;).\r<br />\r<br />I think I&#39;m not asking for much, so.. take it and have fun:)\r<br />\r<br />p.s. Sorry my English, I&#39;m not the native speaker.\r<br />______________________________________\r<br />\r<br />If someone can help with the trianglle floor parts in library - I will be very thankful&#33; Seems like they&#39;re bigger then they look and character&#39;s just walking around on the air.",
