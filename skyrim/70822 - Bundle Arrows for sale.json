  "modName": "Bundle Arrows for sale",
  "summary": "Allows you to bundle together 24 arrows together so they actually sell for less than a gold each.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod allows you to bundle together 24 Iron, Falmer, Forsworn or Ancient Nord arrows together to sell for 6, 8, 8 or 10 gold(base value) respectively. Since these don&#39;t normally sell for anything(since Skyrim doesn&#39;t have support for selling things for less than a gold) this allows you to actually make money off of usually worthless items.\r<br />\r<br />You craft the arrows together at the tanning rack and it shouldn&#39;t give you any smiting experience, beware you can still shoot them for 1 damage so don&#39;t use this to transport arrows only use it to sell them. You can also uncraft the bundle from a tanning rack. It should be compatible with anything and everything, balanced and run like a brick.\r<br />\r<br />If you think that they sell for too little or anything just tell me, its easy to change the values.",
