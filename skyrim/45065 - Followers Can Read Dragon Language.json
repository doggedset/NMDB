  "descriptionHtml": "This mod allows your followers to translate word walls for you. But before they will be able to do it you have to find the book titled &#34;Dragon language: Myth no more&#34; and give it to your follower (to add the book to your inventory use console command &#34;player.additem EF2C0 1&#34;). The next time you are near a word wall just ask them about &#34;carvings on the wall&#34;. You can also ask your follower to read carvings on the stone tablet that you find in Bleak Falls Barrow. If you already completed Bleak Falls Barrow quest and gave the tablet to Farengar you will find it on his desk next time you enter Dragonsreach. \r<br />\r<br />The mod does not use scripts and is compatible with anything that does not not touch word walls. \r<br />\r<br />Not required but recommended: SKSE plugin [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14884]Fuz Ro D-oh - Silent Voice[/url]. With it subtitles for unvoiced dialogue will be displayed whether or not you have disabled subtitles in the display settings.\r<br />\r<br />Also see [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51690]Dragonborn Can Read Dragon Language[/url]",
