Introduction[/center][/size][/u]\r\nThe goal of this mod is to make all NPCs marriable/follower and to simplify the way to do it. There already exists plenty of ways to make xxxx marriable/a follower but these are complicated because you have to use several command in the console. With my mod you just have to write something in the console and you can get married and have plenty of children :D or you can make smbd a follower.\r\n\r\n[b]BE CAREFUL : Some very special NPCs won\\'t be marriable and won\\'t follow you  even with my mod. I don\\'t know why but Maven Roncenoir is not available... (maybe it will work in your save. Does it depend on thieves\\' guild quest?) and maybe others. However Jarls are available. But you must know that it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to marry a character not \\'\\'normally\\'\\' available ONLY if you have finished all the quest(s) related to him/her. If you don\\'t, crashes, CDTs, bugs, or SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION may appear (lol).[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][size=4][center]II. Requirements[/center][/size][/u]\r\n[center]You must use [url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]SKE Script extender[/url].\r\nIt is important to use 1.6.89 version of Skyrim or a higher one. \r\nYou have to install it manually because you don\\'t have to put it in the DATA folder. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][size=4]III.  Installation[/size][/u]\r\n\r\nFirst, to avoid any problem, make a backup of your saves and skyrim\\'s main files. (Just to be sure^^)\r\n\r\n[u]Manual installation[/u]\r\nFirst, if you were brave enough, you already read all the stuff above and you know that NMM installation is not available!\r\n\r\nWell you will have to download the zip file.\r\nThen extract it into you skyrim\\'s main FOLDER!!! Not in the DATA folder! \r\nAnd..... You\\'re Done :D\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][size=4]IV.  Compatibility[/center][/size][/u]\r\n[center]I Use more than 30 mods, and I didn\\'t encounter any problems. Anyway, I don\\'t see why a conflict would appear because I do not modify any meshes/file......[/center]\r\n\r\nN.B : If you encounter any problem, please, send me a PM and I will try to answer as quick as possible!\r\n\r\n[u][size=4][center]V.  How to use it[/center][/size][/u]\r\n[center]You will have to follow some steps and everything will be fine! Just remember that you must be careful with it. Don\\'t chose a random NPCs before checking that he/she is related to a quests that you did not already completed! Moreover my mod works with already married NPCs but I suppose some strange things may appear. Feedbacks are welcome :D[/center]\r\n\r\nMarriage:\r\n[u]STEP 1 : [/u] Talk to maramal and buy an amulet of Mara. My mod will give you an other one so the amulet is not important but this is important to start properly.\r\n[u]STEP 2 : [/u] Choose a NPC [u]PROPERLY[/u].\r\n[u]STEP 3 : [/u] Open the console (²) in front of the NPC you wanna marry, then click onto him/her (the ID of the character should appear) and write without closing the console \\'\\'bat Wedding\\'\\' (without the \\').\r\n[u]STEP 4: [/u] Then put your amulet of mara on and talk to him/her. You should see \\\"interested in me?\\\" and you\\'re done![/u]\r\n\r\nFollower:\r\n[u]STEP 1 : [/u] Choose a NPC [u]PROPERLY[/u]\r\n[u]STEP 3 : [/u] Open the console (²) in front of the NPC you wanna marry, then click onto him/her (the ID of the character should appear) and write without closing the console \\'\\'bat Follower\\'\\' (without the \\')[/u]\r\n[u]STEP 4: [/u]Then talk to him/her and say \\\"I need your help!\\\"[/u]\r\n\r\nDivorce :\r\n[u]STEP 1 : [/u] Kill your spouse [u]PROPERLY[/u] (lol)\r\n[u]STEP 3 : [/u] Open the console (²) in front of the corpse (mouhaha), then click onto it (the ID of the character should appear) and write without closing the console \\'\\'bat Divorce\\'\\' (without the \\')[/u]\r\n[u]STEP 4: [/u]Then the quest of the marriage should reset completely. You can now talk to maramal and ask him for an other amulet of mara ;)!\\\"[/u]\r\n\r\n[u][center]Releases :[/center][/u]\r\n23rd February 2013 : Divorce file released.\r\n16th January 2013 : First released.",
