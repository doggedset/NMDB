  "descriptionHtml": "I\\'ve always had a hard time spotting Giant Lichen plants in those salt marshes. So I made a couple adjustments to the texture to make it easier to spot, while still appearing in place in the marshes. It still looks all fungus-y and whatnot, but it\\'s a more saturated purple and stands out a touch more.\r\n\r\nInstalling:\r\nJust drop/merge the textures folder in your Skyrim data folder. It\\'s that easy. It should work with the NMM too. If not, let me know, I\\'ll sort that out.\r\n\r\nThis should just change the texture of the one plant/ingredient.\r\n\r\nAlso. I\\'m willing to try my hand at any requests. I\\'m pretty new to this modding thing still, but there\\'s only one way to improve after all...\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nBethesda for such a great game and for making it so easy for me to mutilate their work.",
