  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u]Description:[/u][/b]\r<br />Ever wish Chillrend was a Greatsword, or a Bow, or a Dagger, or any of the other weapon types?  Well, now you can have them all&#33;  Full set of Glass weapons with Chillrend&#39;s enchantment and retextured to match.\r<br />\r<br />Weapons: Arrows, Battleaxe, Bow, Dagger, Greatsword, Mace, War Axe, Warhammer\r<br />--all have tempering recipes, and can be improved just like the original Chillrend if you have a Refined Malachite and the Arcane Blacksmithing perk\r<br />--Chillrend Arrows are craftable at the forge under the Glass category using 1 Refined Malachite, 1 Firewood, and 1 Frost Salts\r<br />--all weapons (minus the arrows, of course) carry the maximum strength Chillrend enchantment\r<br />\r<br />To acquire these weapons, head to Castle Dour.  When Mercer Frey stole the original Chillrend from the Castle Dour armoury, he didn&#39;t know that there was a frost-covered chest sitting neglected underneath a table in the Castle Dour Dungeons.  Find it, and steal the rest of the Chillrend weapons for yourself.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Notes:[/u][/b]\r<br />I&#39;ve seen a number of requests for a complete Chillrend armoury, and being a lover of Chillrend myself, I thought &#34;hey, I could do that.&#34;  So here we are.  I think 99% of us can honestly say that we absolutely hate leveled reward versions of weapons that carry weaker enchantments, which is why I&#39;ve only included one version that has max-level enchantments.  If you&#39;re worried that&#39;s a bit of a cheat. . . well, I&#39;m giving you an easily accessible chest full of powerful weapons.  It&#39;s already a cheat.\r<br />\r<br />I have not touched anything regarding the original Chillrend.  The weapons do use the vanilla enchantment, so if you have a mod that modifies the Chillrend enchantment, it will also affect these weapons.\r<br />\r<br />The unique dry ice effect for Chillrend was made specifically to fit the Glass Sword model.  As a result, the waves of icy air will emanate from thin air on the shorter weapons (it&#39;s only really noticeable on the dagger).  I think it looks fine (the air is still coming from the general area of the weapons), and it&#39;s not really something I can fix, but I thought I would mention it.\r<br />\r<br />The mod has been cleaned in TES5Edit to ensure maximum cleanliness.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Requirements:[/u][/b]\r<br />Latest update and Dawnguard\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Update 1.1[/u][/b]\r<br />--upped base damage of all weapons to bring them in line with vanilla Chillrend&#39;s higher damage compared to regular Glass\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Installation:[/u][/b]\r<br />--use NMM, or extract the ChillrendWeapons.esp and meshes and textures folders to your Skyrim Data folder\r<br />[b][u]Uninstallation:[/u][/b]\r<br />--use NMM, or delete ChillrendWeapons.esp and the meshes and textures folders named chillrendweapons.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Credits/Programs Used:[/u][/b]\r<br />--[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/247/?]BSAopt[/url]\r<br />--[url=http://www.gimp.org/]Gimp[/url]\r<br />--[url=http://niftools.sourceforge.net/wiki/NifSkope]NifScope[/url]\r<br />--[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/740/?]Skyrim Retexturing Software Tutorial by David Brasher[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Permissions:[/u][/b]\r<br />If you want to incorporate my mod or its resources in a mod of your own, you may do so provided that you credit me for anything you use.
