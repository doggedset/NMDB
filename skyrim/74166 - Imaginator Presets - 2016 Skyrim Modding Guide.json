  "descriptionHtml": "This group of presets for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13049/?]The Imaginator[/url] , by MyGoodEye and Gopher, and were created for my personal use. They are shown in my modding tutorial series, &#34;2016 Skyrim Modding Guide, Episode 17&#34;, and I decided to share them here for anyone interested in using them.\r<br />\r<br />[font=monospace][youtube]-Gqo43gEIJw[/youtube][/font]\r<br />\r<br />The intention was to create a more vivid, yet realistic, color scheme by mixing Imaginator&#39;s main presets, then increasing the saturation to offset Climates of Tamriel&#39;s flat color palette. By increasing the &#34;Contrast&#34; and decreasing the &#34;Sky&#34; settings, I wanted to recreate the feel of ambient light of being at altitude in a more northern latitude. The skies are a deeper blue during the day, yet darker at night. Daytime light is harsher, and the added benefit is that the increased contrast deepened the shadows, and highlighted details.\r<br />\r<br />The file includes sample screenshots, images of the Imaginator MCM, and Text File for all values.The images shown do not use any ENB, but are affected by the following installed mods:\r<br />Climates of Tamriel v5\r<br />Dynavision\r<br />Enhanced Lighting for ENB\r<br />Relighting Skyrim\r<br />Claralux 2015\r<br />\r<br />The 2016 Skyrim Modding Guide by Dirty Weasel Media is available on Youtube at this [url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWMvEg2LxwXa1uMmZMmIl4mheoDRwvOY1]Playlist[/url]",
