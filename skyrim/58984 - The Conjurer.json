  "descriptionHtml": "Back in Oblivion, there was a bit of paid DLC called &#39;Spell Tomes&#39;. This DLC added a number of extra magical spells to the game, but it also added another thing. One NPC, a conjurer, would spawn and hunt you down, no matter where you were. At the bottom of an enormous dungeon, the middle of a crowded city, locked up in a high-security stronghold... He would find you, and if you were unprepared, he would murder you. Terrifying.\r<br />\r<br />Now, i have brought that same character back, except... I&#39;ve done what I could to distill that feeling of terror i got when he finally found me. This guy is brutally strong, and has no reason to wait for you to prepare yourself before he sets a dremora lord on you.\r<br />\r<br />For best effect, activate this mod once your character has levelled up a bit and gotten some decent gear.\r<br />\r<br />Oh, and he respawns. I feel like I should warn you about that.\r<br />You can run, but you can&#39;t hide.\r<br />\r<br />Hircine would be proud.",
