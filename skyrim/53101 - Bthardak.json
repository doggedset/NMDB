  "descriptionHtml": "[b][size=200]Bthardak 1.0[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Description:[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Bthardak is a medium-sized, Dwemer-themed player house located west of Riverwood, and northwest of Anise&#39;s Cabin.  The house contains three areas: an atrium, the living quarters, and the forge/armory.  There is a quick access elevator directly to the living quarters, however, the first time you enter the house you have to go through the atrium.  The quick access elevator key is located on the desk in the master bedroom (it looks like a lexicon).\r<br />\r<br />The house contains named/custom storage containers for various different types of items in addition to standard containers.  It also has an in-house blacksmith that wanders between the living quarters and the forge/armory and a housecarl follower.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][b][size=4]NOTE: This mod requires the Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn DLCs to function.[/size][/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />This is the first mod I made that I have uploaded to the Nexus.
