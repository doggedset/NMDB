  "descriptionHtml": "This is Wallpaper, not a mod!\r\n\r\nI uploaded a completely different cycle along with addons here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3228\r\n\r\nYou can add this to them, mix them or replace, it\\'s up to you!\r\n\r\nThis is a series of Skyrim screenshots showing various day night cycles. There is a video of the full cycle including the earlier uploads we made on youtube here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmgGeAHblKU\r\n\r\nAll the shots have been taken at 2560x1600. They will work perfectly on any 16:10 resolution above or below this. If you have a 16:9 monitor and use \\\"Stretch\\\" the vertical aspect will squash a little but should still look ok.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you may notice that cycles vary in length. This is because I\\'ve removed shots which basically look the same. In this version I was more ruthless with the editing to make a larger difference from shot to shot.\r\n\r\nTo install:\r\n\r\nChoose the version with the Skyrim logo or the version without and download.\r\n\r\nSkyrim Time Lapse Wallpaper Help:\r\n\r\nHow to set it as your background!\r\n\r\nInstructions are for Windows 7 users only, sorry if your using Windows Vista or Xp\r\nyou will have to do it yourselves!I have assumed you know how to use winrar and be able\r\nto extract files.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 1: Make a new folder on your desktop or in another suitable location and extract the contents\r\nof Skyrim_Wallpaper_Day_Night_Cycle.rar into it.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Right click on your desktop and goto personalize.\r\n\r\nStep 3: At the bottom left hand corner of the personalise window there should be \\\"Desktop Background\\\",\r\nclick it.\r\n\r\nStep 4: At the top of the next window it should say \\\"Picture Location\\\" click the browse button to the\r\nright of this and find the folder where you stored the screenshots.\r\n\r\nStep 5: At the top right hand corner should be \\\"Select All\\\" and \\\"Clear All\\\"\r\nclick the \\\"Select All\\\" button.\r\n\r\nStep 6: Now all the files should be ticked, at the bottom left hand corner there should be a box and\r\nabove that box it should say \\\"Picture Position\\\", in the box should be something like \\\"Fill\\\", \\\"Center\\\" etc.\r\nclick the box and change it to \\\"Stretch\\\". Depending on your desktop resolution you might want to play with\r\nthe different settings.\r\n\r\nStep 7: To the right of the \\\"Stretch\\\" selection box there should be another selection box saying above it\r\n\\\"Change Picture Every:\\\" The bar will probably have \\\"30 Minutes\\\" in it change that to how long you want\r\nthe background to be the same. I would recommend 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nStep 8: At the bottom right hand corner should be \\\"Save Changes\\\" click that, your background should now\r\nhave changed!!\r\n\r\nNote you might want to deselect or delete the file \\\"intro.jpg\\\" which we used for the youtube vid.\r\n\r\nNote that this will probably not work for Windows Basic and Windows Starter users. I haven\\'t tested this myself but reported by DragonbornP in the comments section.\r\n\r\nYou may want to see a preview of the screenshots on youtube here, as mentioned above this is for all of the shots including all the addons to my previous upload:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmgGeAHblKU\r\n\r\nOblivionRR\\'s channel is here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/OblivionRR\r\n\r\nMODS USED:\r\n\r\nMore or less as before although I have updated the water effects to the latest one (RWT) with a tweaked ocean texture.\r\n\r\nSkyrim Sunglare V3 (Essential)\r\nRealistic Smoke and Embers (Essential)\r\nBetter Landscape Textures\r\nSkyrim HD\r\nImproved Rock And Mountain Textures\r\nHigh Resolution Snow 2048\r\nEnhanced Terrain Noise - 01\r\nVurts Flora stuff minus reachtreebranch01.dds\r\nEnhanced Blood\r\nReal Water Textures (slightly modded)\r\nQD Inventory\r\nYosolda Outfit\r\nRetextured Wolves\r\nCeramic potions & Poisons\r\nAEterna Circlets\r\nEnhanced Night Color Galaxy\r\nEnhanced Night High Stars\r\nDetailed Bodies\r\nDetailed Faces\r\nHigh Quality Eyes\r\nNo More Blocky Faces\r\nTree_LODS_with_shadows\r\nBetter Woodn Interior\r\n\r\nFOV 82 to 95\r\n\r\nMany changes to the .ini files this one gives better LOD at distance:\r\n\r\nuGridsToLoad=7\r\nuExterior Cell Buffer=64\r\niPreloadSizeLimit=262144000 ",
