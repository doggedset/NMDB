  "descriptionHtml": "Being the semi-honest person that I am, when someone tells me that I can&#39;t just go in somewhere and disturb someone&#39;s meeting, I usually say &#34;okay&#34; and walk away.  So I found it a bit unsettling that I had to break into the inner sanctum of the Temple of Dibella to start the Heart of Dibella quest.  Since I definitely wasn&#39;t going to help Degaine steal a statue, and Senna basically said &#34;no entry,&#34; I decided to add a little &#34;divine intervention.&#34;\r<br />\r<br />So Senna forbids you to enter the inner sanctum, but allows you to use the Shrine of Dibella.  So I made the shrine give you a little incentive to go in anyway.  When you use the shrine, you&#39;ll get a notice saying that you&#39;re compelled to enter the sanctum.  Once you do and agree to do the quest, the shrine will stop &#34;compelling&#34; you to enter.\r<br />\r<br />Unfortunately, I can&#39;t do much more than that.  With a little help, I&#39;d like to add a little extra incentive like the shrine casting a spell that cuts your stamina in half or something until you agree to do the quest.  Until then, this is the best I can do.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy.",
