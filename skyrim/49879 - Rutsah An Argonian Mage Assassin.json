You specialise in Lightning Magic, should be mentioned that the game has a bug and you&#39;re allowed to wear as many amulets and rings as you want. Search the houses I&#39;ve already bought and you might find all sorts of treasures hidden inside&#33; Many of the quests have already been completed, what&#39;s left for you is to finish some jobs.\r<br />\r<br />Dragonborn, Dawnguard and Hearthfire DLCes are advised, otherwise you&#39;re gonna lose much of the content I have unlocked.",
