  "summary": "Improves the Rueful Axe\\'s speed among other things making it actually useful as a weapon.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I was really disappointed in weeks before the Creation Kit release I searched the nexus and other sites hoping to find a mod that fixed the Rueful Axe\\'s speed and actually made it worth using as a weapon. Now that the CK is here I wanted to make this tiny mod not only for myself but for anyone else who wants it! This mod changes the Rueful Axe in the following ways,\r\n\r\n1: Puts it\\'s speed on par with the rest of the battle axes.\r\n\r\n2: Boosts the damage to put it on par with a daedric battle axe.\r\n\r\n3: Removes the damage stamina enchantment.\r\n\r\n4: Makes the axe enchantable so you can enchant it however you want.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
