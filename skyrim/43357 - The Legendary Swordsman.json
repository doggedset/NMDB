  "descriptionHtml": "This is the first mod I am uploading to the nexus.\r\n\r\n[heading]Description:[/heading]\r\nA long time ago, a swordsman existed with an immensely powerful sword. This sword was said to have an enchantment so immensely powerful that enemies not expecting an attack received twice the normal damage. However, over 1 century ago, the Legendary Swordsman disappeared, and his fabled sword was lost.\r\n\r\n[heading]Starting the quest:[/heading]\r\nTo start the quest, head to The Arcaneum in Winterhold College. If you look hard enough, you might just find a book titled \\\"The Legendary Swordsman\\\". Reading the book will start the small quest to get the uniquely enchanted sword.\r\n\r\n[heading]What it does:[/heading]\r\nThe mod adds a sword with a custom enchant that gives the player double sneak damage.The sword is disenchantable so the enchant can be placed on other weapons. It adds a small dungeon with 3 leveled Draugr, one of which has the sword. The entrance to the dungeon is located in\r\nWinterhold, and requires a key obtained from the book to open.\r\n\r\n[heading]Updates:[/heading]\r\n[b]Version 1.0:[/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Initial release\r\n[/list]",
