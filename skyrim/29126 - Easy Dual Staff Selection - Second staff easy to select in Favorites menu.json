  "modName": "Easy Dual Staff Selection - Second staff easy to select in Favorites menu",
  "summary": "This mod is a way to fix the selection and hotkey issues in the Favorites menu when you want to equip two of the same types of staff. You can take the second staff to a forge and swap it for a copy of the staff that has a different name - having a different name for the same type of staff eliminates the Favorites/hotkey selection issue.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Please note: There will be no future updates. I have discontinued my support for this mod. It still works fine with all vanilla staves. \r<br />\r<br />But if there&#39;s a bug or issue you would like to fix, or if you just want to improve it, feel free to edit the mod using the Creation Kit. Also in the discussion you are allowed to advertise mods based on the file, or better mods than these.\r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />\r<br />[b]ABOUT[/b]\r<br />One of the issues with Skyrim is that if you have two items with the same name, then it will often mess up when trying to select them in the Favorites menu and with hotkeys. \r<br />\r<br />This mod fixes the problem with having two staves of the same type by giving you the option of swapping one of them for a differently named staff at a forge.\r<br />\r<br />[b]HOW TO USE[/b]\r<br />When you have a staff in your inventory the option to swap the staff becomes available in the Misc section of the crafting forge menu.\r<br />\r<br />FYI: Staves is the plural of staff, not staffs (but I don&#39;t really care, call them staffs is you want).",
