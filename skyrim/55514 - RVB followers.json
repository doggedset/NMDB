To spawn them in you have to search them as I couldn&#39;t set a location for them properly, and sadly at this time do not have custom voices. But on the up note, I am back and working on this mod and will upload pics and have a better description and what not. Also I still don&#39;t know whether or not this mod is actually worth my time considering I can barely run the creation kit :/",
