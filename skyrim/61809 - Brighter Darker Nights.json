  "descriptionHtml": "Here&#39;s my first mod : Brighter Darker Nights.\r<br />This mod basically make the night darker (but not too much) without using enb.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b][center]What this mod do ?[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[/b]tl,dr:[/u][size=2]This mod make the night much darker than in vanilla, but less darker than in the original mod.[/size][u][b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/u][/size]I really enjoyed [size=2][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11356/?]Mike Foxs Darker Nights[/url][/size], I sincerely thank Mike Fox and Daos85 for creating and uploading this great mod.\r<br />I actually just offer you a modified version of his mod, all credits go to him.\r<br />\r<br />However, some user (and me) wished a brighter version. Since this mod is no longuer updated i changed a bunch of the modified RGB value of the original mod (roughly, in vanilla skyrim the night luminosity is 20, Mike fox put this one to 1 and I changed it to 5). The luminosity should be something like 40%-45% brigher than &#34;Darker Nights Bl0&#34;\r<br />\r<br />As a result the night are much darker than in vanilla skyrim But you will be able to see a very little even without any source of light.\r<br />      \r<br />I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s 100%realistic but at least i tried ;)\r<br />And i also made it in order to be able to play the night without having the feeling that i&#39;m currently watching a more or less black screen (hey i have amazing hd texture mod, i want to see them&#33;)\r<br />\r<br />To sum up, if you want more realistic night without losing the playability of the game (because it&#39;s a game) then you could try this &#33;\r<br />[center]\r<br />[size=4][u][b]Good to know[/b][/u][/size][size=4][u][b][/b][/u][/size][/center][center][/center][list][*][size=2]0 fps lost guaranted (only change vanilla value, nothing more)[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]compatible with everything[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2]safe to install / uninstall (no script) but it is always a good idea to have backup of your save...[/size]\r<br />[*]obviously not compatible with a mod that change night (will NOT ctd anyway, the mod will just be useless) exept enb but the night could be very dark (just test if you want to), compatible with everything else\r<br />\r<br />[*][size=2]easy install / uninstall (just drag and drop or delete the esp)[/size]\r<br />[/*][*][size=2]work well with saturation boost mod (i personally use this one :Â http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32064/? ) : [/size]\r<br />[/*][/list]\r<br />If you like the vanilla skyrim and prefer not using an ENB (or a no effect ENB only for parallax) this mod (or the original one) associated with a saturation boost mod can be a good alternative.\r<br />\r<br />I will try to update the mod as soon as possible if you notice some bad-looking night (not impossible)...\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u][b][center]Credits:[/center][/b][/u][/size]\r<br />[size=2][u]DISCLAMER : [/u]I&#39;m am not the original autor of this mod. I just modified the RGB value from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11356/?]Mike Foxs Darker Nights[/url]\r<br /> in order to adapt the night to my personal taste (with TES5edit).      \r<br />Mike Fox is the original author of this mod.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Mike Fox and Daos85 the originals autor and uploader of the great &#34;[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11356/?]Mike Foxs Darker Nights[/url]&#34;\r<br />[size=2]ElminsterAU[/size], [size=2]Hlp, Zilav and Sharlikran[/size] for creating and updating the incredibly well made [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859/?]TES5edit[/url]\r<br />and of course Bethesda for creating this amazing [s]beta[/s] game.\r<br />\r<br />PS : it&#39;s my first ever publication of a mod so i apologize in advance if i made some mistake here, just tell me :)\r<br />PS 2 : Sorry for my english, i hope i didn&#39;t write too badly (not my first langage)",
