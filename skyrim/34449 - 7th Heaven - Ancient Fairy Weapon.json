He who sees it is captivated.\\\"\r\n\r\nThis weapon has been a while in the making, and I feel that it\\'s finally ready for release.\r\n\r\nI\\'m planning on making weapons like this more frequently in the near future, and I\\'m going to create a questline to tie in with the weapons.\r\n\r\nThe 7th Heaven is a penultimate weapon from the Dark Cloud series, and it\\'s now finally introduced to Skyrim!\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only way to obtain the weapon is to travel to the top of the Throat of the World. You\\'ll find it hovering in front of the Word of Power.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/DcWNuA2l.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/fkCC8wwl.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/SMvgCbOl.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/SITaerQl.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/ZZHE5iDl.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThanks for any support! Please leave comments to give me suggestions and tips!\r\nPlease remember, this is my first sword ever, so please give constructive criticism!",
