  "descriptionHtml": "I tend to tinker a lot with various mods and things, and sometimes I end up doing stuff that might be worth publishing somewhere.  Instead of making a separate mod for every little thing I may come up with, I figured I&#39;ll just make one &#39;mod&#39; to publish them in.  This is pretty lean just now, I have no idea if/when I&#39;d end up adding more stuff here.\r<br />\r<br />If I make a patch, I try to follow the permissions given in the original mod, but if I&#39;ve made a patch for your mod and you want it removed - let me know, and I&#39;ll do so as soon as I&#39;ll see the message.  If you are the author of the original mod, and want to integrate the patch into it - as per note in permissions section, feel free to do so.",
