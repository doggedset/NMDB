  "descriptionHtml": "PLEASE NOTICE: As you can see I\\'m playing skyrim on the lowest possible graphics because my computer is really old. So this mod is going to look much better if you are playing at higher graphics!\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to machinima for showing my mod in one of their videos! You don\\'t know how much that means to me.\r\n\r\n[youtube]Ge2G8z8fjnE[/youtube]\r\n\r\nUPDATE 1.2: Fixed the Lags without removing the Lights!!\r\n\r\nChristmas is soon and so I decided to make this Christmas Overhaul for Whiterun to give you a Christmas feeling in Skyrim! It was really a lot of work to do this and I would be really happy if you would check this mod out and post your feedback in the comments.\r\nIt also adds a big christmas-tree in the middle of whiterun.\r\n\r\nBugs: If you find any bugs or gaps in the snow, please report them in the comments. I spent hours of searching gaps and I found many of them, but it\\'s almost impossible to find every single gap.\r\n\r\nHope you guys like it and have a nice day! ;)",
