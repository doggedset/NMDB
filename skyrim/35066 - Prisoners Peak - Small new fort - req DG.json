  "summary": "My first Dungeon I used to learn the CK, thought I might as well put it up for DL (Requires Dawnguard)",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a small fort I was originally planning to use for a short quest. (Requires Dawnguard) located just north of Riverwood along the road.  Its small, and will probably take the average player 15 minutes or so to run through. \r\n\r\nI\\'ll take all the constructive criticism you got!  This is my learning dungeon before I move on to tougher stuff.\r\n\r\nIts navmeshed, optimized.\r\n\r\n1.1:\r\nLikely last update, as I\\'m moving on to other dungeons.  Thank goes to CyrusAmell for constructive criticism. \r\n\r\n-Entrance made secret, now located outside north of Helgen.\r\n-Better environment backstory\r\n-Balanced OP loot and made enemies better scaled for SKYRE and higher difficulty users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequires:\r\nSkyrim.esm\r\nUpdate.esm\r\nDawnguard.esm\r\n\r\nCredit goes to bethesda for Skyrim.\r\n\r\nYou can use this interior/fort for personal use, though credit would be nice. \r\n\r\n-note: I appear to be having difficulty getting companions to follow you inside the tower.  I\\'ll try and figure it out but in the mean time if you have Advanced Follower tweaks you can always just teleport them to you. (or use the console.)\r\n",
