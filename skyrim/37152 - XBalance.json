  "descriptionHtml": "More extreme Balancing - More fun!\r\n\r\n- BEFORE USING THIS MOD I HIGHLY RECOMMEND READING THE CHANGELOG AND MAKING A BACKUP OF ALL YOUR SAVEGAMES\r\n\r\n\r\n- MOD PURPOSE:\r\n\r\nI created this mod to make the game a little more extreme. That means you die faster and so do your enemies. It turns out at some points in the game, the fighting feels a bit more realistic. However i find this way of playing fun in Legendary. It has all been tested in legendary and also only in early game stages, so i dont really know how this will change the end game. Please note that this is just a very early stage of this mod and there might be many updates.\r\n\r\n\r\n!!!!!!Also!!!!: You are welcome to give me notes about what you find good or bad in this mod and if there is anything else that you think should be changed and pushes the idea of a little less shooting flames for hours and a little more being dead - on both sides.\r\n\r\nI created this mod mainly to make the game more fun for me. If anybody has any ideas about how the game can be more fun or might even be appealed to work on the mod him or herself, feel welcome to let me know. \r\n\r\n\r\nupdate v.0.14\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\nNEW ENEMIES ADDED:\r\n\r\n- Driven Cultist: \r\n\r\nThe so called Driven Cultists roam Skyrim craving for power. They seek to destroy the Dragonborn, since they believe that the return of the Dragons is the Gods\\' call for them alone. They are unpredictable and can be found roaming the Wilds or as a part of Banditgangs or tribal clans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW ESSENCES ADDED:\r\n\r\nEssence of Archery\r\n\r\nIncreases your marksman skill for a certain amount of time\r\n\r\nCombinable with: Essence, Essence of the Spider\r\n_____________________\r\n\r\nEssence of Protection\r\n\r\nIncreases your health regeneration for a certain amount of time\r\n_____________________\r\n\r\nEssence of Life and Death\r\n\r\nSome Essence\\'s effect can be turned around. For example it is possible to make Essence of the Spider into Essence of Protection\r\n_____________________\r\n\r\nAll Essences can be found in the loot of the new added Creatures and Enemies. Except for Essence of Life and Death. It must be crafted out of 5 Essences.\r\n\r\n\r\npatchnote: I also included more combinations for the Essences.

Skills:\r\n\r\n\r\n- Destruction Perks:\r\n\r\n\r\n(\r\n\r\nNovice Destruction: Adds additional damage\r\n \r\nElemental Specalisations: Adds more additional damage\r\n\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Restoration Perks:\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice Restoration: adds additional amount of healing\r\n\r\n\r\n- Spells:\r\n\r\n\r\nFlames, more Damage, same cost (destruction school)\r\n\r\nSparks, more Damage, same cost (destruction school)\r\n\r\nOakflesh+Stoneflesh, longer duration, higher armor rating (alteration \r\n\r\nschool)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Armsman Perk, more additional Damage\r\n\r\n\r\n- Overdraw Perk tweaked, more additional Damage\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Inventory\r\n\r\n\r\n- All unenchanted Weapons have been modified to do more damage\r\n\r\n\r\nHints:\r\n\r\nThere is a golden Ring in Helgen, on the Barrel next to the one where you \r\n\r\nget the first potions, that increases your health by 50\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Enemies\r\n\r\n- Dragons have more starting Health\r\n\r\n- Driven Cultist: \r\n\r\nThe so called Driven Cultists roam Skyrim craving for power. They seek to destroy the Dragonborn, since they believe that the return of the Dragons is the Gods\\' call for them alone. They are unpredictable and can be found roaming the Wilds or as a part of Banditgangs or tribal clans.\r\n\r\n4. Animals and Enemies\r\n\r\n- New Animals added:\r\n\t\r\n\tDemonwarg; looks like an icewolf, but is just                    \t\r\n\r\n           badass and bigger, will be encountered in early game stages\r\n\r\n           Carries: Essence, Essence of the Warg\r\n\r\n        Large Brown Bear: Like the name says. Carries: Essence, Essence of the Bear\r\n\r\n5. Essence\r\n\r\nEssence is what i call a new thing that i built in, in order to one day replace the alchemy system, since i find it utterly ridiculous. You find Essences that you can combine with each other, in e.g. the loot of dead animals, like the Large Brown Bear (Also part of the mod). Use them like potions to enhance your abilites. Essences are not supposed to be crafted, only found and combined. This part of the mod is particularly work in progress. As i will  add new Essences, the combinationpossibilities will grow. Also there might be much tweaking happening, since i am not alltogether sure about how strong the essences can and must be, in terms of balancing.\r\n\r\n- Types: \r\n\r\n           Essence\r\n\r\nDoes nothing by itself, but is a standart ingridient for all possible combinations.\r\n\r\n           Essence of the Bear\r\n\r\nEnhances your smithing skill greatly for a certain time.\r\n\r\nCombinable with: Essence\r\n\r\n____________________\r\n\r\n           Essence of the Warg\r\n\r\nEnhances your one handed and two handed fighting for a certain time.\r\n\r\nCombinable with: Essence, Essence of the Spider\r\n____________________\r\n\r\n           Essence of the Spider\r\n\r\nPoison that can be applied to weapons\r\n\r\nCombinable with: Essence, Essence of the Warg, Essence of Archery, Essence of Life and Death\r\n____________________\r\n\r\nEssence of Archery\r\n\r\nIncreases your marksman skill for a certain amount of time\r\n\r\nCombinable with: Essence, Essence of the Spider\r\n_____________________\r\n\r\nEssence of Protection\r\n\r\nIncreases your health regeneration for a certain amount of time\r\n_____________________\r\n\r\nEssence of Life and Death\r\n\r\nSome Essence\\'s effect can be turned around. For example it is possible to make Essence of the Spider into Essence of Protection\r\n_____________________\r\n\r\nAll Essences can be found in the loot of the new added Creatures and Enemies. Except for Essence of Life and Death. It must be crafted out of 5 Essences.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
