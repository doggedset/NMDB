  "descriptionHtml": "Version: Alpha 0.01 Uploaded for people who wanna try/test and give feedback :D\r\n\r\nThis Project was started about a month ago, it should have been updated alot more but i haven\\'t had the time for it:( Atleast the Alpha is up for those who are interested.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this mod is to add several Legendary Weapons to Skyrim in a uniqe way of crafting them. Every weapon needs a certain unique item to be crafted that is obtained by scouring the lands and such or defeating certain opponents. \r\n\r\nI want this mod to be a sortof collector mod. Have you ever played Demon\\'s Souls or Dark Souls? All weapons in those games were unique in that you have to aquire a certain soul from a certain boss and so on. In the end its a collectors game and you feel really proud when you have them all. I want to add that kinda feeling to Skyrim however making it more challenging.\r\n\r\n I intend to make all weapons only to be crafted once (hence Legendary) by adding materials only aquireable once, some maybe during a Main Quest sequence so that if youre already done that then youre screwed and such. A part which i liked about the aforementioned games.\r\n\r\nCurrently:\r\n\r\n9 Weapons are avaible and the respective items can be found in the world. You need dragon smithing in order to craft each item. Can\\'t figure out them enchants right, was much easier with the Oblivion Construction Kit, oh well. \r\n\r\nWhat to add/do:\r\n\r\n-Hint Book\r\n-Lore Book\r\n-More Weapons\r\n-Special Forge\r\n-Fine tuning crafting recipies\r\n-Fix and balance enchants\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDaggers\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nName: The Black Seal\r\nWeapon Type: Dagger\r\nCurrent Skin: Ebony Dagger\r\nMaterial: Crystallized Hunger\r\nLore: Never full of it, the Crystallized Hunger is an appropriate name for the Soul Gem which never is filled. This dagger is born from the same hunger, sealing the very soul of its victim. Used by the sinister Necromancer, Surfk, he tried to fill the dagger with the souls of every living beign to appease Hermaeus Mora. He eventually took his own life with the dagger which shattered it into fragments and returned to its shape original shape. The dagger is bound to its master and should the bond ever be broken, so will the dagger.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nOne Handed Swords\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nName: Ryu Metsu\r\nWeapon Type: Katana\r\nCurrent Skin: Akviri Katana\r\nMaterial: Bolar\\'s Oathblade\r\nLore: Wielded by the Grandmaster of the old Akaviri Dragonslayers. Aptly named Ryu Metsu  (Dragon Annihilator in Japanese according to Google Translate), every dragon it faced it slew. How powerful the Grandmaster was is not certain but he eventually fell to Alduin. Bolar knows little of his swords origin and it is infact the same blade yet unpolished.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nName: Core of Inferno\r\nWeapon Type: Sword\r\nCurrent Skin: Glass Sword\r\nMaterial: Canister of Flame\r\nLore: One of three, these triplet swords were forged to the Three Knights of Elements. Three hero knights who togheter had journeyed near and far in search for a cure of a mysterios plague, they each wielded their own element. As gift of honor for completing their great mission these sacred swords were made. Each of the swords had a piece of each element imbued into their blades. A slither of the first flame, a piece of the magical ice of Loruun and a fragment of lightning, caught by a boys bare hands later using it to restore peace. Each of these majestic elements were stored in Canisters to hold forever. Alas only three remain, but where?\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nName: Core of Ice\r\nWeapon Type: Sword\r\nCurrent Skin: Chillrend\r\nMaterial: Canister of Cold\r\nLore: See Core of Inferno.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nName: Core of Thunder\r\nWeapon Type: Sword\r\nCurrent Skin: Chillrend\r\nMaterial: Canister of Lightning\r\nLore: See Core of Inferno.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTwo Handed Swords\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nName: Core of Elements\r\nWeapon Type: Greatsword\r\nCurrent Skin: Glass Greatsword\r\nMaterial: Core of Inferno, Core of Ice, Core of Thunder\r\nLore: Should two of the Three Knights of Elements fall, the last surviving knight were to assume the role of the Knight of Element, safeguarding the kingdom of old.
