  "descriptionHtml": "After completing the Companions\\' quest line, I was disappointed that there was no place to put Wuuthrad after I was done. And since leaving it on that statue at Ysgramor\\'s Tomb is out of the question (it just falls off, later), I decided to make this simple little addition.  Now there\\'s a plaque down in the Harbinger\\'s Quarters of Jorrvaskr where Wuuthrad can be placed.\r\n\r\nOne small bug I should mention, though.  For some reason, anything that is put on this plaque can\\'t be removed.  However, since I never planned to lug Wuuthrad around, anyway, I just accepted it.  However, if anyone can tell me how to fix this, I\\'d really appreciate it and I\\'ll fix it.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.",
