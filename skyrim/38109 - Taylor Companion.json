  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is working, however it is a work in progress. I will continue to improve on Taylor&#39;s looks. In the future I will make her a stand alone companion. However this is my first mod so it may take a little while for some features.\r<br />\r<br />If anybody knows how to change the greeting for a particular NPC please pm me or let me know how to do this in a post. I did find the dialogue menu in the creation kit but its pretty confusing.\r<br />____________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />Updates:\r<br />v1.1 Taylor now has her own set of vanilla glass armor. I will add a version with the remodeled armor in the near future.\r<br />\r<br />____________________________________________________________________________________________\r<br />Installation:\r<br />To install simply drop Taylor.esp into your data folder and activate using the NMM. Then click launch.\r<br />\r<br />In order to activate Taylor after the golden claw quest you must open the command console and enter the following lines in this order to turn her into a follower. This is until i can figure out a way to integrate this into the file. You need only do this once so then save.\r<br />\r<br />stopcombat\r<br />removefromallfactions\r<br />setrelationshiprank player 4\r<br />addtofaction 0005a1a4 4\r<br />addtofaction 0005c84d 4\r<br />setplayerteammate 1\r<br />\r<br />After this is entered you should be able to do the normal follower things with her.\r<br />I will be removing her annoying claw related dialogue in a later version.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Required for mod to work:\r<br />Apachii Skyhair female standalone v1.3\r<br />Caliente&#39;s body replacer CBBE v3.2\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Recommended:\r<br />Cbbe v3.2 Armor replacer by MAK07 \r<br />\r<br />",
