  "descriptionHtml": "If this needs an update or change just PM me. I have not modded or played Skyrim for quite some time but am planning on some new stuff. All my old mods were made from requests and probably have incompatibilities and/or are obsolete at this point. I don&#39;t even have the original files but I downloaded backups.Â \r<br />\r<br />This was made in response to a request. \r<br />\r<br />This mod removes the swirls from Stendarr&#39;s Aura spell. This only removes the annoying swirls, nothing else.\r<br />\r<br />If anyone would like me to expand on this and change some other spells or anything, just PM me and I will get back to you. \r<br />\r<br />Please endorse if you like this mod.\r<br />\r<br />PM me for more requests, ideas, advice, complaints, etc.\r<br />\r<br />Check out my other mods here:\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/7172874/?tb=mods&pUp=1",
