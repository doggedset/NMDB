  "summary": "Modifies weights and armor ratings of heavy armors to create two types:  lighter, but weaker medium armors, and very heavy but sturdy heavy armors.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Do you wish that you felt more like an unstoppable titan in your heavy armor? Do you wish you didn\\'t have to sacrifice mobility for protection? Do you want to sneak around in something that actually protects you?\r\n\r\nThis may be the mod for you!\r\n\r\nInspired by Morrowind\\'s different Armor levels, I have modified Skyrim\\'s existing heavy armor and broken it down into 2 types:\r\n\r\nMedium Armor: (weighs less, but has a lower armor rating)\r\n===============================================\r\nBasic Iron Armor\r\nFalmer Armor\r\nWolf Armor (Companion Armor)\r\nAncient Nord Armor\r\nOrcish Armor\r\nBlades Armor\r\nDragonplate Armor\r\n\r\nUnique Items:\r\nYngol\\'s Helm\r\nTarge of the Blooded\r\nJagged Crown\r\nEbony Mail (provides highest armor rating of all medium armors, similar to Morrowind)\r\n\r\nHeavy Armor: (weighs a lot, but provides a substantial armor rating)\r\n======================================================\r\nBanded Iron Armor and Shield\r\nImperial Heavy Armors (including General Tullius\\' chest piece)\r\nSteel Armor\r\nDwarven Armor\r\nSteel Plate Armor\r\nEbony Armor\r\nDaedric Armor\r\n\r\nUnique Armors:\r\nShield of Ysgramor (now only surpassed by Daedric Shield)\r\n\r\n=====Dawnguard=====\r\nMedium Armor: \r\n==============\r\nDawnguard Heavy Armor\r\nFalmer Hardened Armor\r\n\r\nHeavy Armor: \r\n============\r\nFalmer Heavy Armor\r\n\r\nUnique Armors:\r\nAetherial Shield\r\nShellbug Helmet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArmors listed by rating within their categories.\r\n\r\nNote: All armors still use the Heavy Armor skill for perks/skill boost.\r\n\r\n*******Also, to balance having heavy but powerful armor, the Steed Stone******\r\n******* now only reduces weight of worn armor by 50%, instead of 100%. ******\r\nHeavily armored chargers still moved slower than their more lightly armored counterparts :P\r\n\r\nSo have fun as either a slow but powerful juggernaut, or a more mobile but still armored warrior. Please provide any feedback, as I haven\\'t fully tested to make sure every single item has been changed (best way to tell is via weight, if you feel like checking against vanilla, you can find all the weights on the Elder Scrolls wiki. Most, if not all, are different).\r\n\r\nAlso available on Steam workshop:\r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=108769251]Vanilla Version[/url]\r\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=108785125]Dawnguard Version[/url]\r\n\r\nThis mod was cleaned with TES5Edit v. 3.0.24",
