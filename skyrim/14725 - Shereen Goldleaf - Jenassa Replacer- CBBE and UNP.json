  "descriptionHtml": "Shereen Goldleaf Half-elf {FalmerBane Edition}\r\n\r\n04/09/12 UPDATED: I reduced her speed from 300 to 100. She should be able to strut now using the Catwalk mod. \r\n\r\n\tThanks for checking out my personal edition of my Shereen mod. She\\'s a level 30 Half-elf that will return to the Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun when you dismiss her. She was formerly the Hireling Jenassa and is a replacer. This is my custom version and the one I use in my game. I have another version of Shereen available in my Jenassa Half-elf mod as I know mine will not appeal to everyone. That version has less makeup, is a little taller and has more of a human skin tone and darker hair coloring.  If you like a little more color, really cute and a touch of deadly thrown in, I think you will instantly fall in love with my personal version of Shereen. \r\n\r\nShe has custom color makeup and war paint to match her eyes. Her skin has a custom light green tint to it in keeping with her dark elf and human heritage. She is very petite at about 5 feet tall and 115lbs. I used elements from my Lydia mod on her face so she may look a bit familiar if you use that mod. She prefers the bow and dual flurry in combat also in keeping with her heritage. \r\n\r\nStats: I have given her Calculated mechanics at level 30\r\nInventory: Elven Dagger, Sword, Bow and 150 Elven Arrows. NO CLOTHES!!! She will appear nude. \r\nVoice: Young Eager\r\nHair: Custom light blonde coloring by me with style by (*)Apachii SkyHair\r\nEyes: Dark Elf Unique\r\nFace: (*)Bella\\'s Better Female Faces - Makeup Version 1 \r\nBody: Petite at about 5 feet tall (.94) and weight around 115-20 lbs (30) (*)Dimonized UNP or CBBEv3 (I use (*)Navtsea\\'s body mod textures over them for more muscle tone, better seams (on CBBE) and better looking genitalia (on UNP).) \r\n\r\nIf there is an (*) Asterisk by the named mods above downloading these files will help make her look like my mod in the images I uploaded.\r\n\r\nGetting her to display properly: \r\n\r\nInstall ApachiiSkyhair - Many people forget to do this and it is ***required*** for this mod!\r\n\r\nUse the right body type! If you are using CBBEV3 in game use the CBBE file, if you are using the UNP body use that file.\r\n\r\nOnce you install my mod you will need to start your game and go to the Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun. You will find Shereen there nude possibly with her head floating above her body and a discolored face. The fix for this is below. \r\n\r\nOpen Console (~) Click on Shereen anywhere to show her Ref ID Number. Type in Console (setnpcweight 30) and (setscale 94). Now do a NEW save game and then close Skyrim. Restart Skyrim and she should now be perfect! :) \r\n\r\nMy take on Makeup on Female and Male NPC\\'s not being \\\"Lore Friendly\\\"\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of people playing this game that think the use of make-up is not lore friendly and so they are hesitant about using character mods like mine that use makeup or beautification mods. I would ask you to consider these following historical tidbits in relation to being lore friendly. Makeup is documented to have been used by the Ancient Egyptians over 3,500 years ago by paleontologists. Makeup was also documented to be in use by the Greeks, Romans and other ancient societies, including tribal body and face painting by Ancient Briton and Germanic tribes. To me it is completely plausible for makeup to be used in Skyrim given Bethesda supplied it and used it in the game on its own NPC\\'s. Inescapably Skyrim\\'s lore is tied to our history in some way shape or form, the latest \\\"trend\\\" of having NPC\\'s look more natural is more likely a current trend in modern use of makeup and not a direct reflection on the lore of this game or any game that that bases its lore partially on human medieval and ancient history. It is inarguable that Skyrim spans the times from early man to the late 16th century with the various in-game elements it provides us. Note the use of mammoths and saber tooth cats and then fast forward to some of the more modern items in the game such as steel bear traps (which were recorded to be first in use in the late 16th century). It is perfectly fine and period to this game to have your characters kicking ass in black eyeliner, eye shadow and red lipstick. Don\\'t let someone tell you it isn\\'t lore friendly because it really is. Given the choices of races we have in Skyrim it may not only be lore friendly but very plausible on some characters depending on their status and rank within their society. In the end it is completely your choice on how you want your NPC\\'s and PC\\'s to look. I personally am not interested in having androgyny rule my game so I opted to creating and sharing my own female characters that cannot be mistaken for anything else. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading,\r\n\r\nFalmerBane",
