  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][u][b]Lord Commander&#39;s Quarters[/b][/u][/size]\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m sure there are plenty here who were both impressed yet underwhelmed with the Dawnguard HQ. Namely, like most guilds of Skyrim, it has a poor player&#39;s room. Here I&#39;ve changed this for all of you who enjoy the Dawnguard to have a modest yet powerful new quarters. Here you&#39;ll find a new 3-part chamber that&#39;s positioned above the entrance hall, with windows both interior and exterior overlooking the canyon (because dang it&#39;s dark everywhere). \r<br />\r<br />It includes: \r<br />- 5 weapon racks, 1 sword/shield plaque, 2 mannequins and a large display case.\r<br />- 1 single bed with custom statics, like a mirror and mounted dragon skull.\r<br />- 2 bookcases, one a container and the other the usual shelved kind. \r<br />- A privacy door. Honestly, now. \r<br />- A nice desk and custom chair next to the fireplace. On it should be 3 Reaper fragments so you don&#39;t have to hunt all over the Soul Cairn for them.\r<br />\r<br />I hope everyone here enjoys this small edition to Fort Dawnguard, a guild with still much potential to be had. \r<br />\r<br />Installation: \r<br />- Just one ESP file to extract into your Skyrim &gt; Data folder.
