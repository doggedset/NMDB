  "descriptionHtml": "Description\r\nThis mod replaces the Robe of the female Archmage and nothing else.\r\nThe male version remains as provided by Bethesda.\r\nThe robe is quite revealing. Anyone who has problems in seeing his char\r\nin candid dresses, should not use this mod. You have been warned!\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nPlugin: Archmage Arynns Replacer\r\nAuthor: Arynn\r\nFile Size: 3.7 MB\r\n\r\nDependencies: A nude bodyreplacer is recommended.\r\nI have used the following mod:\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=70\r\nLanguage: universal, because only the meshes and textures are replaced.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\nAfter extracting the 7z archive just the copy and paste the files acording the file structur. Thus, the original archmagerobe is replaced by mine. \r\nThe gown actually comes with a cap. Those who do not want the cap: open the console and type: 7C932 player.equipitem\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstalling\r\nSimply delete the folders \\\"Data \\\\ meshes \\\\ clothes \\\\ archmage\\\" and \\\"data \\\\ textures \\\\ clothes \\\\ Arynn \\\\ archmage\\\".\r\n\r\nErrors\r\nIf errors are found, please give me a PM.\r\n\r\nThis Replacer consists of the meshes and textures of Thalmor robe.\r\nI\\'ve reviewed, adjusted and equipped the textures with an alpha channel. The original meshes of the Thalmor robe are all still there, they were hidden by this alpha channel. \r\nSince that time, when I created this replacer, no editing of meshes\r\nwith a 3D program was possible, it will logically lead to clipping errors. A complete body was plugged into the robe, unfortunately the Weight Painting of the body doesn\\'t match\r\n100% with the robe. So you have to live with that.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\nMeshes and textures belong to Bethesda Softworks. I have only altered them a little. If someone wants to use my data, I do not mind as long as my name is mentioned and the description and a link is given to my origninal mod.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\nI\\'ld like to thank:\r\n• Rigani for testing\r\n• The forum \\\"Spieleabend\\\" for the constructive criticism\r\n• The Forum PAGAN TES mods for hosting and excellent support\r\n• Thepal for his mod \\\"Nude Females\\\"\r\n• Bethesda for a great game.\r\n\r\nHave fun with the plugin!\r\n\r\n<Salute>\r\n\r\nArynn",
