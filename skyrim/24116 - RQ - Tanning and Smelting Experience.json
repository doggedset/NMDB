  "descriptionHtml": "This mod simply makes it so that the tanning rack and the smelter use your Smithing skill, and you get experience for it.\r\n\r\nNote that I wouldn\\'t use this mod myself, since I feel that Smithing already levels probably too fast, but my friend wanted this mod and I saw another request for it, so I made it for her (and you, if you want it, of course).\r\n\r\nSince this only changes exactly 2 objects, and only a single drop-down menu in each, I don\\'t see why this would be incompatible with any other mods. (Honestly, this is so small I feel kind of silly uploading it, but I couldn\\'t find anything that did the same already.)\r\n\r\n(The picture came from UESP. </attribution> :) )\r\n\r\nAs always ratings/endorsements and sharing are appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: D\\'oh. Helps to upload a file, huh...? >>",
