  "summary": "Darkens the black, and removes the colour from the Dark Brotherhood armour and robes.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod changes the Dark Brotherhood armour and robes. The grey is changed to black, and the red is changed to a greyish black. Looks much cooler, I think. This also affects your buddies back at the Sanctuary. \r\n\r\nIf you are using one of the fine mods that improve the textures on armour and clothes, you will have to overwrite those to use these (though it will only effect the Dark Brotherhood clothes). However, due to the darker colours, the flaws are much less noticeable in-game. I tried to sharpen these a little, but I\\'m no texture artist, so you probably won\\'t notice much of a difference. \r\n\r\nIf you want other colours, such as a schnazzy purple, give us a hoi and I\\'ll see what I can do (I might be a little late, because it\\'s rather hard to tear myself away from Skyrim). \r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\n - Installation Instructions - \r\nExtract the \\'textures\\' folder from the archive using WinRAR or 7Zip, and place it in your Skyrim\\\\Data folder. Overwrite if prompted. \r\n\r\n - Incompatibilities - \r\nAnything that changes the Dark Brotherhood armour or robes. \r\n\r\n - Tools - \r\nFallout Mod Manager to extract the textures from the BSA.\r\nGIMP + plus DDS plugin to modify the DDS. \r\nWinRAR to create the archive.
