Read here for more information[/url]]\n<br />\n<br />Makes the Dawnguard helmets and shield enchantable.\n<br />\n<br />Notes: \n<br />\n<br />Because they already have effect descriptions, you will not be able to see that they are enchanted. I strongly recommend renaming them at the enchanting table so as not to mix them up with other Dawnguard helmets and shields. You can verify that the enchantment was applied by equipping the item and checking your magical effects list.\n<br />\n<br />The Dawnguard Rune Shield has not been changed.",
