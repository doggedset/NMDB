  "descriptionHtml": "Very powerful Character. For those who have trouble battling past all the mod monsters they have at a lower level. ;) Enjoy.\r<br />\r<br />Maff Gol, the red and mighty Blood Orc; an adventurer or many names - &#34;Warskin&#34;, &#34;Dremora Bane&#34; and &#34;Son of Malakath&#34;, he has ventured to Skyrim seeking one he deems worthy to fight with him at their side. He asks no questions, for he is able to determine the skill and integrity of a warrior with merely their presence. It is said that due to his blindness, Maff Gol relies on his sense of smell to hunt down any offenders, and his keen listening skills to hone in on even the slightest movement across large distances.\r<br />\r<br />He may be found in Riverwood, at the Sleeping Giant. Will he fight along side you?\r<br />\r<br />Also, if you find he is too OP, i can re-upload a tame version for those who prefer it :)\r<br />\r<br />(Also, my first mod :D I think I did okay, even though it isn&#39;t terribly complex :) )",
