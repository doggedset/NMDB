  "descriptionHtml": "[b][u][color=#00ff00][size=4]Description / Instructions[/size][/color][/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Fed up of running around in Skyrim trying to find all the smithing materials you need, or cheating the hard way looking for console codes and adding them one by one. It takes forever!\n<br />[size=4][color=#f6b26b]Now you can cheat the easy way just by typing one console command[/color] [/size]- great for when you've played Skyrim several times and you just want an easy life! Or if you set up multiple profiles with mod organizer and want to progress quickly. \n<br />As an added bonus if you find you have too many smithing materials you can sell them to merchants, make loads of money and buy Skyrim! [color=#f6b26b][size=4][i]T[/i][/size][/color][i][color=#f6b26b][size=4]he total list adds about 30,000 septims worth of materials - do this 10 times and you have 300,000 septims worth.[/size][/color] To repeat the command just press the up arrow while you're in the console and you can scroll through your last commands.[color=#a2c4c9] [/color][/i]If you feel this is too much of a cheat you can always drop the items out in the middle of nowhere.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6d9eeb]IMPORTANT[/color] - you may find you're carrying too much and slow down to a walking pace - you can increase the total amount you can carry by using the following command...\n<br />player.setav carryweight x (where x is the total weight you can carry - I normally use about 40,000 but sometimes have gone up to 250,000)\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#00ff00][size=3]Installation[/size][/color][/u]\n<br />Simply copy the file into your [u]Skyrim[/u] directory (where you installed Steam - not the data directory as you would with normal mod files). Then open the console by pressing the tilde key (`) and type in the command...\n<br /> bat AddSmithing\n<br />[i][color=#f6b26b][size=4]Now you have most of the smithing ingredients you will need to make armor, weapons etc.[/size] [/color]It takes a minute or so to add all of the items to your inventory. [/i]If you need to add more, just type the command again. If you don't like the quantities added by this mod, just edit the text file and include however many you need of each item, or add new items - using a semicolon before a command will remove the item (it will just be treated as a comment instead of a command). For example, if you no longer wish to add dragon scales, type a semi-colon before \"player.additem 3ADA3 5; Dragon Scales\" which would look like this... ;player.additem 3ADA3 5; Dragon Scales\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][color=#00ff00]FILES INCLUDED IN ZIP FILE[/color]\n<br />[/u][/b]\n<br />[size=3][i]AddSmithing      - adds all smithing materials in the following quantities...[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#ffff00]Quantities Added[/color][/u]\n<br />10 Corundum Ingot\n<br />10 Corundum Ore\n<br />10 Dwarven Metal Ingot\n<br />10 Ebony Ingot\n<br />10 Ebony Ore\n<br />10 Gold Ingot\n<br />10 Gold Ore\n<br />10 Iron Ingot\n<br />10 Iron Ore\n<br />10 Silver Ingot\n<br />10 Silver Ore\n<br />10 Steel Ingot\n<br />10 Orichalcum Ingot\n<br />10 Orichalcum Ore\n<br />10 Quicksilver Ingot\n<br />10 Quicksilver Ore\n<br />10 Refined Malachite\n<br />10 Malachite Ore\n<br />10 Refined Moonstone\n<br />10 Moonstone Ore\n<br />\n<br />5 Dragon Scales\n<br />5 Dragon Bone\n<br />\n<br />5 Dwemer Cog\n<br />5 Dwemer Gear\n<br />5 Dwemer Gyro\n<br />5 Dwemer Lever\n<br />5 Dwemer Scrap Metal\n<br />5 Solid Dwemer Metal\n<br />5 Small Dwemer Plate Metal\n<br />5 Bent Dwemer Scrap Metal\n<br />5 Small Dwemer Lever\n<br />5 Large Dwemer Strut\n<br />5 Large Decorative Dwemer Strut\n<br />5 Large Dwemer Plate Metal\n<br />\n<br />3 Bear Pelt\n<br />3 Cave Bear Pelt\n<br />3 Chaurus Chitin\n<br />3 Cow Hide\n<br />3 Deer Hide\n<br />3 Elk Hide\n<br />3 Fox Pelt\n<br />3 Goat Hide\n<br />3 Horse Hide\n<br />3 Ice Wolf Pelt\n<br />3 Sabre Cat Pelt\n<br />3 Sabre Cat Snow Pelt\n<br />3 Snow Bear Pelt\n<br />3 Wolf Pelt\n<br />\n<br />30 Leather\n<br />30 Leather Strips\n<br />\n<br />2 Flawless Amethyst\n<br />2 Flawless Diamond\n<br />2 Flawless Emerald\n<br />2 Flawless Garnet\n<br />2 Garnet\n<br />2 Flawless Ruby\n<br />2 Ruby\n<br />2 Flawless Sapphire\n<br />2 Sapphire\n<br />\n<br />10 Firewood\n<br />1 Woodcutter's Axe\n<br />\n<br />[/size][u][size=4]\n<br />[color=#00ff00]Using mod managers[/color][/size][/u]\n<br />If you use profiles with Mod Organizer, don't put the file in the profile folder, just the main Skyrim folder. I don't think any mod manager will install this for you - you have to do it manually! If someone knows how to get a mod manager to do this please feel free to edit at will...\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#ffff00]Compatibility[/color][/u]\n<br />Shouldn't clash with anything as far as I know - these files don't use any resources or scripts and aren't installed like normal mods in the data folder so they shouldn't cause any problems. It should also count as an extra mod you can have without adding to the limit that mod organizer can handle!\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#ffff00]Incompatibility[/color][/u]\n<br />Nothing as far as I know - please let me know if this mod crashes your game, causes glitches in the matrix or steals your girlfriend. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#9900ff][size=4]Please let me know if there are any items you feel I've missed.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#ffff00]Uninstallation[/color][/u]\n<br />Simply delete the files and refrain from using the bat command anymore. Alternatively, delete the files, use the bat command and ponder why it's not working.\n<br />\n<br />Feel free to copy, hack, exploit, edit, reverse engineer, infringe copyright (there are none) upload to other sites, or do whatever else you want with the files, with the exception of charging for them or uploading them to a site that will charge for them. These files are free to anyone and everyone who wants them!\n<br />\n<br />[color=#d9ead3][u]CREDITS[/u][/color]\n<br />Bethesda, Steam, Nexus - you rock!\n<br />Me!!!\n<br />My family for putting up with my computer and gaming addictions! (The wife said why haven't I done the online shopping instead of doing this?) pfffft!\n<br />:D\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cc4125][size=4]Please see my other mods...[/size][/color]\n<br />[color=#6d9eeb]Instant Potions... http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67308/?\n<br />Instant Perks... http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67269/?\n<br />Instant Shouts... http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67318/?\n<br />Instant Skyrim spells... http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67322/?\n<br />[color=#6d9eeb]Super Powerful Weapons and Armor... http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68236/?[/color][/color]\n<br />\n<br />This is my second mod so please be patient, support isn't going to be that great.
