  "summary": "A small tool that restores your Skyrim install to a vanilla state.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b]*v2.5 now available* [/b]with a brand new UI and lots of new features: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4697/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4697/?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Skyrim Restore[/b] is a small Windows executable that temporarily moves vanilla files from the Skyrim folder, purges that folder and any configs then restores the vanilla files.\r<br />\r<br />It doesn&#39;t know or care about NMM or Mod Organizer - it&#39;s just designed to return Skyrim to the state it was in when first installed.\r<br />\r<br />To do its job it needs to know where your Steam folder is located i.e. [b]C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam[/b] - it&#39;ll work if you&#39;ve installed Steam on a different drive too (assuming you put in the correct path).\r<br />\r<br />It also has an extra feature: if you give it the path to a .7z archive (say D:&#92;Archives&#92;Skyrim_Mod_Archive.7z for example) it&#39;ll extract that archive over the vanilla Skyrim install, overwriting if necessary - I use it to try out/install different ENB setups.\r<br />\r<br />The chosen archive is extracted directly into the Skyrim folder so if you wanted stuff to go in Skyrim/Data you&#39;d need the Data folder to be in the root of the archive.\r<br />\r<br />This is a tool I developed for my personal use - use it at your own risk - no warranties etc. If your Skyrim&#39;s a mess and re-installing&#39;s your only option then this may just help. ",
