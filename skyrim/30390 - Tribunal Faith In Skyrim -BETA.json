  "summary": "A mod made by me to increase the presence of the largely forgotten Tribunal Temple in Skyrim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The Tribunal Temple\\'s treachery was revealed to us at the end of Morrowind, and since the fall of the Almsivi Tribunal, and the Dunmer have since returned to their old ways of ancestors, and the three \\\"good\\\" Daedra.  However, I\\'m sure I\\'m sure that I\\'m not the only one who thought that the priests, ordinators, and other Temple devotees took the Temples downfall really easily!  History has proven that you can\\'t stop a religion just by telling people it\\'s false, even if you present them with facts.  That\\'s where this mod comes in.  This adds a presence (albeit a small one) of an enclave of tribunal worshippers to Skyrim.  I intend to expand upon this mod ALOT, as I have much yet to learn about the creation kit.\r\n\r\nIn this release: \r\n~A Tribunal-worshipping enclave in the sulfur wastelands of Eastmarch\r\n~Ordinator guards\r\n~Tribunal Priests\r\n~An-Xileel agents with an unmarked base (notes and general knowledge of argonians should help you find it)\r\n~A potential player home occupied by a Ex-Tribunal priest turned to daedra worship\r\n~Two unmarked quests\r\n~And more!  \r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n~Tamira/Stroti (for Stroti\\'s Rustic Furniture, and Small House Resources) \r\n~Natterforme (for his Ordinator Armor Resource)\r\n~DocterPepper/Zairaam (for his Tribunal Robes & Masks Resource)\r\n~Oaristys (for his clutter resource)\r\n~scot (for his morrowind style mushrooms resource)\r\n~kimern88 (for his argonian mercenary armor)\r\n~RonnieMagnum (for his Noble Artifacts For Skyrim Trueflame & Cleaver Of Saint Felms\r\n~Phitt (for his cliffracers, which aren\\'t quite implemented yet)\r\n~Insanity (for his Insanity\\'s Lanterns Resource)\r\n~Leodoidao (for his Stalactites resource)\r\n~Trainwiz (for his Mask Of Sotha Sil)\r\n\r\nBugs: None that I know of, other than the cleaver of Saint Felms Doesn\\'t have the right enchantment (I Can\\'t figure out how to make a weapon enchantment that fortifies carry weight, and drains magicka)\r\n\r\nHelp:\r\n-I need help in the areas of;\r\n      ~Script writing\r\n      ~Quest writing\r\n      ~Modeling/Texturing/adding new objects\r\n      ~Rigging Phitt\\'s cliffracers\r\n      ~Adding the original enchantment to the Cleaver of Saint Felms\r\n      ~Navmeshing\r\n\r\nDon\\'t use anything from this mod without the permission the those whose assets I used.\r\n\r\n~Dragonborn Version is Out!",
