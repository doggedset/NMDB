  "descriptionHtml": "ALTERNATE START\r\n\r\n===BASED ON \\\"A Poor Man\\\"===\r\nBasically, it\\'s \\\"A Poor Man\\\", with minor changes.\r\nItÂ´s called \\'Skyrim Alternate Reality Savegame\\' now, and it\\'s by StannieDum, so all credits go to him.\r\nIt can be found here:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5720\r\nIt has been superceded by this mod: \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10929\r\nAlthough I haven\\'t played that one, I recommend you do, because it\\'s worked out way better, according to the descripton.\r\nSpecial thanks to Arbabender, for finding the original mod and pointing it out to me.\r\n\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nIt\\'s just a simple savegame, just with the main quest disabled, and no map \r\nmarkers yet discovered.\r\n\r\nYou start off on a small ship at the Solitude Docks, nothing but shaggy clothes \r\nyou\\'d have as a prisoner. \r\nYou\\'re an Imperial named Crassius, but that\\'s just the character I created for myself.\r\n\r\nJust open the console and type  \\\"showracemenu\\\" (Obiously without the \\\", but \r\nI figured you\\'d be smarter than that.) and make yourself a new character.\r\n\r\nIf you want to start anywhere else, go to www.skyrimsearch.com, \r\nlook up which cell you want to start in, and type \\\"coc <chosen starting cell>\\\" \r\n(Again, don\\'t be stupid.) and then you\\'ll just have to finish it off with a nice\r\n \\\"tmm 0\\\" to disable the map markers again.\r\nDifferent starting gear? Dump those rags, and conjure yourself a nice set of \r\nclothing, a fancy blade, or even a complete set of armor using the \\\"player.additem <form ID>\\\" \r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nThis way, you can create your very own start with your own backstory, for a \r\nway more immersive and enjoyable game.",
