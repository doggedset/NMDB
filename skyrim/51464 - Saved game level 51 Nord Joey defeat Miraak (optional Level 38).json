  "descriptionHtml": "If you are looking for a nice start over while skipping some boring quest, you might like this saved game:\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51600\r<br />\r<br />Update 30-Dec-2014\r<br />\r<br />Apologies for last file that none of the saves have dragonborn finished. So I played through &#34;At the Summit of apocrypha&#34; and made another save.  I reset the light armor perk at the end of the quest.\r<br />\r<br />Update on 17-Aug-2014 NO LAGGING&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; clears the lagging problem in game and reduced file size. If you need help for fixing add me on steam (kin459011). \r<br />\r<br />These files are corrupted before but just repaired using this utility, worked magically.\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53045/?\r<br />\r<br />Note: \r<br />I deleted some of the objects at Breezehome....check this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZScwvmiKuo\r<br />So there is no alchemy room there. I am still checking how to restore this.\r<br />I think I also have a house in solitude and maybe in markarth. You also have one house of the dragonborn dlc as I have completed dragonborn quest.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Level 50 Specs:[/u]\r<br />Quests\r<br />Main quest finished\r<br />Thief guild joined and mostly finished...for other guild quests see level 38.\r<br />Joey has heavy armour on as default, but i usually just equip her with mage robes at this stage, as she is still quite strong without armour on. She has high level in heavy armour, two-handed, smithing.\r<br />Her block and destruction is still levelling up. \r<br />You can level her up on keeping on using magic, or block with heavy armour OR light armour with alteration spells on.\r<br />Joey&#39;s Partner is Lydia, she should be with you to Solstheim. and you might need to have the Amazing Follower Tweaks mod installed or you might need console commands to get back her.\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15524/?\r<br />\r<br />Quest mod recommended to install play with:\r<br />Helgen reborn: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35841/?\r<br />Civil War Recurring Sieges: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53318/?\r<br />Falskaar and Wyrmstrooth are also good quest mods to play with, but beware the files are quite big\r<br />\r<br />-----------------\r<br />\r<br />[u]Level 38 Specs[/u]\r<br />Quests:\r<br />Main quest finished\r<br />Just started the thief guild quest\r<br />Finished the Dark Brotherhood, Companion and Mages Questline\r<br />Dawnguard (Dawnguard side), still have some quests to do\r<br />Dragonborn - not started as this questline is very buggy to me\r<br />\r<br />Her Partner is  Erik the Slayer and have breezehome as home and storage. A lot of stuff there so go search the chests and cupboards.\r<br />You should install the marriage mod. It is ok if you don&#39;t, I have tested that Erik still wears clothes.\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50121/?\r<br />\r<br />Skills\r<br />Still have 1 perk left.\r<br />She is mainly a one-handed light armour warrior\r<br />One-handed 100\r<br />Light armour 89\r<br />Two-handed, Block, Archery 50+ \r<br />Destruction 61\r<br />Other mage skills 20-30+\r<br />Smithing 51\r<br />Enchanting 42\r<br />\r<br />What you can do from this level:\r<br />You probably should use more magic and start heavy amour.\r<br />Alteration, restoration and illusion is easy to help level up yourself. \r<br />Keep casting alteration spells on yourself to level up, and Courage spell on your follower.\r<br />You should also keep up smithing, better to smith heavy armour and increase the heavy armour skill. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Mjoll is with the Blades (Aerin will also be there). I put her there mainly because I don&#39;t like Aerin keeps repeating, &#34;I don&#39;t see Mjoll being upset blah blah blah.. the city really goes to her.&#34; while he approaches me in Riften.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Add me on Steam&#33; (kin459011). \r<br />\r<br />Mods that recommended you to have installed:\r<br />Amazing Follower Tweaks\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15524/?\r<br />\r<br />Remove annoying Lines (Lydia will not say &#34;I am sworn to carry your burdens&#34; after this mod is installed&#34;)\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16359/?    \r<br />OR\r<br />http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=63625509\r<br />\r<br />Comestics:\r<br />Coverwomen: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3563/?\r<br />Fine Face Textures for Men: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27815/?\r<br />Hvergelmirs Armor Retexture: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3261/?",
