  "descriptionHtml": "The Riverwood Hideaway is a hidden home and shop for the Breton Kids. They are older than they seem. They specialize in stealth, information, & magic. \r\n\r\nThis adds a bazaar for you to buy things, and sell things. \r\n\r\nYou have a few trainers here as well.\r\n\r\nThere is a garden here, and they are fairly open about such things.\r\n\r\nYou are free to spend the night, but just so it is clear, it is THEIR home, and you are a guest. If you find storage, it\\'s for them, not you. (Storage is NOT safe)\r\n\r\nRequirements :\r\nThis requires Dawnguard \r\nThis requires Hearthfires\r\n",
