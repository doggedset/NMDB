  "summary": "THIS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MALUKAH SONG MODS\r\n\r\nThis particular song is a more fitting song for the main menu",
  "descriptionHtml": "Entirely inspired by:\r\n\\\"Intro music replacement by Malukah\\\" by Malukah for the song and Nodus Cursorius\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2101\r\n\r\nMalukah is an amazing singer on youtube who has done a handful of amazing skyrim covers. Her songs can be found here:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/malufenix/videos\r\n \r\nWhat Nodus Cursorius\\'s mod did was it made the main title song \\\"The Dragonborn Comes\\\" cover by Malukah. It also increased the volume of the song for it to not be quite in game. I personally feel that this music is to vibrant and not ambient enough to be main menu music.\r\n\r\nWhat this mod does: Instead of \\\"The Dragonborn Comes\\\" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z9TdDCWN7g&feature=plcp) this mod makes \\\"Malu Canta Skyrim\\\" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=ULM1vZ3UaAytc&feature=player_detailpage&v=M1vZ3UaAytc#t=13s) the main menu music. To me this song better reflects a main menu type of song. It is quieter and is mainly ambient. I altered the audio and managed to make a decent loop of the song and raised the volume without to much quality loss. I had to make the loop at the point with none or almost no sound due to skyrim making an annoying click sound even if I looped it perfectly at a point with sound. Annoying because i managed to get this song to loop flawlessly on Audacity.\r\n\r\nInstall: \\\"Just drop data folder in your skyrim root install directory dummy, why didn\\'t you think of that? For your health!\\\"\r\nOr if you\\'re feeling lazy then just click the download with Manager button!\r\n\r\nI highly recomend this mod to further compliment your main menu experience:\r\n\\\"main menu wallpaper replacer HD 1080p now with randomizer\\\" by hellstorm102\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3708\r\n",
