Now they match glowing Daedric Armors. Enjoy! :)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/size]I honestly am confused by the texture artists of Skyrim. Like how do they justify mushy, splotches with a few scant scribblings of details as textures??\n<br />It literally gets to me that bad that I honestly forced myself to learn how to texture just so I didn't have to endure the eyesores ingame................And here we are today. The daedric arrows and quiver needed some serious remastering (pun. as. always. intended.)  Why Bethesda didn't actually remaster any of the textures when they \"remastered\" Skryim is beyond me.................but anyway I'm getting sidetracked.  \n<br />I basically reimagined (in glorious 4k) how Daedric arrows/quiver should look whilst keeping close to the vanilla aesthetic to keep it lore friendly. LORE FRIENDLINESS IS KEY MY FRIENDS! :) Well I think it is.....\n<br />\n<br />I honestly don't think anyone reads the descriptions so I could probably say whatever the hell I want and no one would be the wiser...... In that case I'll just say this here. If you are a user of mods and you don't make mods yourself, do everyone a favour and don't leave negative or pushy feedback in the mod comments. You're literally getting a piece of art for free.  No one forced or asked anyone to mod we literally do it because we love it and we want to share our passion with others so they might benefit from passion projects such as these. So please take a second to think of that before you start jabbing, and shitting all over mod authors okay? \n<br />And instead perhaps leave some constructive feedback or drop an appreciative :) or &lt;3. \n<br />Cheers. Thank you Brother!. Much appreciated. Have a great day. Love your work. Carry on sir/maam! \n<br />\n<br />Every part of the texture has been carefully crafted to resolve detail making your eyes happy in-game. Continue to enjoy the glory of 4k arrows!\n<br />I am uploading and sharing this mod as I have been an avid skyrim player for years, using hundreds (more like thousands) of mods. So it's time I continue giving back to this awesome community.\n<br />This is a replacer.\n<br />\n<br />This mod contains the meshes for MANY reasons. One being Bethesda thinks Daedric arrows require some weird red tint specular.....which I can honestly say just looks weird AF. So I modified it.\n<br />Versions include:\n<br />- 4k Daedric Quiver and Arrows Red\n<br />- 4k Daedric Quiver and Arrows White\n<br />- 2k Daedric Quiver and Arrows Red \n<br />- 2k Daedric Quiver and Arrows White\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#980000][size=6]I[/size][/color]nstallation:[/b]\n<br />Download and install with NMM/MO, otherwise place in data folder.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#980000][size=6]F[/size][/color][size=2]AQ[/size][/b][size=2][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12371]\n<br />\n<br />[/url][b]Why are the colours so bright and saturated?[/b]\n<br />It's my personal enb settings. Depending on your setup the colour intensity will vary.\n<br />However when creating my retextures I aimed for a balanced level of saturation/brightness.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Can you add a version with this coloured feathers/wood/leather?[/b]\n<br />If there is enough interest\n<br />\n<br />[b]I hate your retextures![/b]\n<br />Congratulations.You have an opinion. Feel free to not download my mod and move on \n<br />\n<br />[b]There's no need to have 4k textures[/b]\n<br />What's the point of posting that?[/size][size=2]\n<br />\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=4][i]\"Heim Hin Miiraad Alun Amativ\"\n<br />[/i]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />A huge shout out to Bethesda for creating the best game series of all time!",
