  "descriptionHtml": "Hey everyone, so this is my very first mod. Like, ever. So hopefully it works alright. Anyways, this mod is very very simple, it adds a single follower for the Dark Brotherhood faction in the game. You can find him in Four Shields Tavern in Dragon Bridge. Like I said, very simple, no fancy custom voicing or anything, though I hope to learn how to do that eventually. I would very much recommend this mod: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12015/?     Better Shrouded Armor, kudos to H4lfD3ad for making that. I personally think that it very much improves the DB armor in the game, but hey, to each his own, right? Anyway, I hope this works for everyone, and I know its really simple, but like I said, first time :P Enjoy&#33;",
