  "summary": "in the spirit of Halloween I present to you my slenderman mod. It is my attempt to recreate the game \\\\\\\"slender.\\\\\\\" \r\n\r\n",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is WIP, not finished yet. \r\n\r\nYou must collect 8 pages, each time you do slenderman will spawn closer to you. Being next to slender man drains your health very fast, so if you see him run away. You only have a torch and a lantern to see (both work the same, but the player can choose which one they like) \r\n\r\nThis mod is best used with visual mods that make skyrim darker. \r\n\r\nvideo of gameplay-http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOcP0NxonL0&list=UUHAPfbp2ToeXaLgno01EpJQ&index=1&feature=plcp\r\n\r\nPlease visit my youtube channel for more upcoming videos and news on this mod. http://www.youtube.com/user/battlefield3media?feature=mhee",
