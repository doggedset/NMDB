  "descriptionHtml": "I usually play a light armored character, and the Masque of Clavicus Vile is one of my favorite helmets in the game. I got a mod called Altered Masque of Clavicus Vile, but  I thought the enchantments on it (and all other Daedric Artifacts for that matter) were really wimpy, so I got improved Daedric Artifacts, which overwrote the Altered Masque of Clavicus Vile. So there I was with a heavy armored Masque. Then I decided to make this mod, which has all of the Improved Daedric Artifact enchantments, and is light armor.\r\nIt is statted to be slightly better than Elven Armor.\r\n\r\nMake sure this is below Improved Daedric Artifacts in your load order.\r\n\r\nCredits: Prothescar, creator of Improved Daedric Artifacts.",
