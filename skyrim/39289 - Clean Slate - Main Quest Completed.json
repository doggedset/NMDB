  "descriptionHtml": "I got tired of having to re-do the main quest every time I wanted to play a new Skyrim character, just to get Dragonrend. Fighting dragons as a melee character is quite annoying without it...\r\n\r\nSo I created this \\\"clean slate\\\" save file of a completely vanilla character (no mods - the only thing required is a version of Skyrim updated to 1.9) with the main quest completed. I tried to keep the quest log as clean as possible: there are no misc quests for things like \\\"join the Stormcloaks\\\", or \\\"join the Imperial Legion\\\". Below is the data from this save file:\r\n\r\n-Have not decided whether or no to kill Paarthurnax\r\n-During Seasons Unending, Markarth was given to the Stormcloaks, and Winterhold to the Imperials -The Thalmor ambassador was allowed to stay; Ulfric had to pay compensation \r\n(I wanted to be even, but I couldn\\'t stand the though of the most corrupt person in all of the Empire, Maven Black-Briar, being given even more power)\r\n-All shouts encountered on the main questline are unlocked\r\n-The quest Discerning the Transmundane is advanced up to the point of possessing the runed lexicon, but not having returned to to Septimus Signus\r\n-The miscellaneous quest to find someone to identify the mysterious gem (I only picked up the one outisde the Thalmor Embassy) is active\r\n-The golden claw has been obtained, but not returned to Riverwood\r\n-No couriers have given any letters\r\n-Minimalistic chat options were selected with everyone\r\n-The College of Winterhold was joined, but Mirabelle Ervine has not been talked to\r\n-No houses have been bought\r\n-No horses have been bought\r\n-The character has almost no money or items, other than uniques picked up during the main quest\r\n\r\n\r\nTo install: extract the save file, and place it inside your Skyrim save directory. This is usually located at C:/Users/<YOURUSERNAME>/Documents/Games/Skyrim/Saves\r\n\r\nTo uninstall: simply delete the file from the aforementioned location\r\n\r\nUpdate log\r\n---------------------\r\n1.0 - Initial Release\r\n1.1 - Fixed some character statistics that I forgot to reset to default (run speed and carry weight).",
