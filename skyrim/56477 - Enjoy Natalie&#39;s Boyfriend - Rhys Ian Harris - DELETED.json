You can find me wondering around riverwood but for some reason sometimes I dont show up I have found during testing so if that is the case for you then I have a simple fix :) bring up the console with the tilde key (~) right next to the number 1 and type in &#34;help rhys&#34; without the quotations and get the code in bracets then again go to the console and type &#34;player.placeatme xxxxxxxx 1&#34; without the quotations and the X&#39;s being the code to have me appear right in front of you.\r<br />\r<br />Also with my custom armor to get me to wear it just trade with me and take my armor then give it back and then I should be wearing it. As for my custom weapon again bring up the tilde key (~) and type &#34;player.additem 030012CA 1&#34; without quotations and then again trade with me and give me the sword.\r<br />\r<br />Sorry for all these little fiddly things I was having a bit of trouble with it all this time around but hopfully I can get it fixed soon and release a lil patch for it.\r<br />\r<br />At first I&#39;ll release just as a standard follower (V1.0) and then after the initial release I will be working on voice acting and quests etc for my mod of myself, hopefully along the line I can convince Natalie to do it with me as she didn&#39;t end up getting around to voice acting her own mod and then intergrate her follower mod and myself together into a couple follower mod which I haven&#39;t seen before and think would be really awesome. I cant promise anything on her part though but I can promise mine will have it.\r<br />[line]\r<br />[img]https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/t1.0-9/10150572_10152402965224189_4257952281861824507_n.jpg[/img]\r<br />[line]\r<br />Thank you so much to &#34;frankdema&#34; for allowing me the use of his &#34;Nordic Ranger Outfit&#34; in my mod.\r<br />\r<br />Thank you so much to &#34;Elvarheim&#34; for allowing me the use of his &#34;Glimmer&#34; in my mod.\r<br />[line]\r<br />[img]https://scontent-a-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/t1.0-9/10270824_10152402965709189_6646931807125246817_n.jpg[/img]\r<br />[line]\r<br />Use NMM to install or if your doing it manually then just copy the files downloaded here and place them in your skyrim data folder and say &#34;yes&#34; if asked to merge anything.\r<br />[line]\r<br />[img]https://scontent-b-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/t1.0-9/10291794_10152402965374189_2040155054134122673_n.jpg[/img]\r<br />[line]\r<br />Just deactivate in NMM or delete the &#34;Rhys Ian Harris&#34; files and the meshes and textures you can go find them to remove otherwise no harm done if they are just left there.\r<br />[line]\r<br />[img]https://scontent-a-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/t1.0-9/1926670_10152402938794189_6948887723605270470_n.jpg[/img]\r<br />[line]\r<br />Enjoy My Girlfriend - Natalie\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52835/?]Nexus Download Link[/url]\r<br />[img]http://static-4.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/thumbnails/52835-1-1397064504.jpg[/img]\r<br />[line][/center]\r<br />",
