  "descriptionHtml": "Long story short, I was messing around and -voila&#33;- this terrible thing came into existence. ... Actually, it&#39;s quite useful, IMO, especially if you&#39;re hella lazy like I am but you also like enchanting stuff and brewing poisons and stuff like that. This bat file includes EVERY SINGLE PERK aside from Purity, which is completely pointless, honestly - half the time you&#39;re concocting somthing, it&#39;s for septims and skill, not what the effects are. So, here is my first (and probably only) upload to the Nexus. Hope you find it as useful as I have&#33;\r<br />\r<br />X,\r<br />Blotchy",
