  "descriptionHtml": "There is some similar mods, but this one a little different.\r\nFirst and foremost - it based not on khajiit race power, but on \\\"The Vision of the Tenth Eye\\\" spell (which you acquire through master illusion quest).\r\nSecond - this spell is alteration school while other mod spells is illusion.\r\n\r\nI use Realistic Lighting mod, so this spell is imperative for stealth character if you think sneaking with a torch or candlelight spell somewhat unrealistic.\r\n\r\nDetailed spell info:\r\nAdept level alteration spell\r\nMagika cost - 259\r\nCK Value - 400 gp\r\nDescription:\r\n\\\"Transforms some of your cone cells in the retina of the eye to the rod cells, thus allowing you to see in the darkness for 120 seconds.\\\"\r\n\r\nYou can buy this spell from any vendor who sells alteration spells of adept level.\r\n\r\nIssues:\r\nSince original spell casts with both hands, and it seems to be scripted somewhere, you cannot dual-cast this spell because when this spell in right or in both hands default animation played. There is also interesting glitch when you have this spell in the right hand and another spell in the left. Both spells work, but dual-cast animation of the spell in the left hand used.\r\n\r\nWhen this spell in the left hand everything works perfect with all possible combinations (weapons, other spells, bare handed).\r\nAnd since i planned to use this spell in the left hand and i failed to find where dual-cast animation scripted (out of ideas at the moment), there is little chance for future updates.\r\n",
