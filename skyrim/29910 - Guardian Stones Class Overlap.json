  "descriptionHtml": "This is a very simple .esp that assigns some of the \\\"overlapping\\\" skills for the Guardian Stones. The Mage Stone now includes the Alchemy bonus, and the Warrior stone now includes Marskman and Light Armor bonuses.  An optional version adds One Handed to the Thief Stone.  I thought it fit for daggers, but seemed a bit unbalanced otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis will obviously interfere with any other mod that changes these stones.  It\\'s such a small change that I wasn\\'t going to bother uploading it, but then I totally did.  What a cool story!\r\n\r\nHere is a complete list of the skills that the stones will now affect.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mage Stone=\r\nAlchemy (added by mod)\r\nAlteration\r\nConjuration\r\nDestruction\r\nIllusion\r\nRestoration\r\nEnchanting\r\n\r\n\r\n=Warrior Stone=\r\nBlock\r\nHeavy Armor\r\nLight Armor (added by mod)\r\nMarskman (added by mod)\r\nOne Handed\r\nSmithing\r\nTwo Handed\r\n\r\n\r\n=Thief Stone=\r\nAlchemy\r\nLight Armor\r\nLockpicking\r\nMarskman\r\nOne Handed (added only in optional version)\r\nPickpocket\r\nSneak\r\nSpeechcraft\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd no, I didn\\'t really fill the Guardian Stones with dead cave bears.",
