  "summary": "The Nook\r\n\r\nI had started out just messing around with the new DLC creation kit content and was not satisfied with the original player home in RavenRock. So I decided to make this player home for my self and was not going to list it on the nexus. After putting some work into the mod i figured why not list it.",
  "descriptionHtml": "The Nook\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nThe house it self has the same layout of Glover Mallory\\'s house in RavenRock. Most of the furniture in the player home is of noble status. I added all the essentials that a player home should have in it.\r\nTo find the key for the home search the road outside RavenRock near the dead Redoran Guard. If you do not want to find the key open the console with the \\\"~\\\" key and type \\\"COC 1thenook\\\". Another method is to open the console and click on the door and type \\\"unlock\\\". \r\n\r\nThe Nook now has two versions:\r\nVersion 2.3: Is just the player home with its resources and all issues were fixed with the home.\r\nVersion 2.4: Is the player home with an additional 2 more buildings next to The Nook. One is a bar called the Black Shalk Corner Club with a Vendor and random npcs. The next building is a basic home for Morrowind Refugees called the Refugee\\'s Bunk House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCrafting:\r\n1x Anvil\r\n1x Alchemy Table\r\n1x Enchanting Table\r\n1x Staff Enchanting Table\r\n1x Armor Workbench\r\n1x Leather Rack\r\n1x Weapon Grinder\r\n1x Cooking Spit\r\n\r\nDisplay: \r\n8x Weapon Plaques\r\n1x Weapon Rack w/5 slots\r\n8x Shield Plaques\r\n2x Mannequins\r\n2x Display Cases\r\n\r\nStorage:\r\n\r\n6x Book Shelves\r\nXX various containers\r\n\r\nI made sure to add a lot of storage to this player home. Most of all the shelves are actual containers. Exsample would be in the Alchemy area the potions on the shelves are indeed containers. There is also a special key container located on the wall next to the main entrance.\r\n\r\nExterior:\r\n\r\nI did make some changes to the exterior of the house. I added a dock in the back of the house and some lanterns. Also added some trees in the front.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\nDragonborn\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n***When updating please be sure to take your items out of the home and delete the old esp.***\r\nThe install is very simple. Either install with with NMM or just drag the ESP into your data folder of skyrim.\r\n\r\n\r\nResources & Credit:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16525\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11618\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14134\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14133\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14135\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14136\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks to Blary & Oaristys for adding most of those wonderful resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nChange log:\r\n\r\nVERSION 2: DO NOT USE THIS VERISON IT IS BROKEN. DELETE THIS ESP AND USE VERSION 2.1.\r\n\r\nVERSION 2.1: Fixed the container bug. Door is now locked. To find the key explore the road outside of Raven Rock near the dead Redoran Guard. Or you can open the console and type \\\"COC 1thenook\\\"..\r\n\r\nVERSION 2.2: Now has all the resources used in the mod for people having issues with the meshes and textures not showing. Fixed some items that were slightly clipping.\r\n\r\nVERSION 2.3: Fixed issue with followers not able to come in the home. \r\n\r\nVERSION 2.4: Added 2 new buildings next to The Nook to make Raven Rock look less like a crumbling town. Comes with a new bar and NPC named the Black Shalk Corner Club and Refugee\\'s Bunkhouse.",
