  "summary": "Replaces 1-hand idle animation",
  "descriptionHtml": "Replaces 1-hand idle animations, with or without shield, with another very familiar animation.\r\nTurn animations can also be replaced so they don\\'t do the annoying jerking motions.\r\n\r\nAll I did was take Aurawind\\'s Dual Wield 3rd person dynamic idle stance (The link is gone now :( ) and renamed it to the appropriate 1-hand idle animations. I did it for the turning animations as well, but the feet don\\'t shuffle or move while turning, so sorry if that bothers you, but perhaps someone can make a mod to adjust that.\r\n\r\nAlso, wanted to add that it doesn\\'t really work with 1-hand + magic in offhand. It\\'ll just look weird, so sorry if you\\'re into that.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION: \r\nExtract and replace Data folder in Steam > SteamApps > Common > Skyrim if you use Steam, or just extract and replace in your Skyrim directory.\r\n\r\nTo remove the animations, just go to Data > Meshes > actors > character > animations and delete 1hm_idle, 1hm_turnleft60, 1hm_turnright60, 1hm_turnleft180, 1hm_turnright180.\r\n\r\nI haven\\'t encountered any problems, myself, so enjoy.",
