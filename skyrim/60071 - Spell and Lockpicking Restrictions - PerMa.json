  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ff0000][u][b][size=4]Introduction[/size] [/b][/u][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00]NOTE: There&#39;s a version of Spell Perk Restrictions for Vanilla, SkyRe, Requiem and Ordinator available [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58987/?]here[/url]. Be sure to check it out if you&#39;re using any of these overhaul.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />This is a small tweak to be used alongside PerMa in order to make learning magic and opening locks more difficult, yet also more realistic.\r<br />\r<br />My mod is 100% script free, so there should be no harm for your save game.\r<br />\r<br />It was inspired by the mod [b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/43057/?]&#34;Tomes - Immersive Spell Learning&#34;[/url][/b] by pointed86 and [b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29979/?]&#34;Lock Overhaul&#34;[/url][/b] by Quad2Core.Â  Which are both great mods which I really liked, but sadly they&#39;re incompatible with PerMa.\r<br />\r<br />While my small tweak is not nearly as fancy, I made an attempt to recreate the overall effect: making spells and locks require a perk.\r<br />\r<br />I have found it very immersion breaking when I came across a spelltome, just have to click it and be able to cast the spell, regardless of any of the magic skills of my character.\r<br />\r<br />In many cases, it was possible to use a high level spell, on a character with only level 15 in that school of magic. \r<br />\r<br />Also, opening locks is supposed to be an art. A novice should not be able to open Master level locks, in my opinion. It takes time and effort to understand the mechanics of locks.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][u][size=4]Spells Restrictions[/size][/u][/color]\r<br />\r<br />This part of the mod multiplies the Magicka cost of spells you don&#39;t have the perk (the Studies perks in PerMa) for, by 5. So in most cases, you won&#39;t be able to cast them at all without the correct perk. Lorewise, without the perk, you don&#39;t have the proper grasp of that magic school to fully comprehend the spell and therefor cannot cast it properly. Like Farengar hints: you need aptitude to be a great wizard.\r<br />\r<br />I have given the Player NPC (00000007) a set of perks which multiplies the Magicka cost of all tier grade spells by 5.\r<br />\r<br />By &#34;tier grade spells&#34; I mean the ones that belong to any of these perks:\r<br />\r<br />Restoration Novice\r<br />Restoration Apprentice\r<br />Restoration Adept\r<br />Restoration Expert\r<br />Restoration Master\r<br />\r<br />Destruction Novice\r<br />Destruction Apprentice\r<br />Destruction Adept\r<br />Destruction Expert\r<br />Destruction Master\r<br />\r<br />Alteration Novice\r<br />Alteration Apprentice\r<br />Alteration Adept\r<br />Alteration Expert\r<br />Alteration Master\r<br />\r<br />Illusion Novice\r<br />Illusion Apprentice\r<br />Illusion Adept\r<br />Illusion Expert\r<br />Illusion Master\r<br />\r<br />Conjuration Novice\r<br />Conjuration Apprentice\r<br />Conjuration Adept\r<br />Conjuration Expert\r<br />Conjuration Master\r<br />\r<br />Ingame, in the spell menu, you can see which of these perks each specific spell belongs to. \r<br />\r<br />When you invest in the corresponding perks, the Magicka cost will return to its base value. Which makes the spells useable again. \r<br />\r<br />This mod does not only apply to Vanilla and official DLC spells, but also to most spells added from other mods that belong to any of the \r<br />perks mentioned above. Meaning it&#39;s compatible with most spell mods. i.e.: the restrictions will also apply to most spells added other mods.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][size=4][u]Lockpicking Restrictions[/u][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />For lockpicking, I reduced the chance of opening a lock, you don&#39;t have the correct perk for, to zero. \r<br />\r<br />I have added following perks to the Dexterity tree:\r<br />\r<br />(Novice can be opened without a perk)\r<br />\r<br />- Studies: Apprentice Locks: level 25 in Dexterity\r<br />\r<br />- Studies: Adept Locks: level 40 in Dexterity\r<br />\r<br />- Studies: Expert Locks: level 65 in Dexterity\r<br />\r<br />- Studies: Master Locks: level 90 in Dexterity\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][u][size=4][b]Installing[/b][/size][/u][/color]\r<br />\r<br />NMM/MO: Just install with your mod manager of choice.\r<br />\r<br />Manually: Copy &#34;Spells & Lockpicking Restriction - PerMa.esp&#34; into your Skyrim&#92;Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][u][size=4][b]Uninstalling[/b][/size][/u][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Uninstalling mods is not recommended by Bethesda, and I do not recommend it either.\r<br />\r<br />However, as my mod uses no scripts, you should IN THEORY be safe to just uninstall, by deleting it from your load order. \r<br />\r<br />If you&#39;re planning on removing the Lockpicking part, you might have to reset your perks in Dexterity. If you&#39;re not sure how to do that, I&#39;ll link you to this video (a bit old, but still works): [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfBFq_MknE]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqfBFq_MknE[/url]\r<br />[color=#ff0000][u]\r<br />[size=4][b]Known (in)compatibilities[/b][/size][/u][/color]\r<br />\r<br />As I said, my mod should be compatible with most other spell mods, but if not, please feel free to report.\r<br />\r<br />My mod is incompatible with mods that also alter the Player NPC (0000007). However, if you know how to use Merged Patches, you might be able to make them compatible. \r<br />\r<br />This mod is designed to be used alongside PerMa. You NEED the PerMa Master file, otherwise you&#39;ll CTD on startup.\r<br />\r<br />Also, don&#39;t forget to rerun PatchusMaximus after installing this mod.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ff00]Compatible[/color]:\r<br />\r<br />- [color=#00ff00]Skyrim Unbound[/color]: Now fully compatible, just load my mod after Skyrim Unbound.\r<br />\r<br />- [color=#00ff00]Duel Combat - Realism[/color]: Fully compatible, load my mod after Duel Combat Realism.\r<br />\r<br />- [color=#00ff00]Destroy the Thieves Guild[/color]: Fully compatible, load my mod after this.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000][u][size=4][b]Credits[/b][/size][/u][/color]\r<br />\r<br />pointed86 and Quad2Core - For inspiring me to make this mod.\r<br />T3nd0 - For his amazing work on Perkus Maximus.\r<br />Gopher - For his great tutorials and inspiring me to mod and make mods.\r<br />Bethesda - For making this awesome game and the ability to mod.\r<br />The whole modding community - For making the game even more awesome&#33; &lt;3\r<br />\r<br />I hope you like my mod.\r<br />\r<br />Kind regards :)\r<br />\r<br />Andre",
