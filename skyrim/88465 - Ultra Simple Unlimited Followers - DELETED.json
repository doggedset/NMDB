  "modName": "Ultra Simple Unlimited Followers - DELETED",
  "summary": "A tiny esp that makes a single variable constant, allowing the player to have unlimited followers. Does nothing else.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Allows the player to have unlimited followers by making PlayerFollowerCount a Constant. What this means is not only will the amount of followers you have always be 0, the game will also ignore the value in your save when loading, meaning you don't even have to dismiss your current followers before installing or uninstalling.\n<br />\n<br />Like my other mods this was created while playing. Felt like keeping my follower and Serana with me during the Dawnguard questline this playthrough but couldn't find a simple mod to do so. I'm sure there are others who will find this useful.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />=====Installation=====\n<br />\n<br />Place the esp in you Data folder and enable it or install the mod with NMM.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />=====Compatability=====\n<br />\n<br />Should be compatible with any custom followers, voiced or vanilla.\n<br />\n<br />I don't know how this mod interacts with Follower System Overhauls like EFF, UFO, AFT, etc, use at your own risk.\n<br />\n<br />=====Uninstallation=====\n<br />\n<br />Delete the esp from your Data folder or uninstall the mod with NMM.\n<br />Dismiss all your followers to return to the vanilla system.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />=====Observations=====\n<br />\n<br />I did some testing before uploading to see how the game actually interacts with constant variables.\n<br />\n<br />Installing the mod without dismissing your current follower just works out of the box since the engine ignores constant variables in your save on load. Apparently the variable wouldn't have been saved to begin with according to the documentation for both[url=https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Global] Skyrim [/url]and [url=https://www.creationkit.com/fallout4/index.php?title=Global]Fallout 4[/url].\n<br />\n<br />Uninstalling the mod without dismissing your followers loads your current follower count and not the default global value of 0. Oddly enough you can continue to recruit unlimited followers as long as you do not dismiss them all or essentially, return PlayerFollowerCount to 0. This most likely means the follower system was designed from the very start with 1 follower in mind and doubles as self maintenance as you can neither have negative nor incorrect values for PlayerFollowerCount through regular dialogue.",
