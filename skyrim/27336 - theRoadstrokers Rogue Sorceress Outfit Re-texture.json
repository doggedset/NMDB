  "descriptionHtml": "Rogue Sorceress Outfit re-texture by CrimsonFairy\r\n\r\nNOTE: This mod is just a texture replacer, and only contains the textures! You still need the original mod [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21313]here[/url].\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nDescription\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nThis mod is a black and purple re-texture of theRoadstroker\\'s Rogue Sorceress Outfit. I\\'m not planing on doing any more re-textures for this armor because I hate my texture editor program, and this will probably be my last re-texture mod until I get a better program.\r\n\r\nColors may be brighter, darker, more or less saturated depending on what graphic enhancers or ENBs you use. I use FXAA Post Process Injector to make the colors a little more saturated(see screenshots), but you can use whatever color enhancer or ENB you like. :) Have fun!\r\n\r\nPlease do not ask me to make a standalone version, because I don\\'t have permission nor the time to make one. I\\'m also not doing any more retextures for this outfit, so please do not request it.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nRequirements\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nJust the original mod [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21313]here[/url]. Download the main file, not the Cloak Stand Alone.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nInstall/Uninstall\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nExtract files from archive into Skryim data folder. Click yes to all, and when asked if you want to overwrite file, click yes/move and replace.\r\n\r\nTo uninstall go to Data/Textures/armor/theRoadstroker/Sorceress and delete Main_diff and Misc_diff or overwrite it with the original textures.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nCredits\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nBethesda for making Skyrim.\r\ntheRoadstroker for his AMAZING work in the original mod.\r\nJason Cham.\r\nAnd the Nexus creators and staff for their awesome website.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nUsage\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nYou are not allowed to upload this mod to any other site without my and theRoadstrokers permission. And you are not allowed to use this in any of your own mods without theRoadstrokers permission either.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nBugs\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nThe texture works fine for me but if you have any problems/bugs then please let me know so that I can address them as quickly as possible!
