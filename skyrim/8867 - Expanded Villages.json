  "descriptionHtml": "PROGRESS UPDATE 7-14-12: Even though Expanded villages is \\\"complete\\\", I planned on re-releasing a more dense version made from scratch + companion fixes. This means there would  of been even more houses along with more types, detail & neatness. But when I tried using CK, I kept getting errors midway through & losing my work. The way this happens, i would have multiple ESP. files saved & required for every time it crashes. I thought of making an esp for every village, possibly bundles of 2, but I don\\'t know if this feels like a high priority. If there is a big demand for a new version, then I may try this & get an update released. Just let me know if you really need this.\r\n\r\n-You might be able to tell I\\'m not too experienced with CK, so let me know if you\\'d like to or can help to make this easier.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nExpanded Villages is now completely finished & updated\r\n*Finished updating navmeshes for all added buildings*\r\n\r\nThis mod adds more buildings to towns & villages to help give off of a more populated look.\r\nThere aren\\'t any interiors & this mod is just for atmosphere.\r\n\r\n8 locations have been modified:\r\nRiverwood +21\r\nDawnstar +16\r\nDragonbridge +10\r\nFalkreath +13\r\nIvarstead +14\r\nMorthal +12\r\nRorikstead +14\r\nShor\\'s Stone +5\r\n\r\nCan conflict by clipping with other building mods in villages.",
