Just look at the image, and match the sliders accordingly in your Logitech Gaming Software user interface. This preset is made with surround sound off; but still sounds pretty good with surround switched on.\r\n\r\nThe music I felt sounded better with my settings as per a request by N1h1LuS ^_^ :\r\n\r\nFrom Games:\r\nHalo – Rock Anthem for Saving the Universe \r\nHalo – Main Theme from Halo Combat Evolved\r\nSkyrim – Main Theme (if I bring 1k up to -2 from -5)\r\nHalo 3 – Bonus Track: Love Your Friends\r\nHalo 2 – Halo Theme Mjolnir Mi\r\nHalo Reach – Overture\r\n\r\nPop/Rock\r\nSoilwork – (Death/Heavy/Scandinavian Metal)\r\nOomph! – (Heavy/Alt/Industrial Metal; Indie Rock; Electro-Industrial)\r\nRammstein – (Heavy/Alt/Industrial/Progressive Metal)\r\nMumford & Sons – (British Fold; Alt/Indie Rock; Indie Pop/Folk)\r\nJustice – Genesis (the only song I really like from them =P)\r\nDamageplan – (Post-Grunge)\r\n\r\nPop/Rock;International\r\nKoopiklaani – (Psychedelic; Folk-Rock; Heavy/Scandinavian/Black Metal; Nordic Traditions; Finish Folk)\r\n\r\nI think you get the idea of my music taste by now ;)\r\n",
