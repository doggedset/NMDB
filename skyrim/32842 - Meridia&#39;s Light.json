  "summary": "Staff to replace a boring vanilla torch. You can carry it just like you carry a torch to get the light, use it to block magical attacks and of course look like undead will burn in its light.\r<br />Note: It deals 3 points of sun damage per second only and will not replace your primary weapon in any case.",

Why in such a huge world with wizards, dragons, werewolves, bloody vampires and who knows what else there is NO light staff?&#34; Fear no more&#33; Because now you have such a thing.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Description:[/b]\r<br />Meridia&#39;s Light is a legendary staff. It&#39;s main purpose - replace boring torch in your journeys through fantasy world of Skyrim, especially it&#39;s caves and dungeons crawling with undead. But this staff can do more than just cast away darkness. Because of undying Meridia&#39;s hatred to all undead staff sets on fire all undead who was foolish enough to step into the light. Burning undead take 3 point of sun damage per second while stay in light of the staff. Staff will burn ANY undead no matter friendly or not. This is not side effect and not glitch, this is how it suppose to be.\r<br />You can find this item during [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/The_Break_of_Dawn]The Break of Dawn[/url] quest at 2nd level of [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Kilkreath_Temple]Kilkreath Ruins[/url]. If you already done this quest you can still go there and find it.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Installation:[/b]\r<br />Use NMM&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]Compatibility:[/b]\r<br />This is standalone item, so it is compatible with literally anything. From version 1.1 you need Dawnguard dlc.\r<br />\r<br />Your feedback is highly appreciated. If you noticed any issues or you just have an advice please let me know.",
