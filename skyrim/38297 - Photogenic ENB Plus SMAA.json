  "summary": "A natural ENB plus antaliasing with good performance, based on observations of real world lightings. No DOF just SSAO.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This ENB requires ENB 0.113 which has to be downloaded here:\r\n\r\nenbdev.com/enbseries_skyrim_v0113.zip\r\n\r\nPlease use only the d3d9.dll file in the zip, ALL other files are included in my file.\r\n\r\nPhotogenic ENB Plus SMAA is meant to be used with Realistic Lighting Overhaul 4.07 without weather.\r\nDO NOT use the RLO weather file for the moment! It is not finished yet.RLO can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30450//?\r\n\r\nPhotogenic ENB Plus SMAA is NOT adjusted to work with Climates of Tamriel.\r\nIt should work fine with Enhanced Lights and FX though.\r\n\r\nPlease disable ANY kind of antialising in the game and graphics card driver. This ENB comes with a\r\nvery nice antialiasing which causes almost no performance loss.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nINSTALL: Copy all files into your Skyrim folder, as usual. Also copy the ENB 0.113 d3d9.dll file.\r\nUNINSTALL: Remove all files you have copied.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTHE BACKGROUND STORY\r\n\r\nI sometimes eat in a restaurant with a very rustic medieval theme. There is timber, pelts and only candlelight and a large open fire in winter. It actually looks quite Iike the inns you find in Skyrim. I noticed candlelight is not all that red and super cozy. And it can lit a large room without any daylight much better than expected, if there are enough candles.\r\n\r\nI live in the countryside in the north of Germany and when I Iook outside there is nothing but nature and few rural buildings. I tried to come close to what I see with Photogenic ENB Plus SMAA.I started out with another ENB called \\\"Become Skyrim\\\" and worked on from there. I added SMAA and adjusted everything to Realistic Lighting Overhaul 4.07 with itÂ´s weather file.\r\n\r\nPERFORMANCE:\r\n\r\nI run a Quadcore Q9950 @2.883mgHz  with a ATI 6870 1 GB. I loose up to 10 frames and the SMAA does not seem to have any impact at all, which is cool.\r\n\r\nPLEASE KEEP IN MIND:\r\n\r\nThere is no way for me to estimate what Photogenic ENB Plus SMAA will look like on any other screen than my own, so your results may vary.\r\n\r\nCREDITS:\r\n\r\nCredits go to the authors of:\r\nBecome Skyrim\r\nRealistic Lighting Overhaul\r\nBoris Vorontsev for ENB\r\nWhoever invented the SMAA dll.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
