  "descriptionHtml": "Mehrunes\\' Tears is a master level spell which can cause a considerable number of fireballs to rain down from the sky onto whichever unlucky individual you choose.\r\n\r\nBy it\\'s very nature,  it can only be used outdoors and can cause a great deal of collateral damage when used near other people.\r\ndue to this unpredictable and destructive nature,  the spells attack can be cancelled by sheathing your weapon or lowering your hands.\r\n\r\nThe spell is not particularly accurate against moving enemies. the faster they run,  the less likely they are to be hit (sucks to be an archer then).\r\n\r\nThe spell can be learned by entering the shrine of Mehrunes Dagon. It\\'s right in front of the big chest, you can\\'t miss it.\r\n\r\nYou might want to equip some enchanted gear to reduce your destruction magic cost. it\\'s quite an expensive spell to cast (especially if you miss!)",
