  "descriptionHtml": "Daisho, wearing both a long and short sword has been historically the symbol and privilege of the samurai class.\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a wakizashi to the blades swords wearing postion.\r\n\r\nNote that the shoto is purely decorative, i.e. you can never draw it out even if you dual wield.\r\n\r\nP.S.: \r\nA more appropriate wearing form of the katana is with the edge side up, however currently (before the CK is out) I have no idea how to change the default wearing position this way.  Nevertheless, just assume what you are wearing is a TACHI, which is commonly seen in armored samurai anyway.",
