  "descriptionHtml": "For those whose silverware have a bluish hue, now they look like made from pure silver.\r\n\r\nManual Installation (Gopher\\'s way):\r\n\r\nGo to NMM and click on add mod from file (the puzzle bit with the plus sign button at the upper left corner). Find the folder where you\\'ve put the downloaded .rar file (preferably a SkyrimMods folder), click on it and then click Open. Then activate. Run the Installer of TESVSkyrim and then hit play.\r\nIf you have skse installed, rather than hit play, exit the installer and double click the skse.exe.\r\n\r\nThanks to bethesda for this epic game and to the release of the creation kit.\r\nThanks to all the modders who inspired me to start modding too,\r\nespecialy to Gopher whose method of installation of the compressed files in NMM has been a real lifesaver and also for the instructions of how to install the SKSE. All these are explained in his videos.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/38219\r\n\r\nPlease visit my other mods too. Don\\'t forget to endorse.\r\n",
