Maybe because it is high above skyrim and long forgotten. Mandale itself is segmented into different island´s. The Trading district, the living district, Faun and the mining district. Your journey starts in the trading district and will lead you to new locations all around Mandale´s islands. But be warned. Not everyone wants to be your friend. A new deadly enemy will await you on your journey......\r\n\r\n---------------NOTE--------------------------\r\nAt the moment, this is just a location test to see if you guys have problems with the mod like crashes or something. And of course to tell me what you think about it =) Let me know what you like/ dislike in the comments =)\r\n\r\nTo start your journey, look at the 3rd picture ^^\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdates will bring questline/npc´s/weapons/spells/ flying castle player home and much more =)\r\n\r\nThis is a huge project so updates will take long. Im almost done with the world itself and interiors. I want to give every place its own charm. And the fact that I still have to learn stuff like quest creation and npc behavior and such stuff will take some time too. ^^\r\n\r\n---------------Changelog---------------\r\n12.04.2013\r\n-Some asked me where the bandits come from. Well that is now solved. Created a whole new place called Thalea the bandit city. its a place where all the evil bandits from the mines come from. But dont worry: the people there wont attack you. They might be bandits, but the people who seek shelter will find a place there. Added some \\\"friendly\\\" bandits to give it some life =) You should still not talk too much to them. Sometimes they attack you O.o No idea why ^^ (pictures will follow)\r\n-Added a new \\\"secret\\\" merchant on faun. He will sell new spells to you. Currently non since I wasnt able to implement the first few spells but at least, he exists :D\r\n-Added some more flying isles around mandale/faun/Thalea to give it a more interesting look.\r\n\r\n13.02.2013\r\n-Added my first custom weapon. Others will be added soon.First, the scythe of the oracle. It will be a reward later, but for now, you can test it. You shouldnt drop it out of your inventory. No idea why, but this causes CTD =( Sry for that. \r\n\r\n24.01.2013\r\n-Navmesh on the second isle is now complete. I made it more companion friendly by adding\r\n more paths. ^^\r\n-Changed some portals for another look. Let me know about it in the comments.\r\n-Added the first kind of enemy: The Covenant Servant´s. Right now, their armor names arent\r\n modified etc. At the moment, its just for the look and their skill. Let me know if they are OP \r\n or something else (you find some of them in the fallen city)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[youtube]TGrC-DT9qls&feature=youtu.be[/youtube]\r\n\r\n---------------Credits---------------\r\n\r\n WiLLiSxD for doing his awesome video :3\r\n\r\n\r\n",
