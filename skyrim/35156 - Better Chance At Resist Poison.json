  "descriptionHtml": "In vanilla Skyrim the leveled list for a few enchanted necklaces are set so that you can only receive Resist Poison and Resist Disease at certain levels, then once you\\'ve gone past those levels you have no chance at getting them.\r\n\r\nThis fixes that. It makes that specific leveled list like every other leveled list in that it checks for levels at or below the player\\'s current level, allowing you to receive a Resist Poison necklace at levels 5 and up instead of only levels 5 and 15.\r\n\r\nResist Disease necklaces are also a part of this list, so now you have a chance to receive one at level 10+ instead of just level 10 and 20.\r\n\r\nThis also gives a better chance at getting a necklace of Water Breathing at Level 1+.",
