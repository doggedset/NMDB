  "descriptionHtml": "[u][b][size=5]FIRST TIMER[/size][/b][/u]\n<br />[size=4]This is my first mod so i'm hoping for a lot of feedback on what I did wrong if I did anything wrong. Any pointers on what I can do better would be vary much appreciated.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=5]Introduction\n<br />[/size][/u][/b][size=4]This is a little test mod I created, not much but I will do more attractive followers in the near future. \n<br />This is Melrose, she is a standalone dark elf that levels up as you progress through out Skyrim. she can be located at the drunken huntsman in Whiterun. Melrose does not have any weapons so i'm trusting you to equip her with the best of the best. Yes you can marry her ([/size]I wouldn't)[size=4] and she will stick by your side as you kill every soul in skyrim or pickpocket every single pocket you come across. She won't run from a fight no matter the odds and she is also essential.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5][u]Follower info\n<br />[/u][/size]Name:[/b] Melrose[b]\n<br />Race:[/b] Dark elf[b]\n<br />Age:[/b] 23[b]\n<br />Gender:[/b] Female[b]\n<br />Personality:[/b] Happy jolly soul[b]\n<br />Class:[/b] 1Handed Combat Warrior[b]\n<br />Combat style:[/b] Melee lv13 / she can use a bow  but she is better with one handed weapons[b]\n<br />Perks:[/b] Bladesman90 / Limbsplitter90 / Light Foot / She can take care of herself in battle but always watch her back[b]\n<br />Body Type:[/b] She uses vanilla body but because she is a standalone follower you can use any body you want.[b]\n<br />Location:[/b] The Drunken Huntsmen in Whiterun[b]\n<br />Marriable:[/b] Yes \n<br />[b]Health:[/b] 300[b] Stamina:[/b] 200[b] Magicka:[/b] 50\n<br />[b]Equipment:[/b] She is not equipped with a weapon but she is equipped with a full set of Draugr armor\n<br />[b]Dialogue:[/b] She uses the default follower dialogue\n<br />\"follow me, I need your help\"\n<br />\"wait here\"\n<br />\"I need you to do something\"\n<br />etc. \n<br />[b]Crimes:[/b] She will commit any crime with you no matter how awful.\n<br />[b]Weight:[/b] 100\n<br />\n<br />[/size][b][u][size=5]Test / Compatibility[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />[size=4]There shouldn't be any bugs, I haven't tested it with every mod on the nexus but it works fine with UFO, CBBE, UNP body, XPMS, BBP/TBBP. she should be compatible with pretty much any body and face retextures and follower overhauls.\n<br />If there are any bugs report them to me and i'll get on it as soon as possible.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b][u]Requirements\n<br />[/u][/b][/size]The only requirements are Skyrim v1.9.32.0.8 or higher and SKSE 1.7.3 or higher\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b][u]Installing\n<br />[/u][size=4]Mod Manager install: [/size][/b][/size][/size][size=4]You can download this mod with NMM or another mod manager.\n<br />[b]Manual install:[/b] Download and extract the mod into your skyrim data folder.
