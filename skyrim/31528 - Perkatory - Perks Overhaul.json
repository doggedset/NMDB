Should be more balanced since many of the big bonus skills usually have even bigger penalties making you wonder twice as much if you should get the perk or not, making every decision much more difficult. Also i really think that Speech is a pathetic tree so i had to change it, maintaining the perks but also making it more of a specialization tree.\r\n\r\nSince i started working for myself i ended up changing and revamping a lot of things and hopefully you will enjoy it to. I dont have Dragonborn so its only Dawnguard friendly.\r\n\r\nThanks to MTichenor for SkyRealism and his other mods.\r\n\r\nCodes:\r\n\r\n[color=red]Red - Version number for latest change[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=yellow]Yellow - Skill tree[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=blue]Blue - New tree[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=green]Green - New perks[/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=#ffff00]Light Armor[/color] - Switch gap between levels (there was no level 60 skill) renamed Skills and adjusted values of bonuses.\r\n\r\n[color=#ffff00]One hand[/color] - Renamed skills, tweaked bonuses, removed Paralyzing strike, renamed it Overkill, double crit damage, added blood frenzy double power attack damage.\r\n\r\n[color=#ffff00]Heavy Armor[/color] - Renamed skills, now heavy armor doesnt protect as much as light armor against falls, has the same elemental protection that light armor has, tower of might (judgement) deals 25% more stagger and not 50%. \r\n\r\n[color=#ffff00]Marksman[/color] - Improved design, changed skills, Marksman has 11 skills to match one hand and two hand, renamed skills, Quickshot now has 2 levels to make it more fun to level up, new perk Lacerate lvl1 - 10 damage for 10 sec, changed bonuses.\r\n\r\n[color=#ffff00]Two hand[/color] - Renamed skills (not all users of 2h are barbarians), tweaked bonuses, added [color=green]Death Wish[/color] - power forward critical stirke that does triple damage but gives triple that damage back at you.
