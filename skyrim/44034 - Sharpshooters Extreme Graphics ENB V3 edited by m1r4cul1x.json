Most people just pick another ENB or stop using the named mods, although they greatly increase immersion. \r\n\r\nBut if you just don\\'t want to waive them AND the clear and sharp immersion of a Sharpshooter ENB, then you start manipulating the enbseries.ini on your own. That mostly ends with many wasted hours and only little or none of the wished effect, frustration though. I went down that path myself several times. [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/41414/?/]One solution I found on Nexus[/url] was a manipulated Sharpshooter ENB , which basicly just increased AmbientLighting and Brightness to an extent that the shadows very well turned transparent again instead of the dead dark deepness they were before. \r\n\r\nBut the clarity and sharpness in the carefully adjusted Sharpshooter ENB just drowned in blending light, too much saturation and cheesy colours. The problem, but also the greatness of ENB comes from its possibility to reach a goal in many different ways. That means that if you adjust a few values, as AmbientLighting/DirectLighting etc., you also have to patiently adjust and test most of the other values to keep a sharp and clear look. \r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]THE SOLUTION[/color][/b]\r\nLong story short, I think I managed resolving the too dark shadows and keeping the Sharpshooter look. Additionally I did the ENB seperation in enbseries. ini and enblocal.ini to the Sharpshooter V3, which is done in ENB 0.227. I also slightly mindered saturation to make the overall look a bit more realistic, but without killing the Sharpshooter-WOW-effect. \r\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]PERFORMANCE & ADJUSTMENT![/color][/b]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Shift + Enter (opens enb settings ingame for live adjustments) \r\n[*]Shift +  F12 [turns it off/on] \r\n[*]Shift + * (turns on a fps counter)  \r\n[/list]\r\nOf course you can also use a Text Editor, however that\\'s way more complicated. \r\n\r\n[b]In case the performance sucks for you, turn off these under [u]effects[/u][/b]:\r\n[code]EnableAmbientOcclusion[/code] (can give you 5-10fps boost and doesn\\'t change the overall appearance that much)\r\n[code]EnableDepthOfField[/code] (performance boost is not that strong - 1-2fps - wouldn\\'t turn it off, because it has a major effect on the appearance)\r\n\r\n[b]Or you can try experimenting with the [u]antialising[/u] in the \\\"Global\\\" window above all the other settings (you have to scroll down, till antialising):[/b]\r\n[code]EnableEdgeAA\r\nEnableTemporalAA \r\nEnableSubPixelAA\r\nEnableTransparencyAA[/code]\r\n\r\n[b]In case You want/have to adjust this setting further the key terms are:[/b] \r\n[list]\r\n[*][code]SKYLIGHTING[/code] (Not really used by sharpshooter, although it is the problem solver for the shadows.
