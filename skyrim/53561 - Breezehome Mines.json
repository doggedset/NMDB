  "descriptionHtml": "COPIED FROM STEAM WORKSHOP 4/28/2014:\r<br />http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=9276&tscn=1398701022\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds mines to your house in Breezehome. There are 4 veins of each type and I have also added in a smelter, furnace, armor bench, sharpening wheel, enchanting table, and more. Also 3 chests added in the mines for you to store anything you wish. There is also a dwarven dresser which replenishes dwarven items for smelting and a wooden dresser that replenishes 12 of each ingot. There has also been an addition of an alchemy section that contains a chest full of ingredients that replenishes. The pull chain is what replenishes all the containers and resets things that are out of place(i.e. fallen torches). \r<br />\r<br />NOTE: Any chests/dressers that contain items (i.e. the dwarven dresser, ingot dresser, and alchemt chest) respawn so DO NOT use them for storage or you may lose your items. \r<br />\r<br />---Current Patches--- \r<br />1. Work on pull chain resetting the ores. \r<br />\r<br />---Possible Updates--- \r<br />1. Blacksmith apron \r<br />2. Mannequins \r<br />3. Re-locking chests \r<br />\r<br />---Latest Revision--- \r<br />1. Removed insects. \r<br />\r<br />I would prefer comments be made on Steam Workshop, since that is most likely to be seen by me.",
