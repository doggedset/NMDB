  "descriptionHtml": "DESCRIPTION:\r<br />\r<br />You may purchase a kit from certain disreputable merchants and use it to mutilate yourself -- I mean, change your appearance. It shares the same limits as Dawnguard’s face sculptor, though this toy can be used by vampires (you’ll change your human appearance and then revert back to a vampire, so you may change hair and things).\r<br />\r<br />After use, you’ll run the risk of disease, because for heaven’s sakes, do you even know where those knives have been?\r<br />\r<br />Sold by Babette and Thieves Guild fences, for the modest fee of 1000 gold, adjusted by your speech skill. Characters looking to avoid criminal entanglements should look to Enthir at the College of Winterhold, though he’s a tough sell.\r<br />\r<br />To use, attempt to equip the kit in your inventory.\r<br />\r<br />REQUIREMENTS:\r<br />\r<br />A working copy of the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />\r<br />Place the contents of the .7z file in your &#34;Data&#34; folder, which is usually located under Steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />The ReadMe document and the .bsl file are not required for the mod to run -- you may keep them or discard them.\r<br />\r<br />UNINSTALLATION:\r<br />\r<br />Delete the included .esp and .bsa file.\r<br />\r<br />The nature of Skyrim’s scripting language, Papyrus, means that, even following this procedure, your Papyrus log will continue to throw errors about missing scripts, potentially leading to save game bloat. There is, lamentably, nothing that I can do about this -- you have been warned.\r<br />\r<br />UPDATING:\r<br />\r<br />Replace all older files with newer versions. If in doubt, replace all mod files with the contents of the latest uploaded archive.\r<br />\r<br />No in-game configuration is necessary.\r<br />\r<br />BUGS:\r<br />\r<br />As of yet, none.\r<br />\r<br />COMPATIBILITY:\r<br />\r<br />This should be compatible with practically any mod.",
