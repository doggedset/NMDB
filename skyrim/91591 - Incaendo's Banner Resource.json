  "descriptionHtml": "This modders resource contains 59 new banners with their own textures and .nif files. \n<br />\n<br />The designs are varied and include bandit-theme, medieval Hungarian patterns, spell school icons, flat colors, simple cloth and other things.\n<br />\n<br />Based on the genericbannerred01.nif file so they are animated with the lowest amount of wind. If you need the variants with more wind then you can always copy one of the other genericbanner nifs and change the textures to one of these. Decided not to do all variants for this modders resource since I see it as a lot of work for more niche situations in which case you can do those yourself. \n<br />\n<br />Remember to place into MovableStatic to get animations!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Will likely make more in the future and update the files on this page so in case you are interested in this kind of thing then remember to check back every now and then.",
