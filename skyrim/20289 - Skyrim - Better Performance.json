  "descriptionHtml": "This mod makes your Skyrim way faster and let\\'s you gain between 5-20 FPS more!\r\nit is just an d9d3.dll file that you need to copy into your skyrim folder (not Data!) I recommend this mod for people who have low quality PC\\'s or Labtops. what this ddl.file does is making run your skyrim way smoother and with lo lagg, you will also gain more frames per second. i\\'m making a video of it and put up some gameplay! \r\n\r\nNOTE: It isn\\'t compatible with ENB Mods like Sharpshooters!\r\n\r\nMy Graphics adapter is an NVIDIA Geforce 8800 GS, and it works perfectly! i have no lagg more FPS and it runs smooth as hell!\r\n\r\nIf you dont trust this ddl.file you can make a backup of your own ddl.file and try this one out. \r\n\r\ni\\'ve added some gameplay and a tutorial!",
