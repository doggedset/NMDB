  "summary": "Changes the Quickshot perk to almost double speed of what it was in vanilla. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "I made this mod for archers who wanted to rain down arrows or for people who thought there was no longer a reason to use bows with crossbows having high damage and 100% stagger rate with power shot. \r\nThis effectively doubles Bow DPS and might be suitable for some archers who play with difficulty mods but don\\'t want an archery overhaul mod.  \r\nThis mod doubles the bow draw speed bonus the perk Quick Shot gives to around double of normal bow draw speed. \r\nTL;DR Makes you shoot arrows fast. \r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t notice a change in bow draw speed on installation type help \\\"quick shot\\\" 4 then player.removeperk (quickshot ID) then type player.addperk (quickshot ID) it should fix it.
