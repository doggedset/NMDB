  "summary": "STANDALONE set of retextured heavy daedric armor and weapons. For now comes in green, cyan, and purple. The armor&#39;s stats are ever so slightly better than vanilla daedrics. The weapons have the same damage as dragon weapons (meaning slightly higher than vanilla daedric) and make for good replacements over the ugly dragon weapons. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "Rexturing done by Vidoegame. I simply edited the values in the Creation Kit to tweak the stats and upload them to Nexus, whereas they were previously only available on Steam (In the Steam version the armor keeps the same stats as vanilla daedric). \r<br />\r<br />STANDALONE set of retextured heavy daedric armor and weapons. Comes in GREEN, CYAN, and PURPLE. Because these are standalone you can install all the colors at once and give each of your followers a different color, etc. The armor&#39;s stats are ever so slightly better than vanilla daedric to make it comparable to dragonplate. The weapons have the same damage as dragon weapons (meaning slightly higher than vanilla daedric) and make for good replacements over the ugly dragon weapons. Fully craftable, upgradeable, and enchantable.\r<br />\r<br />Fully compatible with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9286/?]T3nd0s Skyrim Redone[/url]﻿ because the armor is tagged/classified as daedric still, so the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28467/?tab=1&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D28467%26preview%3D&pUp=1]ReProccer[/url]﻿ will assign all the new weapons/armor pieces from this mod the same stats as the normal daedric that was already in your game.\r<br />\r<br />Steam link to green: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=95496089\r<br />Steam link to cyan: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=93154359\r<br />Steam link to purple: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=96181115\r<br />\r<br />[b]NOTE: When crafting this armor, the new texture will not appear until you have actually made the armor, you&#39;ll see the vanilla texture in the crafting window until you actually make it. The appearance of the armor in the menu does not represent how it actually looks when worn. [/b]",
