  "summary": "This mod adds a few new bosses to skyrim for those who&#39;ve just gotten bored with the game&#39;s easiness. If your like me then your probably bored after the last million times your god-like character took out the ebony warrior in one hit, if so this is the mod for you&#33;",
  "descriptionHtml": "WARNING: This mod is in early alpha, so I&#39;m still working on most of the bosses. Currently has four bosses available.\r<br />\r<br />I need player&#39;s to help testing the bosses combat abilities, epicness, and overall enjoyability to fight before I start adding the hard stuff like custom models and textures, so any help is appreciated. Leave comments as you see fit(I&#39;ll just ignore the ones that have nothing constructive to say).\r<br />\r<br />The first boss is my spinoff of the Ebony Warrior(because he was my favorite boss before discovering mods): you&#39;ll find him behind High Hrothgar in the courtyard. He has unique armor built specifically to take as much damage as possible and cause a distraction if he&#39;s wounded, he has two defensive spells(grand healing and dragonrage, a custom spell by me I&#39;m not shure whether I&#39;ll make playable or not) and many offensive spells and shout to Knock away the player and your allies if you try to gangbang him, and lastly he has a good stock of potions in case you knock him down and he can&#39;t access his spells.\r<br />\r<br />The second Boss is called Fenris,an giant wolf with the ability to control frost and thunder. He lies deep in the Whiterun tundra, I recommend armor with strong resists to frost and shock or you&#39;ll be in for a world of hurt(I&#39;ll be adding the ability to summon werewolf followers to him soon).\r<br />\r<br />The third boss is the Grand Lych, A dragonpriest with the ability to steal others life forces and make copies of himself when wounded. Pro Tip: kill the first copy he summons unless you want to fight up to seven of the guys.\r<br />\r<br />The latest fourth boss is the Drakolych, A dragon with necromantic powers. He is located at the serpent stone so that he doesn&#39;t kill anyone important.\r<br />\r<br />good luck.\r<br />If your having trouble see below for strategies to help:\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If your a melee fighter, I HIGHLY recommend working up your block skill and magic resistance, his sword is enchanted to ignore armor so you might as well fight him in tin foil if your a coward who relies on stats(NOTE: Dragonhide is your best friend), and he has multiple &#34;push and paralyze&#34; spells so &#34;block well and often&#34; and Magic resistance=LIVING.\r<br />\r<br />If your an archer, use crossbows(especially ones that pierce armor, as his armor is custom it remains un effected by mods like skyre, so his armor rating rises above the vanilla armor cap for those who use such mods). I also using an enchantment that is not paralysis, fire, frost, or shock based, you can probably guess why.\r<br />\r<br />If your a mage, use any summoning spell you have and Dragonhide(if you have it). To avoid players trying to wimp out with some bull tactic I basically had to wrap him in Bull**** proof armor. If this proves to be frustrating to mages and rogues, I apologize.\r<br />\r<br />If you a rogue with little to no armor but is good at sneak attacks, I&#39;ve got nothing. He&#39;s invisible if he doesn&#39;t detect you because I want to avoid people using there super mega ultra on-hit-kill sneak attacks to avoid fighting him(if your going to pull that this isn&#39;t the mod for you). If you were just intending to sneak up and do a sneak attack to take a good bit of his health so you could have a quick mono-a-mono slamdown before he could heal, again I apologize.\r<br />\r<br />I must also recommend falskaar as there is an enchantment from that mod that allows you to keep enemies from healing themselves, this is to give you an edge in battle and stop a peculiar AI glitch where if an NPC  takes to much damage per second while they have any amount of potions in their inventory, they&#39;ll start spamming them like there&#39;s no tomorrow(I have no idea how to fix this, so if this happens just think of it as the games revenge for the times you&#39;ve done it).
