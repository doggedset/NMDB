  "descriptionHtml": "Please keep in mind this is my first attempt at making something craftable.\r<br />\r<br />I felt that a shield looked ridiculous on my assassin, so I created a few sets of gauntlets that also take up the shield slot. They have stats a little less than the shield of their sets (I might release my OP speed run version in the future)\r<br />\r<br />Shield-gauntlets are craftable at the Skyforge with a set of gauntlets and a shield from the set (meaning dragonplate shield-gauntlets need dragonplate gauntlets and a dragonplate shield etc.) and require their respective perks. A few sets didn&#39;t have a shield, so I tried to pair it with something semi-lore friendly.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve also added them to the test cell, and a few sets can be found in the hold capitals (for lazy people who don&#39;t feel like making them).\r<br />\r<br />All items are temperable and enchantable.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ll try to release an update to include stalhrim, but right now CC is being an a&#036;&#036; and not letting me open Dragonborn. Let me know if you think I should add anything to it.",
