  "descriptionHtml": "Powerful Deity are roaming around Skyrim, but they are out of there place of Origin...which means they can be killed....But they are Hard to kill.\r<br />\r<br />This isn&#39;t a Quest-line\r<br />\r<br />Story:- The First Deity that crossed the Barriers of Tamriel, was the Goddess of Magic in Greek Mythology, She was the First to cross the Barrier but she isn&#39;t aggressive towards everybody, but then she bought Ares the God of War, who Loves killing everything he can lay his eyes on.\r<br />\r<br />These Immortals can be killed when they are in Tamriel.\r<br />Since these Immortals are also called &#34;Gods&#34; they also have Ability&#39;s that not only Even to Alduins strength...but exceed Alduins strength by a tenfold.\r<br />\r<br />There is Currently no sort of Weapon or Spell Known to Skyrim that can Kill these Gods because...they aren&#39;t a problem yet.\r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />\r<br />Ok, this isn&#39;t the most &#34;Lore-Friendly&#34; mod ever made, you have to have a Protagonist that has done All that he can in Skyrim to face any one of the Immortals. You either need a Totally Maxed protagonist or exploit the Restoration loop.\r<br />\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />\r<br />Details on the Current Immortals\r<br />\r<br />Hecate:- Mage that uses Thunderbolt in both hands, when he gets weak (Around 300 hp left) he uses Grand healing (But heals about 800 hp). She isn&#39;t too difficult to kill if you have all of the Alteration Perks for Magic defense and Magic resistant armor.\r<br />NOTE:- You cannot beat her with magic she is quite resistant. Found in Pelagius Wing in the Blue Palace. Her corpse gives you a Dragonskin spell that is castable in one hand that lasts for 5 minutes. \r<br />\r<br />Ares:- 2-Handed battle axe user that is Totally immune to Magic, and does extreme melee damage, he is Stronger then Hecate, He is also aggressive and will run after you, Basically if you get in Melee range without Heavy armor your dead. He is difficult to kill with Melee but Impossible with magic, You can use Dragonskin to make 80% his attacks weaker, it will save you. Or you could try Archer build...But if he gets close your dead.\r<br />NOTES\r<br />\r<br />Continued story: Since the Barriers are breaking because there is already 2 Immortals in Tamriel the barriers are Cracked. But not just Greek Gods are trying to get through there are Norse gods, Christan Deitys, Jewish Deitys, Roman Gods, Pagan Gods and perhaps even more then i can say...but Ares is the start\r<br />\r<br />UPDATE: When you find a Deity they have a Book that tells you who the Next Deity will be\r<br />UPDATE: New Deity. Read the note on Hecate or Find him.\r<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r<br />\r<br />About myself and why i made this mod:- Because iv hit Level 500 in Skyrim (Legendary version of course) and I&#39;m Bored out of my mind because the Deity s or &#34;Daedra&#34; if you prefer, aren&#39;t what i expected. Every Religion in the world has a Branch to it that leads to Fighting. In Greek mythology, the Gods where like people, with flaws and personality etc. The Christians had Angles who were not all about Saving people, the book of Revelations say they were warriors to Combat the Apocalypse. So in that type of believe, The Gods in Skyrim were quite useless (Other then Chief of Devines and Lord of Domination).\r<br />\r<br />Send me a Message if you think what i said was Offensive in any way, or Send me a request to put a certain God/Deity in the mod.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy \r<br />\r<br />Final Note: Some Deitys are easy to kill in certain play styles (Like Mage) but others are Impossible to kill with that play style as well.",
