  "descriptionHtml": "GLADIUS - IMPERIAL SWORD RETEXTURE 1.1\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\nI wasn\\'t much satisfied with the vanilla texture of the Imperial Sword and other retextures looked a bit too fanciful for my tastes, so I took some pictures of gladii replicas and of a couple of original Roman daggers (pugio)\r\nand I\\'ve tried to make a texture with Photoshop. After many hours of work I\\'m still not completely satisfied with it, but I think it\\'s the best I could do....\r\n\r\nAfter making some thoughts, I\\'ve chosen to take example from the Caucasian kinjals to further improve the texture...after all, they were thrusting weapons and a gladius was a short thrusting sword,\r\nmoreover the shape of some kinjals were quite similar to the shape of the original vanilla texture. Currently the only issue (which is unsolvable for my technical skills, however) I see with this sword \r\nretexture is the non-seamless connection between the point and the main blade, which was improved from the previous version, but still isn\\'t seamless!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVERSION\r\n\r\n1.0\t\t\tMy first attempt to retexture the Imperial Sword. This was based on gladii replicas and original Roman daggers (pugio) taken from the web, which were photomixed with Photoshop.\r\n1.1\t\t\tSecond attempt to retexture the Imperial Sword. The original retexture has been changed with elements taken from pictures of modern Caucasian kinjals, which, from my point of view,\r\n                                                        seemed quite similar in shape to the original gladius (of which, however, few authentic swords are survived).\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\nUnzip the textures folder into your Data folder.\r\n\r\nUNINSTALLATION\r\nDelete the content of the directory \\\"textures\\\\weapons\\\\imperial\\\" from your Data folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE FOR ANYONE INTERESTED\r\nAs long as you put me into your credits, feel free to take, modify and cannibalize this texture without need for authorization.\r\n\r\nCREDITS\r\n\r\nThank to the user Macp1337 for suggesting me that the retexture could be improved a little bit.",
