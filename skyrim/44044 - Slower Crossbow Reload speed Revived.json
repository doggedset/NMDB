  "descriptionHtml": "This is my second attempt of making a mod so be gentle if I mess-up as horribly as the last time.\r\nI feel that in vanilla skyrim Crossbows were just a better version of bows, I for one do not like this so, I decided to make them reload slower and decrease there range by a bit. I realize it looks a bit off because the arm seems to go in a slower type motion but Im a nooby moder so If anyone knows of some sort of fix let me know!",
