  "descriptionHtml": "Changes the Imperial racial ability \\\"Voice of the Emperor\\\" to a +10 Speech skill bonus upon character creation.\r\n\r\nAll of my characters are Imperial for the gold perk and aesthetic reasons, but I think VotE is worthless. I think the +10 Speech fits the spirit of the Imperial racial bonuses, and is more useful.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER, PLEASE READ: The +10 Speech bonus WILL NOT show up on characters that have already been created, although it will remove VotE. It WILL show up on characters newly created after this mod is installed. (This is due to the way racial skill bonuses are calculated- the racial bonuses are added to the skill value variable upon character creation, and are not referred to after that.)\r\n\r\nSOLUTION: To add the +10 Speech bonus to a character already created, open the console with the ~ key and type \\\"player.setav speech 50\\\", with the number being 10 points higher than your current Speech skill.\r\n\r\nVersion: 1.0\r\nAuthor: WarriorG0el\r\n\r\nI love clear feedback, good or bad! Let me know if there\\'s anything else you\\'d like to see in this mod, or any bugs that I can fix.\r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n\r\n1.0 (Release) - Removed Voice of the Emperor ability for Imperial player characters. Added a +10 Speech bonus to new Imperial player characters - existing characters must add the bonus manually. \r\n\r\nThanks very much!\r\n\r\nOther WG Mods:\r\n\r\nItem Rewards For Bounties:  Adds a random leveled item as a reward upon quest completion, and changes bounty rewards to 250 gold for Bandits/Forsworn, 500 gold for Giants and 750 gold for dragons. \r\n\r\nUndying Companions: Makes all companions essential, meaning they cannot die by friendly or hostile damage. Exceptions: Erandur, Cicero and Eola.\r\n\r\nBreezehome Enchanting Table - Adds an enchanting table to Breezehome right next to the Alchemy Lab. Will only show up once Alchemy Lab decoration is purchased from Proventus in Dragonsreach. Mood lighting included.\r\n\r\nEnhanced Alchemy XP - Slightly increases Alchemy XP gain rate (20%) to balance with other skills such as Smithing. Still balanced, more fun.\r\n\r\nGIANT Animals - Makes all animals, plus trolls, 3x bigger than normal. Just subscribe and walk around Skyrim - it\\'s GREAT for kicks.\r\n\r\nVisible Slaughterfish - Makes only slaughterfish 3x bigger so you can see them more easily.\r\n\r\nEvil Slaughterfish - Makes slaughterfish much more dangerous: 3x damage, 2.5x speed, 3.1x attack chance and 2x health.\r\n\r\nSkyscraper Giants - Makes giants 3x bigger.\r\n\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/WarriorG0el/myworkshopfiles/",
