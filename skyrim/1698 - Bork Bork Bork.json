  "descriptionHtml": "This isn\\'t a serious mod, for those of you wondering. I mostly made it for shits and giggles. Um de hur de hur de hur!\r\nIt simply replaces a bunch of language strings in Skyrim to make most of the interface Swedish Chef style, from The Muppets.\r\nI didn\\'t do the transcription; all credit goes to the folks at http://www.rinkworks.com/ for their \\'Dialectizer\\'.\r\n\r\nTO INSTALL:\r\nSimply extract the contents of the RAR archive to the Skyrim folder, usually under \\\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\\\\".\r\nYou may want to backup the file \\\"Translate_ENGLISH.txt\\\", as this contains the default menu strings. There is a backup included in the archive, however, just in case.\r\n\r\nTO UNINSTALL:\r\nGo to the Data\\\\Interface directory in your Skyrim folder as mentioned above, and rename or delete \\\"Translate_ENGLISH.txt\\\".\r\nThen, rename \\\"Translate_ENGLISH_original.txt\\\" to \\\"Translate_ENGLISH.txt\\\", and voil√°. Or, if you like, you can use your own backup.\r\nDO NOT run the game without one of these files, not unless you want every string of words to begin with a $.\r\n\r\nFeel free to modify the files as you like. I don\\'t hold any copyrights on this work.",
