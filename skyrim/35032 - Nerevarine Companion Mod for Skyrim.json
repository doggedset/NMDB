  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=100][img]http://i.imgur.com/7wKterl.jpg[/img][/size][/center]\r<br />\r<br />INTRODUCTION:\r<br />As some of you may know I am the modder for &#34;Companion Ria Revised&#34;, &#34;Sovngarde Heroes&#34; and &#34;Arweden&#34;. I announced a while ago that I was (well AM) working on a third companion mod, revealing it to be none other than the Nerevarine. Due to my extremely busy schedule and delays due to a series of unfortunate events (like losing contact with my voice actress and losing a lot of sound files) the update for Arweden will be delayed until further notice. To make up for the delays I have decided to release the Nerevarine Companion Mod as it is, just to get it out there. It features fully voiced intro dialogue and SOME location aware (Solstheim only) dialogue. Obviously this will be expanded on when I have the time. &#34;Arweden&#34; is still a priority but this will definitely be updated.\r<br />\r<br />BUGS:\r<br />- None as I&#39;m aware of except for the outfit issue as of V1.03 which I&#39;ll get to shortly. No voice in most of his dialogue since they are yet to be attached to the appropriate dialogue. Silent voice files are in place to prevent dialogue skipping.\r<br />\r<br />- The Nerevarine&#39;s default outfit has changed though won&#39;t show up and still wear his bonemold armor. Assuming you don&#39;t have any third party follower mods... this is the only way I know to update it. If you really don&#39;t care then forget this step.\r<br />\r<br />1) Collect everything that you gave him from his inventory\r<br />2) Dismiss and wait for an hour\r<br />3) Exit Skyrim and unload the mod\r<br />4) Open save file, fast travel to an interior cell and SAVE\r<br />5) Activate mod again and play\r<br />\r<br />You really don&#39;t have to enter an interior cell but its a precaution, I myself am very careful when uninstalling mods as really.. because of the way Skyrim is, choosing mods carefully is vital&#33; I think UFO allows the player to change the default outfit.. I have not tested this feature.\r<br />\r<br />ABOUT THE NEREVARINE:\r<br />The Nerevarine is your character in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, the prophecied incarnate, the reincarnation of Saint Nerevar, a legendary Chimer figure. Champion of Azura, the Nerevarine fufilled the prophecies by ending the Blight, destroying Dagoth Ur and heralded the end of the Tribunal era. After many adventures the Nerevarine, likely weary from his travels across Morrowind and Tamriel, journeyed to Akavir. Never to be seen again... Until... Now. Or at least &#34;this version (my version)&#34; of the Nerevarine. (If he/she&#39;s dead in your &#34;Elder Scrolls world&#34; I don&#39;t suggest you download this..).\r<br />\r<br />The Nerevarine has returned, hear his story in the Temple at Raven Rock.\r<br />\r<br />* Partially voiced, future dialogue will be fully voiced. So far silent voice files serve as placeholders as to avoid dialogue skipping.\r<br />\r<br />* The Nerevarine could have been any race, and either gender. My personal explanation will be included within the Nerevarine&#39;s dialogue once I&#39;ve added it in. He is implied to be Dunmer though.\r<br />\r<br />* The Nerevarine is powerful... but for game balancing sake he&#39;s not a full demi-god... (yet). He still has his burnt out blade Trueflame (which you will not be able to grab) and is essential. He even has his Moon and Star ring though you also cannot use it (well you&#39;ll probably die if you tried to)\r<br />\r<br />* The Nerevarine also has a recall spell you can learn from a spell tome of which you can access via his inventory.\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION: REQUIRES DRAGONBORN\r<br />Unpack and drop to data files. Those using V1.02 or below will have to reinstall the mod for the Nerevarine to use his new default outfit. If you don&#39;t care. The nevermind.\r<br />\r<br />FUTURE PLANS AND DIRECTIONS\r<br />- More dialogue\r<br />- Voice all current dialogue\r<br />- Update this main page when I have more time&#33;&#33;\r<br />- Quests\r<br />- Possibly add changes to his face aesthetics\r<br />\r<br />CURRENT + FUTURE PLANS/PROGRESS\r<br />\r<br />V2.0\r<br />- Feature all voiced dialogue so far\r<br />- the Nerevarine&#39;s first quest which has been planned out\r<br />- More balancing tweaks\r<br />\r<br />VERSIONS LOG\r<br />\r<br />V1.03 - Added a Journal. You will have access to the Nerevarine&#39;s journal which includes all the main quest entries. Trueflame (improved/new model) and Hopesfire and changed the default outfit into the Indoril/Ordinator armor\r<br />\r<br />V1.02 - More silent voice files to prevent dialogue skipping, also made changes to the Nerevarine&#39;s appearance.\r<br />\r<br />V1.01 - Updated with silent voice files to avoid dialogue skipping, also released a loose file version as an option\r<br />\r<br />V1.0 - Initial Release\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS\r<br />Author of Mod - Me\r<br />Moon and Star Ring - PrivateEye (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13220/?)\r<br />Voice of the Nerevarine - Me\r<br />Nerevarine&#39;s Journal Entries - EndgameV (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35087/?)\r<br />Trueflame and  Hopesfire - ArdenDanmer (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47249/?)\r<br />Ordinator Armor - Natterforme (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26720/?)",
