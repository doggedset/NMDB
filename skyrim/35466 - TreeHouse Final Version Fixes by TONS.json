  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg612/KaizMK/TONSpresents.jpg[/img]\r\n[b][size=5]Fixes for the Final Version of the Treehouse by meowmixyum[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nalso check out:\r\n\r\n[b][size=3][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35468/]Treehouse TONS Edition[/url][/size][/b][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[u][size=5][b]INTRODUCTION[/b][/size][/u] (feel free to skip this part as there is no useful info here)\r\n\r\nIn all my searching for a player abode, I saw a lot of good ones and even a few greats, but I have very specific tastes and whatnots and basically only ended up with two of them.\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12084/]The Treehouse Final Version by meowmixyum[/url] was one of them and I loved this house, but I ran into a few issues and thought others might have had the same or similar problems so I tried to fix them.\r\n\r\nI don\\'t know what I\\'m doing. I can\\'t read or write. I thought the word \\\"mod\\\" was short for modem and was wondering why everyone was making modems for Skyrim when they didn\\'t have the internet back then.\r\n\r\nBut I tried to do this anyway. Keep that in mind when you tell me stuff that is wrong  because I will try to fix it but there is like a 137% chance that I will not only crash Skyrim trying to fix it but also the entire WWW.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[u][size=5][b]ATTEMPTED FIXES[/b][/size][/u]\r\n\r\n - [color=red]Mannequins kept trying to run for the border[/color]... now they just creep you out if you go to the Treehouse without using a load door to go to an interior and then come back out to Skyrim [u]BEFORE[/u] heading to the Treehouse\r\n\r\n - [color=red]Followers were afraid of the wood monster that lived in your closet and the boogey dragon that lived under your bed[/color]... but now they will actually enter your house and follow you around in it... for the most part. I can\\'t guarantee this will work all the time as I still had issues with this sometimes, but it has the potential to work whereas before it didn\\'t. [b][i]In short, I crappily added Navmesh. I tried my best, but navmeshing sucks to do and I suck at doing it[/i][/b]\r\n\r\n - [color=red]Robbing bandits wasn\\'t fun, because I couldn\\'t show off their stuff[/color]... sure you could maneuver things into a display case but if you\\'re , mentally faulty like myself and thus struggle with coordination that just wasn\\'t going to work out so now all the display cases activate and will put the stuff int here for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[u][size=5][b]WHAT YOU NEED[/b][/size][/u]\r\n\r\n - [color=red]An abacus[/color]... not really, but it is a neat word and a neat object so I said you would need one.\r\n\r\n - [color=red]Only this file[/color]... so don\\'t use both this and the other one, just pick one. I wanted it to need the original [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12084/]Treehouse Final Version[/url], but I didn\\'t know how to do that and everything I tried to make it that way ended with despair and then nachos.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[u][size=5][b]SOME KNOWN ISSUES[/b][/size][/u]\r\n\r\n - [color=red]THA STAIRS![/color]... It bothers me that when I got to run up them, Casper the A-hole Ghost and his friends get in the way (invisible things stop me momentarily) making what should be a straight and smooth run up the stairs very stuttered. I have no idea how to fix that so if anyone else does, drop me a line or 4.\r\n\r\n - [color=red]When using an optional file or two, sometimes Skyrim makes the Treehouse have babies[/color]... Most of the time I don\\'t have this issue but on occasion the Treehouse gets doubled on top of itself. [color=gold]I\\'m not sure if you have to do all this to fix it, but I restart Skyrim and that works for me.[/color]\r\n\r\n - [color=red]If you wait around in the same area as the Treehouse, the mannequins may try to escape again and end up in weird places[/color]... loading through an interior and coming back fixes this for me as well when it does happen.\r\n\r\n - [color=red]Being a crash dummy[/color]... is best for dummies and that person that annoys you at work (you know the one), not for Skyrim. This mod (and the one this is based on) has never caused my computer to CTD, but I guess anything is possible. If this causes you to crash, let me know, but honestly, I will not know what to do. I\\'ll probably just panic for eleventy mails and that prolly won\\'t help you much.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[u][size=5][b]UPDATES[/b][/size][/u]\r\n\r\n  If I ever have any or if I come up with any good \\\"Yo Momma\\\" jokes, I will put them here.\r\n\r\n[i]*Disclaimer: I will not be posting \\\"Yo Momma\\\" jokes of any kind*[/i]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[u][size=5][b]CREDIT[/b][/size][/u]\r\n\r\n- Obviously meowmixyum, for making such a great player home and then giving me permission to work on it.\r\n\r\n- Bethesda for making Skyrim\r\n\r\n",
