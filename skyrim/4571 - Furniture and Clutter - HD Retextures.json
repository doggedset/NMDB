I tried to create high detailed retextures while staying as close as possible to the original. \r\nHere a list of the retextures:\r\n\r\n- A lot of wooden furniture (normal and noble)\r\n- the archerytarget\r\n- the wooden chest (including a snow-edition)\r\n\r\nDoesn\\'t sound too much, but you\\'d be surprised how many textures are replaced ingame.\r\nI hope you enjoy this.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nCopy the files to your [...]SteamApps/common/skyrim/data folder - done\r\n\r\nMISSING TEXTURES:\r\n- The noble bed... an awful lot of work, coming soon.\r\n\r\n[URL=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2632&tab=3&navtag=/modules/comments/comments_ajax.php?tid=486136|:|fid=2632] My HD Bar-Retexture[/URL]",
