  "descriptionHtml": "I always thought it was kind of silly that the difficulty affects the player\\\\\\'s damage, effectively making combat boring (you get one hit by an arrow, but to kill someone you have to hack and slash 50 times).\r\n\r\nThis makes the hard (expert), very hard (master) have 1x multipliers to Player damage, maintaining the old multipliers to damage received.\r\n\r\nLegendary has 0.5x player output damage, and 3x incoming damage. \r\n\r\n\\\\\\\"Wait, you just said it was silly that difficulty affects the player damage, but you have decreased it anyway?\\\\\\\"\r\n-Yes, because the name says it all. It should provide an extra challenge, and the extra 0.25x i gave should reduce the hack and slash feel it has. This gives the illusion of NPCs having 2x health, which in my opinion befits the LEGENDARY difficulty very well. There is a 1x legendary multiplier as well, for people that think legendary is too hard or is using a mod that already does that.\r\n\r\nThis mod is extremely recommended when using a mod that already makes combat harder.\r\n\r\nHave fun!",
