  "descriptionHtml": "This mod increases the chance to instantly kill with Mehrune\\'s Razor. Vanilla chance is 2,5% and this mod increases it to 5%. I always felt the Mehrune\\'s Razor was too weak, not in it\\'s pure damage but in it\\'s enchantment. This mod increases the chance to instantly kill but also keeps it from being overpowered. \r\n\r\nThis mod shouldn\\'t conflict with any mod regarding Mehrune\\'s Razor as long as they don\\'t tamper with the enchantment or scripting in any way.
