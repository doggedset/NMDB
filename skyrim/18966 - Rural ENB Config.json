  "summary": "A beautiful Rural/Rustic config that brings out skyrim\\'s colors and creates a very warm and welcoming atmosphere full of color and balance.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i872.photobucket.com/albums/ab281/shivanthing/Skyrim%20Photoshooting/RuralLogo.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nI\\'m getting pretty good at creating ENB\\'s, so I decided to go with something more rural and rustic this time around- you may have seen my previous rustic config but i felt it was very unpolished- so here I am with a very well polished rustic config. You will not be blinded by lights, and the light rays will surely beckon to your senses. :) The config comes in two flavors, no SSAO (performance) and with SSAO (More depth to shadows but less performance.) If you like and enjoy this config, leave a comment and endorse! :)\r\n\r\nSo now the long haul!!\r\n\r\n[b]---WHAT THIS IS---[/b]\r\nThis is a very nice config that adds to skyrim\\'s atmosphere in a unique and semi-realistic way. (Some aspects are realistic while others are not. Depends on how you look at it as well.)  Nights appear dark, while daytime appears bright and welcoming. An opposite of my previous ENB configs where they created a cold and surreal atmosphere. \r\n\r\n[b]---WHAT THIS IS NOT[/b]\r\nThis is not a super bright surreal config that totally mutilate\\'s skyrim\\'s color scheme. The color scheme remains partially the same while still adding to the current to create a nice rural/rustic look that will appeal to a nice variety of people. The game is totally playable with this config.\r\n\r\n[b]---INSTALLATION---[/b]\r\nJust drop the contents of the RAR in your root directory, if you got a current skyrim ENB config, back it up. If you don\\'t have software to open RAR files go grab winrar from here. \r\n\r\n[url=http://www.rarlab.com]Winrar[/url]\r\n\r\nAfter you install those contents, go to boris vorontsov\\'s website and get the ENBinjector.exe. It can be found here. Drop this into your root directory as well.\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.enbdev.com/download_injector_generic.htm]ENBInjector[/url]\r\n\r\n[b]---UNINSTALLATION---[/b]\r\nJust delete everything that came with the mod.\r\n\r\n[b]---HOW TO USE---[/b]\r\nInstall this config as described, then run the ENBinjetor.exe before running skyrim. Then run skyrim to get it to work.\r\n\r\n[b]---NOTE---[/b]\r\nYou may ask \\\"Why is it so dark?!\\\" Or \\\"Why is it so bright?!?!\\\" Please note our monitor levels differ, so adjust the brightness ingame to your liking. HOWEVER a darker atmosphere is a part of this mod, so do not be confused. It may or may not be difficult to tell the difference from the depth and the actual brightness. Look at the video for a good reference to gamma!\r\n\r\n[b]---RECOMMENDED MODS---[/b]\r\nMore Rain- This config was designed around it, so consider grabbing it! (Not Requried)\r\nMore Snow- This config was designed around it, so consider grabbing it! (Not Required)\r\nBetter Females By Bella- Was used in the making of the screen shots! (Not Required)\r\nSkyrim HD 2k Textures- If you got enough Vram (1gb) go for it! (Not Required)\r\n\r\n[b]---LARGE SAMPLE SCREENSHOTS---[/b]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i872.photobucket.com/albums/ab281/shivanthing/Skyrim%20Photoshooting/Alia4.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i872.photobucket.com/albums/ab281/shivanthing/Skyrim%20Photoshooting/Alia2-1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i872.photobucket.com/albums/ab281/shivanthing/Skyrim%20Photoshooting/TakingtheShot.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i872.photobucket.com/albums/ab281/shivanthing/Skyrim%20Photoshooting/Ex4.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i872.photobucket.com/albums/ab281/shivanthing/Skyrim%20Photoshooting/Alia3.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n",
