  "summary": "This is a boost for most low to mid end computer or laptop, this will give a very good texture, for Skyrim. NOTE: this, will remove shadow and make it seem like it has more blocky texture, but it shouldn&#39;t be too bad.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a little tweak to boost your frames per second (fps), when I didn&#39;t did this i would get 19 or lower fps outside and 30 fps inside house or etc. With this tweak I got 35-40 fps almost any where, and when i&#39;m inside house or building i get 50-60 or more fps. This should give you more fps to at lest play a decent game. This tweak is for if you have a maximum of Â CPU: 2.40GHz   Ram: 4GB or better for you computer or laptop, but im not sure if RAM is going to effect it so yeah. Just make sure that if you can play ultra setting with 30 or less fps then this will help you a lot. If you get not alot of fps then search &#34;fps&#34; and &#34;performance&#34; this will give you a lot of mod or what not and also give you extra boost for fps. I hope this help&#33;",
