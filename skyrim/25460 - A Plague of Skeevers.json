  "descriptionHtml": "A quick little mod that add the ability to summon a horde of plague riddled skeevers.\r\n\r\nWhat\\'s the single most skeever filled dung hole in Skyrim? That\\'s right! You can find everything you need in the basement of the Horningbrew meadery. The skill allows you to summon 5 skeevers at a time to a maximum of 15. Each rat is bathed in various diseases and has it\\'s teeth sharpened with poison infused sand paper just moments before they are summoned. They make quick work of pretty much everything.\r\n\r\nPlease note: There is more than one download for this mod now. Those that want a spell more similar to the dishonored skill  devouring swarm go to DOWNLOAD tab and select The skeever horde dishonored \r\n\r\nSome technical notes:\r\nKeep this mod low on your load order, especially in my upcoming mod \\\"Dragons of Daenerys\\\"\r\nThis is my first mod. As such the spell description is a tad lackluster and I am planning on changing it for your viewing pleasure. Also it\\'s kinda constructed inefficiently so there may be slow down on less powerful rigs. I welcome all constructive criticism and any advice anyone gives me.\r\nA fully updated skyrim is recommended. Not 100% certain if it\\'s needed.",
