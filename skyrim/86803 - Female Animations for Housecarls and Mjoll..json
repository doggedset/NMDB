I recommend rebashing your bashed patch so that you can use this mod alongside other NPC editors (e.g.: Bijin Mods)\r<br />\r<br />Installation: Open the archive and drop the plugin into the Data file.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements: Skyrim (duh)\r<br />\r<br />Recommended: Bashed Patch (to use alongside other NPC editors)\r<br />",
