  "descriptionHtml": "This is a joke mod which changes the name of all horkers to &#34;Wordbanks&#34;, made on request.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wordbank-walrus]http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wordbank-walrus[/url]\r<br />\r<br />WordBank (Walrus) is an internet meme which started as an in-joke on Reddit inspired by a photograph of a preschooler’s incorrect response to an English vocabulary quiz misidentifying a drawing of Walrus as a “word bank,” a term used to indicate the portion of the prompt listing all answer choices in a test. \r<br />\r<br />Not just content with changing the names of the animals themselves, I&#39;ve also changed other items so you can now have &#34;Wordbank Stew&#34;, &#34;Wordbank Tusks&#34;, etc.  Plus the book &#34;Wordbank Attacks&#34; with all necessary changes to the text.\r<br />\r<br />Images above uploaded to Reddit by gynoceros - their usage here is presumed to be fair use.",
