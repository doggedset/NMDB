  "descriptionHtml": "Hey, finally managed to get this retex pack done after six hours of texture editing, screenshotting, and image editing. The majority of the work actually went into the \r\nscreenshotting and screenshot editing, lol..\r\nIf you like the mod, let me know in your comments.\r\nAlso, don\\'t hesitate to endorse, because it really helps in getting more views in the long run.\r\n\r\n\r\n======\r\nNOTES\r\n======\r\n\r\n* If you want more screenshots to convince you, download the Screenshot Package archive. Why? It has over 200 screenshots.\r\n\r\n* The textures no longer cause lag like in my sword retex beta (see below), as they are now 1024x1024, rather than 1536x1536. This cuts the size down by almost 1mb and improves the way the mod runs immensely.\r\n\r\n* Elven Sword Retex Beta: http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=309\r\n\r\n\r\n======\r\nInstall\r\n======\r\n\r\nTo install, extract the texture folder into:\r\nSteam > SteamApps > Common > Skyrim > Data\r\nIf you are asked to merge the folder, say yes.\r\n\r\nFor the textures to take effect, you need to navigate to:\r\nSkyrim > Data > textures > weapons > elven\r\nIn the \\\"elven\\\" folder are eight other folders, named after each weapon.\r\nGo into each folder and remove the \\\"colour name\\\" from the file name.\r\nSo, for example, in the \\\"swords\\\" folder, if you want to use the \\\"dark\\\" texture, change \\\"sword_d dark\\\" to \\\"sword_d\\\"\r\n\r\n!!!!YOU MUST DO THIS TO ALL WEAPONS FOR THE MOD TO WORK!!!!\r\n\r\nIf you wish to change textures to another one, add the text back into the file name of the currently used texture, and remove it from the one you want to use.\r\n\r\n\r\n=======\r\nDisable\r\n=======\r\n\r\nTo temporarily disable the mod and revert back to the original textures, navigate to:\r\nSkyrim > Data > textures > weapons > elven > (weapon folder)\r\nIn the weapon folders corresponding to the weapons you want to disable, rename the currently used texture (the one without a \\\"colour name\\\" at the end) so it is no longer one of the following:\r\n\r\nelvenbattleaxe\r\nbow\r\ndagger_d\r\ngreatsword_d\r\nhandaxe\r\nmace\r\nsword_d\r\nelvenwarhammer\r\n\r\nIf the file is no longer one of the above, the \\\"texture path\\\" will be broken, and the game will return to using the textures packaged in \\\"textures.bsa\\\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=========\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\n\r\nTo uninstall, navigate to:\r\nSkyrim > Data > textures > weapons > elven > (weapon folder)\r\nIn each weapon folder, delete the following textures:\r\n(note: there will always be a missing file in each folder, because you need to rename one for it to be active (unless you copy it and then rename it..))\r\n\r\nelvenbattleaxe blue\r\nelvenbattleaxe dark\r\nelvenbattleaxe golden\r\nelvenbattleaxe light\r\nelvenbattleaxe red\r\nelvenbattleaxe silver\r\nelvenbattleaxe\r\nbow blue\r\nbow dark\r\nbow golden\r\nbow light\r\nbow red\r\nbow silver\r\nbow\r\ndagger_d blue\r\ndagger_d dark\r\ndagger_d golden\r\ndagger_d light\r\ndagger_d red\r\ndagger_d silver\r\ndagger_d\r\ngreatsword_d blue\r\ngreatsword_d dark\r\ngreatsword_d golden\r\ngreatsword_d light\r\ngreatsword_d red\r\ngreatsword_d silver\r\ngreatsword_d\r\nhandaxe blue\r\nhandaxe dark\r\nhandaxe golden\r\nhandaxe light\r\nhandaxe red\r\nhandaxe silver\r\nhandaxe\r\nmace blue\r\nmace dark\r\nmace golden\r\nmace light\r\nmace red\r\nmace silver\r\nmace\r\nsword_d blue\r\nsword_d dark\r\nsword_d golden\r\nsword_d light\r\nsword_d red\r\nsword_d silver\r\nsword_d\r\nelvenwarhammer blue\r\nelvenwarhammer dark\r\nelvenwarhammer golden\r\nelvenwarhammer light\r\nelvenwarhammer red\r\nelvenwarhammer silver\r\nelvenwarhammer\r\n\r\n(damn that\\'s a lot of files)\r\n\r\n================\r\nLegal and Thanks\r\n================\r\n\r\nNo one may use my textures without notifying me first. If they are used in screenshots, a note must be made on the screenshot description to say where to get the textures. Why? It\\'s nice to show people where all the fancy mods on your screenshots came from.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to upload this to a site outside of skyrimnexus or skyrimforge, you MUST message me so we can sort something out.\r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for the great game and for the textures I edited to make this.\r\n\r\nTools used were Photoshop and 7zip ",
