  "descriptionHtml": "Door_To_Valerica\\'s_Study: By TailAbNormal \r\n\r\nWhat It Does: Adds an entrance/exit to the Volkhanier castle balcony connected\r\nto the castles east tower.\r\n   You need a key (located on the ground of the balcony near the new door) to \r\nopen the entrance. \r\n\r\nBugs: For some reason, entering the balcony through the east tower door will \r\nteleport you to the ground below the balcony. \r\n   I have no Idea what is causing this\r\nbut It only seems to happen once, so If it does, just TCL back up and save the \r\ngame and it shouldn\\'t happen again.
