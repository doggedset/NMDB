  "summary": "Yes - another mod that alters the Destruction skill tree. But this one will only add a plus 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% destruction spell effect boost (damage) on advancement through the Destruction ranks... And nothing else. No fancy new spells, no naked khajiits. Nothing. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "IM CURRENTLY WORKING TO FIX A BUG THAT MADE EVERY SPELL MAGNITUDE IN THE GAME FOLLOW THE TREE. THE MOD WILL BE UPLOADED AS SOON AS I\\'M SHURE I\\'VE FIXED IT PROPERLY. IT WILL BE WORTH THE TIME. \r\n\r\nThis mod alters the Destruction skill tree, to boost your Destruction spell magnitude (damage) for every advancement in the tree. \r\nNo other effects are altered or removed (you\\'ll still get the Â½ magica perk for every advancement).\r\n\r\nThe numbers: \r\n\r\nNovice destruction \t= \t+ 10% \r\nApprentice destruction \t=\t+ 20% \r\nAdept destruction \t=\t+ 30% \r\nExpert destruction \t=\t+ 40% \r\nMaster destruction \t=\t+ 50% \r\n\r\nYou\\'ll get the feeling of really mastering magic.\r\n\r\nFor example the \\\"flames spell\\\" will start out as 8 points of damage per second. \r\n\r\nWith novice destruction \t= \t 8 dmg/sec \r\nWith apprentice destruction \t= \t10 dmg/sec\r\nWith adept destruction \t\t= \t13 dmg/sec\r\nWith expert destruction \t= \t19 dmg/sec\r\nWith master destruction \t= \t28 dmg/sec\r\n\r\nIt may seem overpowered when you look at the numbers... \r\nBut with the enemies gaining levels I find it pretty spot on. \r\n\r\nIt also helps when fighting modded dragons on higher difficulty :)\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\nMy mods on Nexus: \r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19019]Lynges Better Destruction Tree Mod[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16913]Lynges Death Reload Time[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16914]Lynges No Loading Screen Text Mod[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16916]Lynges Real Arrows Mod[/url]",
