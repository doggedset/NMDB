  "descriptionHtml": "\t\t\t\t\tTHE PIT OF SORROW\r<br />\r<br />The Pit of Sorrow, the forgotten 17th plane of Oblivion which is ruled by Nemesis, the Daedra Prince of Damnation. Nemesis is the oldest and most powerful of the Daedra princes. Fearing his power the other Daedra Princes have kept Nemesis and The Dark Ones Trapped in their realm and all knowledge of them was striken from history.\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a new quite vast worldspace called the Pit of Sorrow for you to explore. It is fully cluttered, populated and Navmeshed. As of now it only has one lengthy main quest(I hope to add a lot more in future updates).\r<br />\r<br />To start the quest investigate the Forgotten Old Shack near Embershard Mine(Map Marker Visible)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />IMPORTANT&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; IN ORDER FOR THE CUSTOM GRASS TO WORK PROPERLY:\r<br />\r<br />OPEN UP BOTH Skyrim.ini and SkyrimPrefs.ini AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE [Grass] SECTION ADD/ALTER THIS: \r<br />\r<br />bAllowLoadGrass=0 \r<br />bAllowCreateGrass=1 \r<br />bDrawShaderGrass=1 \r<br />\r<br />(This is a known Bethesda bug and currently this is the only fix)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />FEATURES\r<br />\r<br />1 Main Questline\r<br />Unique Climate\r<br />New enemies\r<br />Unique combat/exploration music\r<br />New weapons and armor\r<br />small bik movies\r<br />Voice acting\r<br />\r<br />V1.2\r<br />\r<br />Fixed Object LOD\r<br />Fixed missing Coldharbour Armor textures\r<br />Fixed Pain Attronach Armor normal maps\r<br />Improved Razak-Val\r<br />Added new enemies, weapons, armor\r<br />Added 2 new quests (3 in total)\r<br />Added purchasable player home\r<br />Removed havok settle from chest key in mysterious shack to stop it falling through furniture\r<br />Added trigger box to remove all Pit of Sorrow music upon re-entering SKyrim\r<br />\r<br />REQUIREMENTS:   Dawnguard & Latest Skyrim Update\r<br />\r<br />Mod cleaned with TES5EDIT\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION\r<br />\r<br />Unrar, Copy and paste everything to the data folder, check PitofSorrow.esm and POS.esp in Skyrim Data Files and your good to go&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS\r<br />\r<br />Credit to Matthieu Pinsonneault for LubaSkywings which were used for the Dark One wings\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />VOICE ACTING\r<br />\r<br />The Dark Ones \t\t        Male Voice Jon Stawarz (Voice Actors Alliance)\r<br />\t       \t\t                Female Voice Cody Bear(Voice Actors Alliance)\r<br />\r<br />VokulDrogDoFaas\t\t        Stuart Armstrong (Voice Actors Alliance)\r<br />& Lord of Agony\t\t\r<br />\r<br />Tormented Flesh Daerda      Christopher David Cerda.
