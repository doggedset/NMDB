  "summary": "Changes the spell \\\"Summon Followers\\\" spell by AeonVita (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26693) into a lesser power and activated like a Voice power (default Z key).",
  "descriptionHtml": "[color=red][size=4]Description[/size][/color]\r\nI like, and use, AeonVita\\'s [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26693]Summon Followers[/url] mod, but I didn\\'t like that it is a spell. Why? Because sometimes during combat I might need help and my followers are fighting some other mobs somewhere else. Equipping a spell would mean I would lose my shield (if left hand) or unequip my 2-hander which I may be using at that moment. Using the summon as a voice solves this problem. \r\n\r\nRoleplay-wise, isn\\'t it more realistic to be yelling \\\"Help me! Come over here!\\\" to your followers instead? :) Or if you\\'re running in the wilds and your followers get lost, it seems more realistic for you to be yelling \\\"Hey I\\'m over here!\\\"\r\n\r\nHence, making the summon as a voice power seemed to make more sense.\r\n\r\nSo, I just changed the spell into a lesser power and you can activate it like any other powers with the Z key (by default if you have not changed it).\r\n\r\n[color=red][size=4]Requirements[/size][/color]\r\n1. [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26693]Summon Followers mod[/url]. Choose the version you want, with or without choices\r\n\r\nThis mod is [u]NOT[/u] a standalone mod!\r\n\r\n[color=red][size=4]Update[/size][/color]\r\nAeonVita released an \\\"alternative\\\" version which allow you to choose which follower to summon, including those that are waiting or relaxed (sandbox) mode. Thus I have changed his ESP (but not his script) again to use the summon as voice. Please choose only ONE from AeonVita\\'s mod and install the corresponding one from here. [u]The 2 do NOT mix and are mutually exclusive![/u]\r\n\r\n[color=red][size=4]Installation[/size][/color]\r\n1. Download [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26693]AeonVita\\'s mod[/url] and install that first.\r\n2. Install mine by overwriting the ESP file in your Skyrim\\\\Data folder. \r\n\r\nNote - NMM install is [b]**HIGHLY DISCOURAGED**[/b] unless you know exactly how NMM works and answer the right questions when NMM pops those question dialog boxes up (upgrade? Overwrite? Remove? etc).\r\n\r\n[color=red][size=4]Credits[/size][/color]\r\nThanks to AeonVita for creating the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26693]Summon Followers mod[/url].\r\n\r\n[color=red][size=4]Permissions[/size][/color]\r\nPlease seek permission from AeonVita, not me, if you want to modify his mod.",
