  "summary": "Changes the maximum pickpocket chance and reduces the penalty for high value items",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is just a very simple mod that raises the maximum pickpocket chance to 100% and makes the gold value of the item count 1/10th of the vanilla setting when calculating the chance for success.\r<br />\r<br />It never made sense to me that expensive, yet small items can be all but impossible to steal.  I can agree you might pay a little more attention to your more valuable things, but you don&#39;t put motion sensors on them...In the vanilla game, it is easier to steal a full suit of armor than it is to steal one enchanted gold ring.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m only uploading this because I figured that if I wanted a simple change to pickpocket that doesn&#39;t affect perks or other massive stealth gameplay changes, then someone else might want it as well.\r<br />\r<br />This only changes the pickpocketmaxchance and the pickpocketvaluemult settings and is compatible with any mod that doesn&#39;t change either of those.",
