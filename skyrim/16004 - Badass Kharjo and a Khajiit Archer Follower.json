Able to marry(if vanilla khajiits can).[/size]\n<br />[size=3]Kharjo appearance and stats change to match Ja'dirr.[/size]\n<br />[size=3]Both are set as essential.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[u][size=4]About the mod:[/size][/u]\n<br />[size=3]I have used some followers during my time playing Skyrim and I saw that there were no khajiit archers in the game so I made one: Ja´dirr. He uses ebony weapons.[/size]\n<br />[size=3]I also thought that Kharjo needed a make-over. Therefore I have made him into a white tiger khajiit, ready to kick ass along your side. But if you only want Ja'dirr that's now possible too.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=4][u]Skills/Perks:[/u][/size]\n<br />[size=3]Kharjo: Light foot, muffled movement, shield wall, juggernaut 0 - 40, armsman 0 - 40 etc. Nothing out of place really. It's all tailored to fit his class. 1.15 level mult.[/size]\n<br />[size=3]Ja'dirr: Light armor and bows. Perks: Overdraw 0 - 40, Quickshot, Ranger, Lightfoot, Muffled Movement, Range of Movement, Deadly Aim, Silence, Stealth 0-40. Nothing out of place really. It's all tailored to fit his class. 1.15 level mult.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=4][u]Potential Conflicts:[/u][/size]\n<br />[size=3]In order to have Ja'dirr travel with the caravans I had to put him in the [b]FormList: 0001B1CC; the CaravansNPCList.[/b] I also put him as a member of the Quest [b]0003ACDB; Caravans.[/b] The quest responsible for khajiits traveling together. Kharjo is already in them by default.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=3]If you are using my mod [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13448?]Nib's Male followers[/url] and this you need to switch to the Kharjo Only version of this mod. If you don't you'll either have 2 Ja'dirrs or 1 that doesn't travel.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[u][size=4]Location:[/size][/u]\n<br />[size=3]Kharjo is traveling with the caravan which goes between Dawnstar and Riften. Ja'dirr should also tag along. I usually wait in the Riften caravan camp(campfire next to the stable) for them. You need to have finished his quest to have Kharjo as a follower. Ja'dirr should work from the get-go.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[u][size=4]Misc[/size][/u]\n<br />[size=3]Ja'dirr's bow and arrows in the images are from this mod: [/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2916/][size=3]CL's Weapon-replacer's[/size]\n<br />[size=4]\n<br />[/size][/url][u][size=4]My other followers\n<br />[/size][/u]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13016/?][size=3]Celia the Kettle-Maiden Standalone Lore-Friendly Housecarl Follower[/size][/url][size=3][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13448/?]Nib's Male Followers[/url]\n<br />[color=#ff0000][b]Note:\n<br />If you want to use Nib's Male Followers too you need to switch to the Kharjo Only version of this mod.
