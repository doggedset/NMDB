  "descriptionHtml": "The weapon was an attempt at making Artemis Entreri\\'s signature dagger from the Forgotten Realms book series. There are six versions of the dagger that are craftable by the player once the player has the necessary blacksmithing level and perk unlocked as well as the crafting materials. The daggers are balanced so that you can craft the proper weapon to suit your own personal level of play (novice-master) as well as the stage of the game you are in.\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\nDaggers 5 and 6 each have a slight difference to Daggers 1-4 as they are not only noticeably more powerful but also have a tweak in their inherent speed and crit. The values have been raised slightly above normal for those high level players playing on master. Keep in mind that these can be tempered, so if you feel the enchantment is too high, feel free to use a lesser dagger and temper it.\r\n\r\nVampiric Dagger Level 1:\r\n\r\nNative 5 damage with a magnitude of 5 absorb health and 5 absorb stamina, soul trap for 1 second.\r\n\r\nVampiric Dagger Level 2:\r\n\r\nNative 10 damage with a magnitude of 10 absorb health and 10 absorb stamina, soul trap for 1 second.\r\n\r\nVampiric Dagger Level 3:\r\n\r\nNative 15 damage with a magnitude of 15 absorb health and 15 absorb stamina, soul trap for 1 second.\r\n\r\nVampiric Dagger Level 4:\r\n\r\nNative 30 damage with a magnitude of 30 absorb health and 30 absorb stamina, soul trap for 1 second.\r\n\r\nVampiric Dagger Level 5:\r\n\r\nNative 50 damage with a magnitude of 50 absorb health and 50 absorb stamina, soul trap for 1 second.\r\n\r\nVampiric Dagger Level 6:\r\n\r\nNative 75 damage with a magnitude of 100 absorb health and 100 absorb stamina, soul trap for 1 second.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\nOutdated Information for the Old Files\r\n-----------------\r\nThe dagger is pretty well balanced as it cannot be upgraded using the blacksmithing perks. Overall it is a nice blade for the assassin/thief type characters. It can be added in game with the console command - player.additem 000ca1d3. If anyone would like to make any suggestions or requests for a modification of this mod, or explain how I can add this item to a vendor, feel free to comment.\r\n-----------------\r\nUpdate\r\n-----------------\r\nAn optional file was added that introduced a more powerful version of the previous enchantment with an added bonus. Meant for higher level players, players playing on master, or those who wish to have an overpowered dagger. The higher level dagger may be added with the console command \\\"player.additem 000ca1d4 1\\\". An image of the new enchantment was loaded - 100 absorb health, 100 absorb stamina, soul trap 1 second.",
