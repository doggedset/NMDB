  "summary": "A Breton whose skill in stealth, marksmanship, healing, sword, and destruction is currently unrivaled in the lands of Skyrim.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Andrathis is physically based off a character from a story of mine. Though, his journies are utterly seperate from those of his Skyrim avatar. I have tinkered around with this fellow for a majority of my play time. Finished the Thieves Guild, working on the College and the Main Quest. Messed around with console, set some perks, used no prerequisites, and basically tested out a range of mods and the majority of what I could in the time given. And as always with Saves, stick em\\' in your Documents/My Games/Skyrim/Saves folder.\r\n\r\nHave fun with my character, he\\'s a ginger... not some smelly old chef. So treat him well.\r\n",
