  "descriptionHtml": "Please mod has been replaced by: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22290\r\nAll new updates will be applied to Craft Temper Smelt.\r\n\r\nSo I started a Khajiit, and wanted to go all unarmed combat. Although quickly finding out that I was severely disadvantaged to armed combat. So like any gamer I searched Nexus for some Unarmed Combat mods. Found about 15 of them, but all of them seem to either totally change how unarmed combat is done, adding perk trees, scripts, or unfinished brass knuckle type weapons.\r\nI looked at how skyrim handles unarmed combat and thought, just make stronger Gloves of the Pugilist. I wanted a mod that keeps the original skyrim style of unarmed combat but allow it to be effective through out the game. No scripts, no perk trees, and no WIP invisible weapons.\r\n\r\nI added Unarmed Spiked Gauntlets of each armor material type and cloth, and created an Unarmed Enchantment for each one. From 10, 25, 50, 75, 100. They all use the Stormcloak Officer Gloves as a model with Fists of Steel Perk attribute on them.\r\n\r\nSo enjoy bashing anything and everything through out the game instead of up to level 15 or so.\r\nBTW this is already in my Forge Equipment mod so no need to get this if you have that.\r\n\r\nv1.00: Release\r\nv1.01: Added Light versions along with Cloth one as well.\r\nv1.02: Bug fix missed Glass Gauntlets Disenchant flag.",
