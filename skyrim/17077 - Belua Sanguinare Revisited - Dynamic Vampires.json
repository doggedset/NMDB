That it, pardon the pun, kinda sucks? Well, your experience is about to undergo quite a change. No longer will vampires get the short end of the stick. No longer will they simply be \\\"magic blood mages\\\" with a idiosyncratic blood drinking ability. We didn\\'t think that was right for a game as grand as Skyrim. We looked to change that. \r\n\r\nWhere other mods either give you unrelated, overpowered, and entirely lore breaking abilities, BSR breaks new ground. Every vampire source from the last 2000 years has been examined to maintain the best possible consistency with real world lore, and the TES scrolls poured over time and time again to mesh it with that of Tamriel. From there, a professionally debugger with years of experience created an indepth, tactical, and intritcately interwoven skill and sustenence system to actually afford vampires options...not just giving them mechanically straightforward and overpowered abilities. This framework was then tested over the period of several weeks by dozens of beta testers, all of whom provided feedback, which we took aaannnnd...well. You see the result. A vampire mod to truly give them the place they deserve in the desolate north but distinct and useful. No, our vampires are a whole other being altogether. Man or monster, well, I can\\'t clarify that much, since it is up to you. After all, what is a man? [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMTizJemHO8&feature=player_detailpage#t=37s]But enough talk..![/url]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/Rb3ZB.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/9gkn7.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n[color=#FF0000][center][b]Please read the included documentation for installation procedures, uninstallation, and deeper notes about the systems and spells. There are, however, some last minute changes that did not make it into the documentation, or were updated. Future revisions will include those changes. \r\n\r\nPLEASE backup your save game. The scripting in this mod is extensive. Additionally, you MUST uninstall the mod via the uninstallation steps in the documentation once you\\'ve become a Belua Sanguinare Vampire. \r\n\r\nCOMPATIBILITY: Mods which alter the loot tables of all NPCs, and of course other vampire specific mods are not compatible yet! Custom races are working in the 1.3.2 Beta 4 and up. You needn\\'t activate the loot tables (it\\'s under a different load order), and...well, use this vampire mod :P[/b][/center][/color]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/1MgEr.jpg?1[/img][/center]\r\nFirst things first. In Belua Sanguinare, there are five levels or ranks, as opposed to the typical four from vanilla.\r\n * Fledgling\r\n * Risen\r\n * Master\r\n * Progenitor\r\n * Sire\r\nDoesn\\'t seem to be that different, but hang tight! Each level will grant new passive abilities, spells, powers and weaknesses but some things are shared between them all. More specifically, those general differences being:\r\n[i]\r\n[b]Resistance to Disease[/b]\r\nAs a Vampire you are fully resistant to disease.\r\n\r\n[b]Weakness to Sunlight[/b]\r\nIn all stages of Vampirism you will possess a weakness to direct sunlight. Within the sunlight you will not regenerate Health, Stamina, or Magicka and you will take varying amounts of damage per second. These values DO NOT SCALE with your Player Level, only your Vampire Level. At the highest level of Vampirism you will take a larger amount of damage in direct sunlight\r\n\r\n[b]Trespassing[/b]\r\nVampires are mysteriously stricken with pain and suffering while forcing themselves into private locations. If you are trespassing you will take health damage at the same degree as you would with direct sunlight damage. As players are required to feed, you should think twice about trying to feed from victims that are in locations that you may consider having to trespass.\r\n\r\n[b]Weakness to Garlic[/b]\r\nThe common folk are very a superstitious lot, but they have good reasons to put their faith in lore. If they are carrying garlic, this can interfere with certain vampiric abilities you may have and you cannot feed from anyone carrying garlic. \r\n\r\n[b]Weakness to Silver[/b]\r\nAs a vampire, you will have a greater weakness to silver weapons that will become amplified as your rank increases. \r\n\r\n[b]Weakness to Fire[/b]\r\nSimilar to Garlic and Silver, vampires are less resistant to fire than normal. Don\\'t assume that Dunmer Blood will provide any protection. \r\n\r\n[b]Shrines[/b]\r\nShrines of the Nine can be deadly to the Belua Sanguinare Vampire. As you approach a shrine you will be blinded by it\\'s holy aura and begin to take damage relative to your proximity and Vampire Rank. In other words, get out of the Solitude temple!\r\n\r\n[b]Hunger and Satiation[/b]\r\nAs a vampire, you have a requirement for blood that must be satiated. If your satiation level gets too low you be warned by \\\"Sangue Senso\\\" being forced upon you. There is only one type of source that will provide the blood you need and those are living breathing victims.\r\nThere are six levels of Satiation\r\n[list][*] Nomal or Satiated - Level 5 Satiation\r\n[*] Unsatiated - Level 4 Satiation\r\n[*] Hungry - Level 3\r\n[*] Famished - Level 2\r\n[*] Ravenous - Level 1\r\n[*] Starved/Starving - Level 0[/list]\r\nBy default, your level of satiation drops a small bit every hour in the game and various strengths, bonuses, and weaknesses are applied at each stage. \r\n\r\nThe degree to which you can hide your true nature from others may vary depending on your vampire level and your level of satiation. If you allow your satiation to drop too much, you will be revealed and may be attacked on sight by guards and certain other citizens. Of course, that\\'s not to say there isn\\'t certain benefits to being a starving aberration...\r\n\r\n[b]Harvesting Hearts[/b]\r\nAt the early onset of the game, harvesting hearts from fresh victims is not such a necessity, however it becomes a primary source of healing and restoring magicka and stamina as Potions will no longer work and Restoration Spells become less effective on yourself as you grow through your levels of Vampirism.\r\n\r\n[b]Vampire Feeding[/b]\r\nFeeding is your only source of satiation and will harm your victim depending on how hungry you are. If you feed upon someone, you will regain a certain level of Satiation back. Be aware, that feeding on a  victim will typically do a percentage of damage equal to how hungry you are. You can kill by feeding too much. \r\n\r\nThere are three times you have the opportunity to feed each with varying levels of effectiveness. \r\n[list] \r\n[*] Sleeping Victims: Feeding from sleeping victims currently works very similar to vanilla vampirism. For that classic taste. \r\n[*] In Combat: In combat, if your combatant begins to bleed out, falling to their knees, you can approach and activate them. Doing so will provide you the opportunity to Feed, making a right bloody mess of things. \r\n[*] Sneaking upon a Victim: If you sneak upon a victim and activate them you will be given two choices. Sneak Feed and Pickpocket. You will only be given the Sneak Feed option if you are NOT detected by the individual you are sneaking up on. Others may still see you. Thieving types, this one\\'s for you.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b]Carrying Capacity[/b]\r\nAs you rise in the ranks of Vampirism you will be stronger, and thus able to carry additional load that others could not. \r\n\r\n[b]Attack and Block Effectiveness[/b]\r\nYour vampiric strength will also provide increased effectiveness in damage done by melee and weapon attacks as well as blocking effectiveness. \r\n\r\n[b]Vampiric Sprint[/b]\r\nVampires can sprint at faster speeds than others. The speed at which you can sprint will vary based on whether you are indoors or outdoors. \r\n\r\n[b]Healing Rates[/b]\r\nDepending on which rank you are, and having less effective restoration spells, potions, and even food, your healing rates both out of combat and in combat are improved and get better at each rank. \r\n[/i]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/PdI5K.jpg?1[/img][/center]\r\nOf course, we couldn\\'t stop there. With over two millenia of vampiric abilities for us to sift through, it would be folly not to offer at least some of them to the player! Nope, we have a whole suite planned out for you. Hopefully, they\\'ll meet the macro-level, tactical, and mechanically interesting level that our testers swore to us that they would. Let\\'s have a look, shall we?\r\n\r\n[b][u]===Fledgling Vampires===[/u][/b]\r\nYou\\'ve contracted some kind of degenerative disease. At least...the healers all claimed it was degenerative...\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Dark Sacrifice\r\nShould a victim die and be reanimated after feeding, you can use Dark Sacrifice to kill the reanimated corpse and consume a portion of its health, magicka, and stamina. Tasty! Or...uh..so I\\'m told.\r\n\r\n[*]Drain Lifeforce\r\nThis will allow you to drain the lifeforce from others, doing 10 damage per second. \r\n\r\n[*]Sumo Mortalis Forma\r\nFor Fledgling and Risens, Sumo Mortalis Forma is a dual purpose spell. It alters your outward appearance so that you appear to others as you did before you were turned. It drains magicka at a fairly slow rate except when hungered. When you are hungered, the drain on magicka is more severe.[/list]\r\n\r\n[u][b]===Risen Vampires===[/b][/u]\r\nThat was no ordinary affliction. You can feel your humanity slipping away, but as it spills out, it\\'s replaced with...\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Dark Gift\r\nYou can use this spell to consume a portion of your health upfront for three times the return over a period of ten seconds. Be wary as this consumes satiation in order to provide you with such a boon. The amount of health consumed and rewarded is dependent upon your stage of vampirism. \r\n\r\n[*]Vampiric Command (Animal)\r\nRisens are giving Vampiric Command (Animal) which allows them to command up to three Skeevers. \r\n\r\n[*]Sangue Senso\r\nYou can detect the blood of the living within 150 feet. This consumes no magicka and can be turned on and off\r\n\r\n[*]Immortui et Morte Senso\r\nYou can detect both the dead and undead within 150 feet. This consumes no magicka and can be turned on and off\r\n\r\n[*]Vampire\\'s Sight\r\nRisens gain access to Vampire\\'s Sight, the ability to see well in darkness. The sight improvement is much better at night and provides the ability to toggle off or on permanently. \r\n\r\n[*]Sense Garlic\r\nRisen\\'s gain the ability to sense the presence of Garlic in possession by others. \r\n\r\n[*]Vampiric Evasion\r\nThis is a latent power of vampires which allows them to detect certain attacks and with a quick exertion of speed, avoid the attack if they are quick to move from harm\\'s way.\r\n\r\n[*]Breath of Frost\r\nThe cold grip of the grave has done wonders on your respiratory system. \r\n\r\n[*]Vampires Speed\r\nVampires Speed is a power that increases your speed, but rather than just increase it to uncontrollable levels it slows time down at the cost of draining stamina. Once your stamina is depleted it will stop being effective. This power can be toggled. \r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[u][b]===Master Vampires===[/b][/u]\r\nVampirism. That\\'s what it is. Having embraced that fact, you have cast aside your mortal coil for one which is, if not springier, one at least a lot more versatile.\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Vampire\\'s Kiss\r\nVampire\\'s kiss provides a way to charm an individual, forcing them to find the nearest bed and sleep. If you are trespassing and can charm the owner of the location you are in, the owner will no longer consider you as trespassing while under the effects. If the location is owned by a faction, you merely need to charm a member of that faction. Hot.\r\n\r\n[*]Sumo Mortalis Forma \r\nAdditionally serves to enthrall others by providing an increase in speech that counters your speech weakness.\r\n\r\n[*]Breathless\r\nYou may stay submerged under water indefinitely. \r\n\r\n[*]Slow Fall\r\nSlow fall is a channeled spell that can be used to slow the rate of descent when falling. \r\n\r\n[*]Vampire\\'s Light Foot\r\nAs a Master, your feet can move quickly and with little effort. Also great at dances. \r\n\r\n[*]Ianuae Magicae\r\nYou gain the ability to teleport small distances up to 50 feet.\r\n\r\n[*]Spectralem Arma\r\nYou may summon an Etheral Axe to follow and serve you. It cannot be commanded but will attempt to protect and engage enemies.\r\n\r\n[*]Lumen Extinguere\r\nWith this power you can extinguish flames from sconces and carried torches. Doing so will also restore a bit of magicka. The amount restored depends greatly on your vampirism stage. \r\n\r\n[*]Darken\r\nUsing magicka you summon the powers of darkness to envelop you and your weapons. As you attack with them, you will deal extra damage and absorb that amount in health. \r\n\r\n[*]Blood Rend\r\nBlood Rend is a Cloak Like spell which will rend the lifeforce/blood from victims within a certain radius, transferring their health to you.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[u][b]===Progenitor===[/b][/u]\r\nSo this is power, hmm?\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Ianuae Magicae\r\nYou can now teleport approximately 150 feet away.\r\n\r\n[*]Vocare Caligo\r\nThis is a Power and as such can only be used once a day. It will alter weather allowing you to turn a bright and sunny day into a foggy, overcast one. It does not last forever, so use wisely. \r\n\r\n[*]Subvolo\r\nWhile slow fall provided the ability to slow your descent, channeling your powers will allow you to levitate for a short time. \r\n\r\n[*]Dual Cast Perk\r\nCurrently only employed for Spectralem Arma. This perk allows you to dual cast certain vampiric spells if you do not already contain the Dual Cast perk for the schools that they belong to.[/list]\r\n \r\n[u][b]===Sire===[/b][/u]\r\nNo, [u]this[/u] is power. You can see why vampires were once so feared...and that fear will make a return.\r\n[list]\r\n[*]New Command\r\nSire\\'s can command up to three of any combination of Sabrecat, Bear, Wolves, or Skeevers. None will attack the player unless directly provoked (attacked).\r\n\r\n[*]Absorb Racial Trait\r\nWhen feeding on another, you will gain their racial powers and bonuses for three hours. If you use their racial power you will not be able to use it again for that 3 hour duration. \r\n\r\n[*]Ianuae Magicae\r\nYou can now teleport 300 feet away\r\n\r\n[*]Vocare Tempestat\r\nSimilar to the ability Vocare Caligo, this allows the Sire to also conjure a storm, providing twice as much available protection from sunlight.\r\n\r\n[*]Quasi Caligo\r\nOutdoors, the Sire is able to transform themselves into a mist and fly around. They cannot do so if they are IN combat, but once in Mist form they will only turn back if they run out of magicka, get caught in direct sunlight or switch the power off (use power again).[/list]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/sgSUa.jpg?1[/img][/center]\r\nNaturally, we were also on the lookout for players to be able to make a choice, as choice is the main tenant of the TES games to begin with. Depraved soul, desperate for redemption but unable to fully give up that delicious, delicious power? Will you steal men\\'s souls and makes them your slaves? Or will you be the only one left? Either way, that bloody path is never set in stone. This is accomplished through a dynamic and natural progression and regression system. \r\n\r\nProgression and Regression through each of the levels requires certain conditions that must be met.Besides being noted in the incredibly helpful journal you receive, those conditions are:\r\n\r\nFeedCount: Feed count represents how many times you\\'ve fed in a given level and how many times you must feed in order to progress to the next stage of vampirism. \r\n\r\nSatiationDamage: Satiation Damage represents a total percentage of damage you have done to your victims when feeding on them.\r\n\r\nSatiationKills: Satiation Kills represent how many people you need to kill or have killed by feeding, to progress to the next level. \r\n\r\nStarvation: Starvation is the only means by which you can regress levels. You are considered to be starving when your Satiation Level is 0. In order to regress, you must starve yourself for a certain number of days.\r\n\r\nSleep: Sleep is the primary means to trigger a progression or regression once the other appropriate conditions have been met. \r\n\r\nThe Vampire\\'s Journal\r\nThe aforementioned Vampire\\'s Journal is added to your inventory on becoming a Belua Sanguinare Vampire. It is primarily used to track your progress through each of the stages, know your satiation level, how close you are to starving and to know what is required of you to get to the next stage. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/CcTKs.jpg?1[/img][/center]\r\nBelua Sanguinare can be modified to suit your personal tastes in progression. Do you think it\\'s too easy to progress? Do you want to disable the ability to REGRESS altogether or do you simply want to cheat your way to the top? Disable Attack on Sight or enable Attack on Sight[b] ALL[/b] [i]THE[/i] [b][i]TIME?[/i][/b]\r\n\r\nWell, I can\\'t tell you! At least, not here. That\\'s what the [much more in depth] release document is for! There are ways to alter juuuust about everything, so take a look. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/L7Rio.jpg?1[/img][/center]\r\nA big thanks to our active supporters on the Nexus Forums.

For those of you having problems with BeluaMistFormMode 0 or 1, try setting it to 2. It is slower but supports collision detection and more likely to funciton on slower systems or systems bogged down with lots of scripts. \\\"Set BeluaMistFormMode to 2\\\" via console.\r\n- Replaced original SubVolo/Levitation scriping with J3X\\'s broom platform method with adjustments to make sure you just levitated.\r\n- Increased #of cells considered refuges to include additional cells in Castle Volkihar\r\n- Added BeluaDisableVampiresKissDialogue global value. Setting this to a value other than 0 will disable Vampire\\'s Kiss in dialogue tree\\'s. \r\n- Changed default behavior of Vampiric Sprint (fast sprinting ability)\r\n- While sprinting hit your activate button to enable Vampiric Sprint speeds. Hitting activate again will disable and/or it turns off when you stop sprinting\r\n- Set BeluaDisableSprintOnActivate to 1 to use old behavior. \r\n- Added Double-Tap of Forward while NOT in Vampire Lord form will cast Iangue Magicae (Teleport). 30 second cool down.\r\n\r\nV1.3.9.3\r\n- Added additional defaults to mm_BeluaDefaults, mm_BeluaMofoMojosSettings (Thanks RupeyLoops)\r\n- Added mm_BeluaRupeyLoops.

You still get steam effect\r\n- If BeluaSunDamageMode is 5 and you are a Sire your skin will no longer burn. You still get the steam effect\r\n- Changed Drain Sickness to 1 hour\r\n\r\nV1.3.9.1\r\n- Fixed Ianuae Magicae causing slow time spell to stay stuck if you don’t have Dawnguard\r\n- Fixed progression/regression settings so they update in the journal if they are changed via console (requires waiting 1 hour)\r\n- Vampire Lord may now do BSR based feed attacks. \r\n\r\nV1.3.9\r\n- Added dynamic Jump Height scaling with Vampire Level. SKSE Required\r\n- Added dynamic stamina drain with Vampire Level. SKSE Required\r\n- Modified default value of BeluaRottingHeartTime from 1 to 3 hours. This will only effect new games. \r\n- Added BeluaDisableSprintDrainMod to disable sprint drain modification\r\n- Added BeluaDisableumpMod to disable jump height modification\r\n- Added Sprint Drain and Jump Modification to Vampire’s Assistant\r\n- Adding Living Thralls to PlayerFollowerFaction, calling StopCombatAlarm and calling StopCombat as well (previously only added to BeluaVampireFaction and set as player teammate. \r\n- Fixed Undead Thralling option in Vampire’s Assistant.. No longer modifies Sneak Feeding.\r\n- Modified Feed Detection Cloak so it only applies to NPCs (tired of horses getting all excited)\r\n- Changed BeluaDisableShrineDamage to BeluaShrineDamageMode. 0 is normal damage, 1 reverses (Fledglings take more damage than sires) and 2 disables. This will have the effect of enabling shrine damage for people who previously disabled it.\r\n- Added Reverse Shrine Damage mode to Vampire’s Assistant\r\n- Moved Sun and Trespass Damage to Weaknesses conversation tree in Vampire’s Assistant\r\n- Continued to tweak Ianuae Magicae (Teleport) visuals if you own Dawnguard. \r\n- Preservation jars will be added back to inventory after consuming a heart in a jar. There\\'s a 10% chance it will break.\r\n- Added Dawnguard Compatibility support. Mod still does not require DG, but if you’re using DG it’s highly recommended that you use the optional mm_BeluaSanguinareRevisitedDGCompatibility.esp file. You will be warned on game load if you are not using this file and have Dawnguard enabled. This was added as a separate optional download because it may crash users that don’t have DG and try to use it.\r\n\r\nV1.3.8\r\n- Fixed some notification feedback when using Vocare Adjutor\r\n- Fixed a math bug in Darken which was incorrectly calculating the absorption amount (it’s now what the intended values were supposed to be). \r\n- Disabled BSR Feed options from Vampire Lord form as well as Harvest Hearts\r\n- Removed “Has Drain Sickness” effect from blocking Feeds. You will now be able to feed from essential, invulnerable characters, but it will be for naught. Appropriate message should follow. \t\r\n- Fixed up fall damage on Vampire Lord again\r\n- Fixed up little blue squares when getting sun damage.   Left over particle on the membrane shader\r\n- Castle Volkihar is now considered a Refuge. Your sleep will not be interrupted while in the castle. \r\n- By request. Added a Satiation Reminder that provides an onscreen satiation percentage at a user configurable rate. This is disabled by default and can be configured to occur at any rate at 15 seconds or more. Set BeluaSatiationReminderTime to 15. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV1.3.7\r\n- Integrated Dawnguard Feeds with Attack and Sneak Feeds, IF you have Dawnguard. If you don’t have dawnguard, it should still work like normal.\r\n- Fixed a “Getting stuck when in the sunlight” problem…you couldn’t move and would constantly raise your hands to your brow as if shielding your eyes from the sun….it was nice…but wasn’t intended for release and wasn’t completed.\r\n- Fixed typo in mm_BeluaDefaults. \r\n- The BSR Quest Manager now gives back Vampire’s Seduction immediately after removing vanilla vampire spells if you have Dawnguard. If you don’t have dawnguard, no change. \r\n- Fixed Sneak Bug where you were frozen in place if the sneak check failed\r\n- You will not be detected in sunlight when the current weather is the Dawnguard Eclipse, or Auriel’s Bow “Cloudy Weather” effect. If you are taking sun damage and the weather transitions to this state at the same time, it may not work. \r\n- Fixed Sneak Attack Feed Animations breaking for DG users\r\n- Removed All Racial Edits from main BSR module. \r\n- Removes Acitvation Blocker from Vampire Lord (May have to wait about 10 seconds after switching into it for it to work)\r\n- Added Belua Sanguinare Revisisted Configuration Spell. This will summon a helper to configure some of the Belua Sanguinare Settings.\r\n- Changed MagicVampireDrain keyword on Drain Lifeforce spell to mm_BeluaMagicVampireDrain and altered magnitude modifier perk as well. This will keep it from interfering with Vampire Lord’s magnitude. \r\n- You can now always successfully Sneak Feed on Vampire Cattle\r\n- Feeding on Vampire Cattle will not trigger “Feed Detection” cloak any longer. This was not reported as a problem, but seems to be a good measure. \r\n- Added BeluaEnableVampireLordUnblocker to control whether or not unblocking activation capability of Vampire Lord is enabled.\r\n- Added BeluaDisableVampireAssistant to disable the Vampire Assistant and ultimately remove spell from player.\r\n- Added BeluaDisableMortalisRaceChange to control whether or not you change races when using Sumo Mortalis Forma. \r\n- Fixed a problem where you could not get into Vampire Lord form in earlier versions of 1.3.7 Beta due to way Activation Blocker was being disabled. \r\n- Fixed an issue with inadvertently removing VampireVampirism ability (Disease Resist). This ability will not be removed as part of the vanilla abilities. \r\n- Certain BSR Spells and Lesser Powers are now available in Vampire Lord form, based on your Vampire Rank. \r\n- Setting BeluaVampireSightMode to 100 will cause the standard VampireHunterSight spell to be cast, providing support for alternate \r\n- No longer removing standard Vampire Sight. \r\n- As a Vampire Lord you will have access to most all your Vampire Powers when walking, and to all of your Spells and Powers when levitating. \r\n- Removed Rotting Hearts Effect from UI/Active Effects\r\n- If you’re in levitate mode of Vampire Lord you will be protected from falling damage.\r\n\r\n\r\nV1.3.6\r\n- Ghosts are no longer detected as living creatures with blood (Thanks Tylitalo)\r\n- Increased wait time to remove fall damage perk when in mist form to 3 seconds instead of 1 (Thanks zoneofdarkness)\r\n- Removed IsInCombat check on Quasie Caligo, and placed it in the spell script. This will allow you to de-activate the spell if you enter combat but do nothing if you’re already in combat and try to use it. (Thanks zoneofdarkness)\r\n- Removed Shrine Damage magic effect spell description in active effects (Thanks Glacious21)\r\n- Fixed standard cast Spectral Axes so they’ll attack now. Properly Dual Cast Spectral Axes still worked (Thanks Glacious21)\r\n- Fixed description on Breath of Frost (Thanks Glacious21)\r\n- Tweaked feed detection so it doesn’t apply to sleeping NPCs\r\n- Tweaked Vampire Feed script back to always calling SetPlayerAIDriven(false)\r\n- When under the effects of Sumo Mortalis Forma the following abilities are disabled:\r\n - Sense Garlic\r\n - Sense Undead/Dead\r\n - Sense Blood\r\n - Harvesting Hearts\r\n - Embrace of Shadows\r\n - Feeding (all forms)\r\n - All positive hunger based multipliers\r\n  - Critical Chance Multiplier\r\n  - 1H Weapon, 2H Weapon, and Unarmed Damage Multiplier\r\n  - Stamina Regen Multiplier\r\n- Removed IsCommandedActor and IsPlayerTeammate check from Vampire’s Kiss (Sorry Foxamakiir!) :)\r\n- Implemented Sunburning. Get your sunscreen out.  (Thanks Alradaev)\r\n- Fixed Stamina Drain on Vampire’s Speed\r\n- Moved Magicka drain to magic effects, instead of script based on Sumo Mortalis Forma when hungry.\r\n- Changed Toggle Implementation for Sumo Mortalis Forma and removed loud sound effect. \r\n- Modified magic so that certain effects are disabled when Sumo is active, rather than having it remove/re-add spells.\r\n- Fixed Refuges bug with Temple of the Divine Nine Doors point to Vampire Refuge in Riverwood.\r\n- Worked around some additional timing issues with feeding \r\n- Implemented Heart Decomposition. Every hour the system will have a fresh damaged heart decompose into a destroyed heart. It will also have a fresh heart to decompose into a damaged heart. If you have eaten a heart in the last hour, it will not decompose a heart of that type during the check. A heart preservation system will be put into place allowing you to preserve hearts. \r\n- If no bed can be found for the victim of vampire’s kiss, the victim will be forced to lie on the ground if they are not in combat. \r\n- Added BeluaDisableFleshBurning. If you don’t like the flesh burn effect on your character, setting this to 1 will keep it from occurring in the future. \r\n- Modified Bounty Hunter Quests so if they don’t track you down in 72 hours, the quest will auto-stop keeping it from getting in a stuck state where the hunters may have gone missing and never repeating again.\r\n- Added BeluaDisableSneakFeeding. Setting this to any value other than 0 will disable sneak feeding. \r\n- Added BeluaDisableUndeadThralling. Setting this to any value other than 0 will disable undead thralls as a result of feed kills. \r\n- Re-Wrote script version check so it happens automatically on player savegame load.\r\n- Spell Refreshes and script updates no longer have player go through progression/regression animations. Happens pretty quickly now. \r\n- Removed auto attack feeding and prefixed all Belua Sanguinare Revisited feeds with “BSR “, in preperation for Dawnguard. \r\n- Removed overwrite of Bethesda’s VampireFeed perk in preperation for Dawnguard\r\n- Heal rates of feed victims boosted from 1 hour to 24 hours. \r\n- Feed Counts now only apply to unique victims in a 24 hour period while not in combat. Satiation level no longer matters.\r\n- Implemented BeluaRottingHeartTime global value. This sets, in hours, the amount of time that must go by before a heart rots/decays. \r\n- Added Cure Disease every hour in HungerManager to counter vanilla 100% disease resistant bug where you can still catch diseases. This is a bug in vanilla skyrim. Added info to Known Issues. \r\n- Drain Lifeforce now scales damage based on destruction level and vampire rank. Range varies now varies between 2.4/sec as a Fledgling with 10 destruction and 30/sec as a Sire with 100 Destruction.\r\n- Added another Night Eye Image Space, this one specifically geared toward ENB users. It is based entirely on DarkAngel13’s modifications to Bethesda’s NightEyeImod. \r\n\r\n\r\nV1.3.5\r\n- BeluaDisableSunglare added. Set this to 1 to disable sun image space modifiers being applied when taking sun damage. \r\n- BeluaDisableShrineGlare added. Set this to 1 to disable shrine image space modifiers being applied when taking sun damage.\r\n- Added message notification at start of taking shrine damage\r\n- Added audible notification at start of taking shrine damage\r\n- BeluaDisableShrineAlert added. Set this to 1 to disable the audible notification\r\n- Changed Shrine Damage from being a script executing on the playerref in the VampireQuest to a spell. Makes it MUCH easier to enable/disable and future enhancements won’t require a stop/restart of the main quest.\r\n- Fixed the carry weight modification spell not getting applied to Thrall’s automatically. Additional speed boost should work… but the perk placement on actors is acting a little funny. May or may not work as desired. \r\n- Renamed BeluaVampireSightPrimaryImodStrength to BeluaVampireSightIndoorImodStrength\r\n- Renamed BeluaVampireSightSecondaryImodStrength to BeluaVampireSightOutdoorImodStrength\r\n- Changed VampireSightMode default to 3 (this will only effect new games)\r\n- There are now nine different combinations for Vampires Sight along with an individual strength modifier for indoors and outdoors. \r\n- Improved Vampire’s Sight now dynamically changes between modes when going from indoors/outdoors (if using an option that supports it)\r\n- Tweaked Ianuea Magicae timing. Slow time kicks in sooner, added some more bats.\r\n- Added Visual Absorption effect from player to shrines when in proximity. Prepping to remove shrine glare altogether so BeluaDisableShrineGlare will be obsolete...probably by the time 1.3.5 releases....heck probably in beta 2.\r\n- Fixed broken Attack on Sight cloak. Guards WILL now attack you if you are at low enough satiation. I hope you enjoyed the reprieve. \r\n- Fixed Vampire Feed not counting feeds under certain conditions that it was intended to. \r\n- As a Sire you now have a certain sway over guards if your crimegold for their faction isn’t too terribly high. With a crime gold of less than or equal to 500 you can now have your crimes forgotten. If your crime gold is higher than that, you’ll have to live with the consequences of your actions, whatever they may be. Thanks to Alradaev0 for the suggestion. \r\n- Added BeluaUnequipWeaponsOnFeed – Some people’s system seem prone to getting their characters in a frozen state after feeding which is related to having weapons drawn during the animation. Setting this to 1 will unequip the weapons to help prevent this, but Skyrim has no function to re-equip the left hand weapon so only the right is re-equipped\r\n- Added BeluaUnequipWeaponsOnHarvest – Similar to feeding issue.\r\n- Removed Dependency on RaceCompatibility mod. This will allow us to push the mod to steam (if we decide to) and also reduces the chance of introducing CTDs if we forget to package Racecompatibility.esm in a future release. Don’t worry, this won’t have any effect on our supporting custom races that use RaceCompatibility.esm. \r\n- Determined a way to sheathe weapons before feeding and harvesting to assist with “stuck” prevention\r\n- Hunger Manager will update quest globals so that any time it’s called (Feeding, hearts, using Dark Gift) it will update the journal (almost immediately…within a few seconds)\r\n- Harvesting Hearts in front of guards is a crime (treated like feeding detection now)\r\n- Vampire’s Kiss is now implemented as a suggestion in top level dialogue that the NPC you’re talking to appears to be tired. If you select this dialogue branch it will auto cast Vampire’s Kiss for you. Thanks to Alradaev of the Nexus Forums for this suggestion.\r\n- Added BeluaMortalisVisualMode. Setting this to 0 will disable the visual glow effect when in mortal form. There may be additional modes in the future. Default 1.\r\n- Dark Elves have been given back some of their racial fire resistance. 20%. You may need to start a new use Sumo Mortalis Forma to switch out and then back for it to pick up, or worst case, start a new game if you’re already a Dark Elf Vampire.\r\n- Vampire Refuges have been added to Skyrim. They protect you during your sleep from vigilant bounty hunters, allow you to get more restful sleep in coffins, reducing the time for Satiation Stasis, and provide a place to store a limited number of items without having home ownership. \r\n- New documentation formatting. \r\n\r\n\r\nV1.3.4\r\n- Switched equip order on Feeding, Harvesting Hearts, and Progression. Left items will be equipped first, followed by right handed weapons, however…there is no way to properly re-equip the left AND right handed weapons in Skyrim. \r\n- Reworked Spell Refresh triggers so you no longer get another progression an hour after becoming a BSR Vampire\r\n- SpellResets and Progression/Regression refreshes will no longer kick in while in combat.\r\n- Spectral Axes will “charge up” their axe so that you see the enchantment glow on their axes after summoning. Dual Axes working but still only showing one axe until they enter combat.\r\n- Re-worked toggle script for Vampire’s Speed and stamina draining\r\n- Re-worked toggle script for Quasi Caligo and magicka draining\r\n- Removed “Breath of Frost” notification when progressing/regressing\r\n- MM_BeluaSanguinareRevisitedDialogueFixes now stops groaning from Spectral Axes. \r\n- Split SunDamageTracker into two separate spells. One tracks entering sun, one tracks leaving sun. This will help in cases where someone’s OnEffectFinish didn’t fire off previously leaving IsInSunlight turned on.\r\n- Darken and Dark Gift are now Lesser Powers. Thanks to Vince20100 for the suggestion. \r\n- Improvements in Quasi Caligo flying script. Can now hover in place. \r\n- Added IsRecoiling check to Vampire Staggered Feed perk. \r\n- Vampire’s Kiss can now only be used on the same NPCs that you can feed from. i.e. can’t cast Vampire’s Kiss on a Wolf or undead, or people carrying garlic.\r\n- Removed “Hidden in UI” checkbox from Speech Fortification\r\n- Added Vampire Feed Detection. This can dramatically improve your recognition of being a vampire in and around common areas, as well as trigger assault alarms by people that witness you feeding. \r\n- Modified AOS Cloak for better triggering and improvements\r\n- “Vampiric Command (Animal)” now becomes “Vampiric Command”. Use is the same, but can now be used on Thralls to release them. \r\n- If you thrall a living victim in their home or establishment, the cell ownership transfers to you. If you release them, the cell ownership now reverts back. If they die, you stay the owner.\r\n- Feed victims get a very minor and temporary boost to healrate for 1 hour to “heal over time”\r\n- Fixed a bad timing issue if you happened to feed while BSR quest was in the middle of updating.\r\n- Darken now restores Stamina as a Sire. \r\n- Sumo Mortalis Forma visual effect added while in mortal form\r\n- Thralls will immediately consider you a friend and will always consider you a friend even after releasing them\r\n- Much more tweaking in the Feed and Heart Harvest scripts\r\n- If you use BeluaVampireSprintImodStrength to apply the sprinting imagespace modifier, the modifier is now applied at a variable strength depending on your vampire level. At Sire it will apply at 100% strength as specified by BeluaVampireSprintImodStrength. At Fledgling on 20%.\r\n- Fixed a bug introduced in 1.3 Race Compatibility that kept vanilla vampire’s from becoming BSR vampires. \r\n- Added basic commands to Thralls. Open Inventory, Wait, Come, I release you. That sort of thing. This may not work when you first thrall an individual. I’ve noticed having to change locations to get this to fully hookup. \r\n- Modified script version debug notification to only show if there really was a script version change.\r\n- Thralls will get a speed boost to assist with keeping up\r\n- Thralls will get a slight boost in heal rate\r\n- Thralling should now work much more effectively. Requires a STOP and START of the main BSR Quest to hook certain alias references back up to the script and for speed boost/heal rate. Existing thralls will not work.\r\n\r\nV1.3.3\r\n- Removed Feed Attack/Talk when Activating a Staggered or Bleedout victim\r\n- Emergency fix for Sleep Feeding\r\nV1.3.2\r\n- Vampire’s Sprint speeds boosted back toward previous levels.\r\n- Vampire’s Sprint implementation re-worked. Again.\r\n- Removed Invisibility Archetype from Ianuae Magicae (Teleport)\r\n- Made some adjustments to the duration and amount of time Harvest Heart is applied to subjects. This has made it considerably less taxing on systems. \r\n- Also marked Harvest Hearts unable to be absorbed. Shouldn’t be a problem, since it’s an ability. \r\n- Fixed another Living Thrall bug\r\n- Fixed thrall follow package\r\n- Made a change to our Sunlight checker so that you will never be marked as in the sun when it’s raining.  I haven’t ever seen a “light” rain in Skyrim…at least vanilla, where it wasn’t overcast so it should always protect you. \r\n- Added message awareness if attempting to use Dark Gift while too hungry. You have to have at least enough satiation to cover the satiation damage that Dark Gift does for it to work.\r\n- Made Drain Lifeforce hostile\r\n- Feeding dispels Embrace of Shadows\r\n- Feeding locks most player controls, killing multi-feed spamming\r\n- Rumors Spread – The more feeding you do in cities, inns and taverns, the more likely you are to be hunted. \r\n- Removed Playable Flag on Redguard Vampire Race (it shouldn’t show up in race menu now)\r\n- Removed SpeedMult modifications to actors caught in Breath of Frost. It will now simply freeze them in place and do some frost damage.\r\n- Added four mods to Improved Vampire’s Sight. See customization section for full details.\r\n- Added mm_BeluaSanguinareRevisitedDialogueFixes.esp. This file begins to fix racial dialogues where previously you might have heard comments about being an Orc, or Argonian, but no longer because you are a Vampire. Not completed.\r\n- Disabled Ninja Feeding\r\n- Disabled Ninja Heart Harvesting (You know who you are ?)\r\n- Remove Speedmult and WeaponSpeedMult from Breath of Frost Spell Effect list\r\n- Racial Abilities last 15 real time minutes instead of 3 and 6 real time hours. \r\n- You are no longer considered in the Sun if you are in BlackReach during daylight hours regardless of the lightlevel.\r\n- Rehid certain racial effects timers that were turned on for debugging.\r\n- Added Weapon Dequip/Re-Equip to Harvest Hearts as another stuck player fix.\r\n- Added IsTeammate() check to AOS spell in case your teammate IS a guard. \r\n- Added Auto Embrace. Sneak and stay still in low enough light, don’t move, and you’ll automatically turn invisible after 6-10 seconds. Movement, getting into combat, being in a cut scene will cancel it out. “Set BeluaDisableAutoEmbrace to 1” to disable this. \r\n- Updated Sun Tracker spell to ignore all worldspaces where there is no “Sun”\r\n- Entirely reworked Belua’s main vampire quest script. Put HungerManager , Progression, and VampireFeed into their own spells. This allows for MUCH easier additions to hunger management, progression spells, and feed tweaks without the player having to stop and restart the main quest. \r\n- BeluaReverseSunDamage becomes BeluaSunDamageMode (makes more sense). No need to update your save if you changed this, the FormID is the same\r\n- Separated out Sun and Trespass damage. \r\n- Added BeluaTrespassDamageMode setting. Works similar to Sun Damage settings. \r\n- Fixed lowering Health, Stamina, and Magicka actor values while Trespassing (this should not have been the case). This largely accounts for quicker deaths when Trespassing than from Sun Damage.\r\n- Changed the time of day to start sun tracking from 5am to 6am. \r\n- Added BeluaDisableUndeadGroaning. Tired of those undead followers sounding like an army with dysentery? Only works when using the DialogueFix module. \r\n- Added BeluaDisableWolfAlly, BeluaDisableSkeeverAlly, BeluaDisableBearAlly, and BeluaDisableSabreAlly to control which animals will ally with you. \r\n- Fixed Red ImageSpace being applied with Darken Effect\r\n- Harvesting Hearts in or around cities, towns, and especially inns will also increase the rumor count\r\n- Hunger Manager will no longer kick in and re-add AttackOnSight effect to player if Sumo Mortalis Forma is in use. \r\n- Wrote a mm_BeluaDefault BAT file that can be used to reset Belua back to default settings, or modified for your own needs. \r\n- Added some additional effort around shrine damage implementation to make it more readily able to detect that it should be disabled. Ultimately this should probably just be a spell instead of an active script on the player.\r\n- Fixed documentation for BeluaHeartSatiationRestoreAmount. It was incorrectly documented as BeluaSatiationHeartRestoreAmount\r\n- Fixed Health Heart Satiation. It was supposed to provide satiation as well. \r\n- Added BeluaHealthyHeartMultiplier which allows for a multiplier applied to BeluaSatiationHeartRestoreAmount when eating a healthy heart. Default is 1.75. Two health hearts restore as much satiation as 3 damaged hearts. \r\n- Fixed Dual Casting of Spectralem Arma. When you dual cast, the creature will only show up wielding a single axe, but after engaging in combat, it will draw another axe.\r\n- Added Staggering Feed Attacks. If you encounter a staggered opponent, they are now vulnerable to attack and can be activated to feed upon. Recently added, limited testing.\r\n\r\nV1.3.1\r\n- Fixed a logic bug with using Vampire’s Kiss and Sneak Feeding which caused you to feed twice with potentially dire consequences\r\n- Most guards in the holds and other NPCs are actually given the race of “FoxRace”. Added FormsList checks for certain NPCs to identify proper race. Some may still be missing. \r\n\r\n- V1.3\r\n- Fixed up some code around Quasi Caligo and Embrace of Shadows potentially leaving people in a transparent state. \r\n- Casting Embrace of Shadows and then casting Ianuae Magicae would cause you to have permanent invisibility. I have re-worked both spells for resolution. \r\n- Changed default Potion Effectiveness for Masters and up from 0% to 5%. Hopefully this will allow certain quests to work by not fully negating the effectiveness. \r\n- OnUpdateGameTime now removes all vanilla vampirism effects each hour in case they sneak in\r\n- Removed Invisibility modifications from Ianuae Magicae script and moved to Effect Archetype\r\n- Re-wrote Vampire’s Sprint. Sprint is handled mostly through the effect now. Just potential visuals handled in the script. May remove the script entirely in future versions\r\n- Sires have a new ability when feeding “Absorb Racial Traits”. They will absorb the racial power and resistances/bonuses of people they feed on. \r\n- You can now thrall people that are your level or below. This is to allow people already at maximum level to thrall leveled NPCs that are also same level.\r\n- Tweaked Progression Animation Timing\r\n- Vampire’s Kiss provides a 33% increase in successfully Sneak Feeding if victim is under the influence\r\n- Frost Resistances provided at each level of Vampirism and Satiation (except Satiated)\r\n- Tweaked animation feeding, and now calling Game.SetPlayerAIDriven(false) whenever feed is complete as there is a timing bug in Bethesda\\'s VampireFeed animation which sometimes causes the game engine not to re-enable the player. This should prevent people from getting stuck.\r\n- Fixed bug which showed up after fixing 1.2.8 bug with Vampire Feed if you remained a vampire but when through uninstall. Could not feed.\r\n- Embrace of Shadows now only dispels if you’re hit in an attack, or if you attack someone, or enter the Sun. It will not dispel if you enter combat state.\r\n- Fixed Vampiric Step – It was only ever applied to Fledglings. Now applies to All levels and scales from 10% muffled movement to 100% as a Sire.\r\n- Added Script Versioning to BeluaVampireQuest script. This will trigger a refresh of spells based on your current vampire level in case spells have changed, or been added/removed in later versions of the mod WITHOUT resetting your stats. As a side effect you will see a message stating “You are now an XXXXXXX vampire”.  This will kick in within 1 game hour after loading a save. Hit “T” to force it. It will only fire one time. Afterwards the global value and the internal script value will be synchronized.\r\n- Added ability to force the reset of all spells from the console. Drop to console and do “Set BeluaResetSpells to 1”, then wait 1 game hour.\r\n\r\nV1.2.8\r\n- Fixed bug with BeluDisableSunAlert usage. Sun Alerts are on by default, this must be set to 1 to work now. Previously it worked in reverse\r\n- Fixed bug with Potion effectiveness being enabled, Lightfoot not being given, and RestoSpell effectiveness being enabled when they should not be.\r\n- Fixed bug with VampireFeed perk. This perk DOES had to be modified by BSR so that it would be disabled if the player is a BSR vampire as the perk cannot actually be removed if the player is a vampire.\r\n- Hiding Servi Immortui from the Effects List\r\n\r\nV1.2.7\r\n- Fixed crash bug with male Redguard\\'s when turning into BSR Vampires or using Sumo Forma Mortalis\r\n\r\nV1.2.6\r\n- Added BeluaDisableVampireSprint global. Setting this value to anything other than 0 will disable the vampire’s sprint speeds from being applied.\r\n- Tightened up some of the Vampire Sprint code to see if this would help (I don’t see that it will). Had to remove the extra boost you get after 2 seconds of sprinting. \r\n- Added BeluaEnablePotionEffectiveness global. Setting this value to anything other than 0 will enable potion effectiveness.  \r\n- Added BeluaDisableLightFoot global. Setting this value to anything other than 0 will disable the light foot perk for vampire’s allowing them to trigger traps at all times\r\n- Using Sumo Mortalis Forma will temporarily remove Vampire’s Light Foot\r\n- Updated BeluaReverseSunDamage. Setting this value to 2 will disable all adverse effects from the Sun for those that can’t hang with our implementation. Previously setting to 2 just disabled health damage. \r\n- Changed thrall level target requirement to be your level or lower rather than just lower than your level. \r\n- Cleaned up the progression animation. Removed the silly “Fall to the ground” with a better workaround to get out of the ascension animation. \r\n- Altered Water Walking now that 1.6 patch changes behavior. If you are sprinting you can walk on water (credit for idea goes to Shady_Sam of the Nexus Forums). \r\n- Sumo Forma Mortalis removes you temporarily from the BeluaVampireFaction. This will allow you to interact with certain Vigilant of Stendarr while under this form. \r\n- Made some tweaks to combat feeding to see if sending an animationevent would fix some people who get stuck. \r\n- Changed cooldown on Breath of Frost to 15 seconds\r\n- Removed Levelled item LItemVigilantRobes from MM_BeluaSangunaireRevisitedLootTables.esp\r\n\r\nV1.2.5\r\n- Fixed Progression bug\r\n- Fixed Sense Garlic\r\n\r\nV1.2.4\r\n- Added some optimization around Feeding/OnUpdate race conditions. Feeding now checks the script state and waits for the state to get out of busy if it is. Also feeding disables the update so it doesn\\'t occur during feeds.\r\n- Removed calls to BeluaFixup function in quest script. This has not been necessary to do since before the beta was released\r\n- Removed ghosting and visual art effects from Teleport Spell on reports from two individuals that they remained invisible. \r\n- Fixed missing Disease Resist. Some players have reported they had two resist diseases, so we took out adding resist disease but as it turns out, these players were playing vampires when they added the mod. In which case you get two, but if you were never a vampire you then got NO resist disease. To resolve both issues, we\\'re just going to re-add the Beth Resist Disease spell instead of our own. \r\n- Note: Resist Disease issue is likely why some people are getting the default vampirism quest started. They are getting re-infected with vanilla vampirism. We have measures to counter this in place now. \r\n- Added missing \\\"Embrace of Shadows\\\" spell. \r\n- Added global value BeluaDisableSunAlert. Setting this value to 1 will disable the audible alert when taking sun and/or trespassing damage.\r\n- Added update information to documentation\r\n- Making calls into Bethesda’s Vampire Quest script to override the LastFeedTime and VampireStatus values. This will prevent you from ever going hungry in the vanilla script. \r\n- Looping through the crimefactionslist that Bethesda uses in their Vampire Quest and removing the enemy flag from those factions. This is a temporary fix for people who are already experiencing the vanilla script marking AOS problem. Future versions (maybe 2 builds out) will not do this. I don’t like this workaround, but that’s how Bethesda manages part of the AttackOnSight in the vanilla script.\r\n- Removed hardcoded check against satiation being > 25 in progression logic to checking your stage. \r\n- Documented missed changes to Dark Sacrifice rewards\r\n- Removed a dirty edit on a MainMenuCell that appeared to cause the game to be “Brighter” as a whole. \r\n- OnUpdateScript checks to see if you’ve got a stuck SpeedTransitionGlobal and unsticks it. This is a temporary fix for Vampiric Evasion stopping. \r\n- Added audible and visual sound queues when casting Sumo Mortalis Forma\r\n- Added BeluaEnableRestorationEffectiveness which removes the restoration effectiveness penalties.\r\n\r\nv1.2.3\r\n- Totally busted Garlic and Harvest Heart with trying to fix brawls in 1.2.2. Had to back out brawl solution and implement new\r\n- Modified Sumo Mortalis Forma to temporarily remove Sense Garlic, and ability to Harvest Hearts when active\r\n- Modified Sumo Mortalis to take no magicka unless starving. \r\n- Sumo Mortalis Forma can now be used before brawls so that you aren\\'t seen as using magic even when you\\'re not\r\n- Modified Vampire\\'s Sprint so that it correctly returns you to proper speed if you were hit by a slowing spell (such as frost) while it was active.\r\n\r\nv1.2.2\r\n- Added ability to control how bright \\\"Improved Vampire\\'s Sight\\\" was. Use BeluaBrighterVampireSight to control the brightness between 0.0 and 1.0. To use, from the console type \\\"set BeluaBrighterVampireSight to 0.5\\\"\r\n- Added BeluaBrighterVampireSight to control brightness of Vampire’s Sight \r\n- Added BeluaDisableShrineDamage to control whether or not shrines damage player \r\n- Added BeluaDisableGarlicDamage to control whether or not garlic damages players \r\n- Added Unarmed Bonus Damages as you get hungrier (similar to 1H and 2H attack) \r\n- Allow Drain Lifeforce to be used on Animals\r\n- Added new global value, BeluaReverseSunDamage. This will cause Sun Damage to be stronger as a Fledgling and get progressively weaker until you\\'re a Sire.\r\n- Updated Journal to reflect sleeping requirement for progression and regression. \r\n- Had broken SatiationTitles in Journal when removing the Belua Holding Cell in 1.2 but this was unnoticed unless a new game was started. Recreated a new wilderness area that is inaccessible and put place holders for satiation titles there\r\n- Hopefully fixed AOS wonkiness when going starved. Guards would remember that they were attacking you if you came back non-AOS. Additionally, added ability to hide from guards. If they lose AOS for 30 seconds in a row, they’ll stop looking for you. This is only when AOS. \r\n- Added AOS visual effects to player that were missing due to naming conventions on script not being followed for packaging script\r\n- Added additional measures to ensure the default Player Vampire Quest script stays stopped. \r\n- Added BeluaVampireSprintImodStrength, controls the amount of radial blur when using Vampire Sprint. Default 0. \r\n- Added new global value, BeluaReverseSunDamage. This will cause Sun Damage to be stronger as a Fledgling and get progressively weaker as you become a Sire.\r\n- Hopefully squashed Brawls being interrupted for magic use\r\n\r\nv1.2.1\r\n- Optimized/Removed disable/enable player controls on Heart Harvesting and Feeding to remove potential race conditions that cause the player to be locked into position \r\n- Fixed QUEST/STATS being disabled in Journal Menu after harvesting a heart (bug introduced in 1.2) \r\n- Please use EPC 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 at the console to re-anable QUEST/STATS/JOURNAL menu if you were afflicted\r\n\r\nv1.2\r\n- Removed ability to become Belua Sanguinare Vampire if not using default races.This will prevent certain anamolies and game breaking issues, such as Forma, which rely on switching out classes. \r\n- Fixed Solitude Attack Bug. If you are a vampire and never been to solitude, the guards would attack you during the prisoner scene. \r\n- Fixed pale vampires. This was in the system previously, but got disabled at some point possibly after a system crash I had. \r\n- If you use Vampire\\'s Kiss and the victim dies, if they owned the bed they slept in, it will have no ownership.\r\n- If you use Vampire\\'s Kiss inside a residence they owned, and the victim dies, it will become yours. \r\n- If you Thrall a victim inside a residence they owned, it will transfer ownership to you.\r\n- Removed \\\"Belua Holding Cell\\\" from game\r\n\r\nv1.1\r\n- Fixed Sneak Feeding and Feed Attacks for some players. \r\n- Removed Blood Splatters when Feeding on sleeping victims, and sneak victims unless famished, ravenous, or starving.\r\n\r\nv1.0\r\n- Initial Public Offering\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nV1.3.6\r\n- Ghosts are no longer detected as living creatures with blood (Thanks Tylitalo)\r\n- Increased wait time to remove fall damage perk when in mist form to 3 seconds instead of 1 (Thanks zoneofdarkness)\r\n- Removed IsInCombat check on Quasie Caligo, and placed it in the spell script. This will allow you to de-activate the spell if you enter combat but do nothing if you’re already in combat and try to use it. (Thanks zoneofdarkness)\r\n- Removed Shrine Damage magic effect spell description in active effects (Thanks Glacious21)\r\n- Fixed standard cast Spectral Axes so they’ll attack now. Properly Dual Cast Spectral Axes still worked (Thanks Glacious21)\r\n- Fixed description on Breath of Frost (Thanks Glacious21)\r\n- Tweaked feed detection so it doesn’t apply to sleeping NPCs\r\n- Tweaked Vampire Feed script back to always calling SetPlayerAIDriven(false)\r\n- When under the effects of Sumo Mortalis Forma the following abilities are disabled:\r\n - Sense Garlic\r\n - Sense Undead/Dead\r\n - Sense Blood\r\n - Harvesting Hearts\r\n - Embrace of Shadows\r\n - Feeding (all forms)\r\n - All positive hunger based multipliers\r\n  - Critical Chance Multiplier\r\n  - 1H Weapon, 2H Weapon, and Unarmed Damage Multiplier\r\n  - Stamina Regen Multiplier\r\n- Removed IsCommandedActor and IsPlayerTeammate check from Vampire’s Kiss (Sorry Foxamakiir!) :)\r\n- Implemented Sunburning. Get your sunscreen out.  (Thanks Alradaev)\r\n- Fixed Stamina Drain on Vampire’s Speed\r\n- Moved Magicka drain to magic effects, instead of script based on Sumo Mortalis Forma when hungry.\r\n- Changed Toggle Implementation for Sumo Mortalis Forma and removed loud sound effect. \r\n- Modified magic so that certain effects are disabled when Sumo is active, rather than having it remove/re-add spells.\r\n- Fixed Refuges bug with Temple of the Divine Nine Doors point to Vampire Refuge in Riverwood.\r\n- Worked around some additional timing issues with feeding \r\n- Implemented Heart Decomposition. Every hour the system will have a fresh damaged heart decompose into a destroyed heart. It will also have a fresh heart to decompose into a damaged heart. If you have eaten a heart in the last hour, it will not decompose a heart of that type during the check. A heart preservation system will be put into place allowing you to preserve hearts. \r\n- If no bed can be found for the victim of vampire’s kiss, the victim will be forced to lie on the ground if they are not in combat. \r\n- Added BeluaDisableFleshBurning. If you don’t like the flesh burn effect on your character, setting this to 1 will keep it from occurring in the future. \r\n- Modified Bounty Hunter Quests so if they don’t track you down in 72 hours, the quest will auto-stop keeping it from getting in a stuck state where the hunters may have gone missing and never repeating again.\r\n- Added BeluaDisableSneakFeeding. Setting this to any value other than 0 will disable sneak feeding. \r\n- Added BeluaDisableUndeadThralling. Setting this to any value other than 0 will disable undead thralls as a result of feed kills. \r\n- Re-Wrote script version check so it happens automatically on player savegame load.\r\n- Spell Refreshes and script updates no longer have player go through progression/regression animations. Happens pretty quickly now. \r\n- Removed auto attack feeding and prefixed all Belua Sanguinare Revisited feeds with “BSR “, in preperation for Dawnguard. \r\n- Removed overwrite of Bethesda’s VampireFeed perk in preperation for Dawnguard\r\n- Heal rates of feed victims boosted from 1 hour to 24 hours. \r\n- Feed Counts now only apply to unique victims in a 24 hour period while not in combat. Satiation level no longer matters.\r\n- Implemented BeluaRottingHeartTime global value. This sets, in hours, the amount of time that must go by before a heart rots/decays. \r\n- Added Cure Disease every hour in HungerManager to counter vanilla 100% disease resistant bug where you can still catch diseases. This is a bug in vanilla skyrim. Added info to Known Issues. \r\n- Drain Lifeforce now scales damage based on destruction level and vampire rank. Range varies now varies between 2.4/sec as a Fledgling with 10 destruction and 30/sec as a Sire with 100 Destruction.\r\n- Added another Night Eye Image Space, this one specifically geared toward ENB users. It is based entirely on DarkAngel13’s modifications to Bethesda’s NightEyeImod. \r\n\r\n\r\nV1.3.5\r\n- BeluaDisableSunglare added. Set this to 1 to disable sun image space modifiers being applied when taking sun damage. \r\n- BeluaDisableShrineGlare added. Set this to 1 to disable shrine image space modifiers being applied when taking sun damage.\r\n- Added message notification at start of taking shrine damage\r\n- Added audible notification at start of taking shrine damage\r\n- BeluaDisableShrineAlert added. Set this to 1 to disable the audible notification\r\n- Changed Shrine Damage from being a script executing on the playerref in the VampireQuest to a spell. Makes it MUCH easier to enable/disable and future enhancements won’t require a stop/restart of the main quest.\r\n- Fixed the carry weight modification spell not getting applied to Thrall’s automatically. Additional speed boost should work… but the perk placement on actors is acting a little funny. May or may not work as desired. \r\n- Renamed BeluaVampireSightPrimaryImodStrength to BeluaVampireSightIndoorImodStrength\r\n- Renamed BeluaVampireSightSecondaryImodStrength to BeluaVampireSightOutdoorImodStrength\r\n- Changed VampireSightMode default to 3 (this will only effect new games)\r\n- There are now nine different combinations for Vampires Sight along with an individual strength modifier for indoors and outdoors. \r\n- Improved Vampire’s Sight now dynamically changes between modes when going from indoors/outdoors (if using an option that supports it)\r\n- Tweaked Ianuea Magicae ti",

      "changelogHtml": " Thralling should now work much more effectively. Requires a STOP and START of the main BSR Quest to hook certain alias references back up to the script and for speed boost/heal rate. Existing thralls will not work. <br/> \n Thralls will get a slight boost in heal rate <br/> \n Thralls will get a speed boost to assist with keeping up <br/> \n Modified script version debug notification to only show if there really was a script version change. <br/> \n Added basic commands to Thralls. Open Inventory, Wait, Come, I release you. That sort of thing. This may not work when you first thrall an individual. I’ve noticed having to change locations to get this to fully hookup. <br/> \n Fixed a bug introduced in 1.3 Race Compatibility that kept vanilla vampire’s from becoming BSR vampires.  <br/> \n If you use BeluaVampireSprintImodStrength to apply the sprinting imagespace modifier, the modifier is now applied at a variable strength depending on your vampire level. At Sire it will apply at 100% strength as specified by BeluaVampireSprintImodStrength <br/> \n Much more tweaking in the Feed and Heart Harvest scripts <br/> \n Thralls will immediately consider you a friend and will always consider you a friend even after releasing them <br/> \n Sumo Mortalis Forma visual effect added while in mortal form <br/> \n Darken now restores Stamina as a Sire. <br/> \n Fixed a bad timing issue if you happened to feed while BSR quest was in the middle of updating. <br/> \n Feed victims get a very minor and temporary boost to healrate for 1 hour to “heal over time” <br/> \n If you thrall a living victim in their home or establishment, the cell ownership transfers to you. If you release them, the cell ownership now reverts back. If they die, you stay the owner. <br/> \n “Vampiric Command (Animal)” now becomes “Vampiric Command”. Use is the same, but can now be used on Thralls to release them. <br/> \n Modified AOS Cloak for better triggering and improvements <br/> \n Added Vampire Feed Detection. This can dramatically improve your recognition of being a vampire in and around common areas, as well as trigger assault alarms by people that witness you feeding.  <br/> \n Removed “Hidden in UI” checkbox from Speech Fortification <br/> \n Vampire’s Kiss can now only be used on the same NPCs that you can feed from. i.e. can’t cast Vampire’s Kiss on a Wolf or undead, or people carrying garlic. <br/> \n Added IsRecoiling check to Vampire Staggered Feed perk. <br/> \n Improvements in Quasi Caligo flying script. Can now hover in place. <br/> \n Darken and Dark Gift are now Lesser Powers. Thanks to Vince20100 for the suggestion.  <br/> \n Split SunDamageTracker into two separate spells. One tracks entering sun, one tracks leaving sun. This will help in cases where someone’s OnEffectFinish didn’t fire off previously leaving IsInSunlight turned on. <br/> \n MM_BeluaSanguinareRevisitedDialogueFixes now stops groaning from Spectral Axes. <br/> \n Removed “Breath of Frost” notification when progressing/regressing <br/> \n Re-worked toggle script for Quasi Caligo and magicka draining <br/> \n Re-worked toggle script for Vampire’s Speed and stamina draining <br/> \n Spectral Axes will “charge up” their axe so that you see the enchantment glow on their axes after summoning. Dual Axes working but still only showing one axe until they enter combat. <br/> \n SpellResets and Progression/Regression refreshes will no longer kick in while in combat. <br/> \n Reworked Spell Refresh triggers so you no longer get another progression an hour after becoming a BSR Vampire <br/> \n Switched equip order on Feeding, Harvesting Hearts, and Progression. Left items will be equipped first, followed by right handed weapons, however…there is no way to properly re-equip the left AND right handed weapons in Skyrim.  <br/> \n",

Range varies now varies between 2.4/sec as a Fledgling with 10 destruction and 30/sec as a Sire with 100 Destruction. <br/> \n Added another Night Eye Image Space, this one specifically geared toward ENB users.

While kind of fun, harvesting hearts from your freshly dead but reanimated thralls was not intended. <br/> \n •\tChanged Restoration Effectiveness from 0% (Masters and above) to 0.01% so that effects that rely on restoration spells that need to take effect for certain quests will work.  <br/> \n Worked around some additional timing issues with feeding  <br/> \n Implemented Heart Decomposition. Every hour the system will have a fresh damaged heart decompose into a destroyed heart and healthy hearts into damaged ones <br/> \n If no bed can be found for the victim of vampire’s kiss, the victim will be forced to lie on the ground if they are not in combat.  <br/> \n Added BeluaDisableFleshBurning. If you don’t like the flesh burn effect on your character, setting this to 1 will keep it from occurring in the future.  <br/> \n Modified Bounty Hunter Quests so if they don’t track you down in 72 hours, the quest will auto-stop keeping it from getting in a stuck state where the hunters may have gone missing and never repeating again. <br/> \n Added BeluaDisableSneakFeeding. Setting this to any value other than 0 will disable sneak feeding.  <br/> \n Added BeluaDisableUndeadThralling. Setting this to any value other than 0 will disable undead thralls as a result of feed kills.  <br/> \n Re-Wrote script version check so it happens automatically on player savegame load. <br/> \n Spell Refreshes and script updates no longer have player go through progression/regression animations. Happens pretty quickly now.  <br/> \n Removed auto attack feeding and prefixed all Belua Sanguinare Revisited feeds with “BSR “, in preperation for Dawnguard.  <br/> \n Removed overwrite of Bethesda’s VampireFeed perk in preperation for Dawnguard <br/> \n Heal rates of feed victims boosted from 1 hour to 24 hours.  <br/> \n Feed Counts now only apply to unique victims in a 24 hour period while not in combat. Satiation level no longer matters. <br/> \n Implemented BeluaRottingHeartTime global value. This sets, in hours, the amount of time that must go by before a heart rots/decays. <br/> \n Added Cure Disease every hour in HungerManager to counter vanilla 100% disease resistant bug where you can still catch diseases. This is a bug in vanilla skyrim. Added info to Known Issues.  <br/> \n Drain Lifeforce now scales damage based on destruction level and vampire rank. Range varies now varies between 2.4/sec as a Fledgling with 10 destruction and 30/sec as a Sire with 100 Destruction. <br/> \n Added another Night Eye Image Space, this one specifically geared toward ENB users.

If you don’t have dawnguard, it should still work like normal. <br/> \n Fixed a “Getting stuck when in the sunlight” problem…you couldn’t move and would constantly raise your hands to your brow as if shielding your eyes from the sun….it was nice…but wasn’t intended for release and wasn’t completed. <br/> \n Fixed typo in mm_BeluaDefaults.  <br/> \n The BSR Quest Manager now gives back Vampire’s Seduction immediately after removing vanilla vampire spells if you have Dawnguard. If you don’t have dawnguard, no change.  <br/> \n Fixed Sneak Bug where you were frozen in place if the sneak check failed <br/> \n You will not be detected in sunlight when the current weather is the Dawnguard Eclipse, or Auriel’s Bow “Cloudy Weather” effect. If you are taking sun damage and the weather transitions to this state at the same time, it may not work. <br/> \n Fixed Sneak Attack Feed Animations breaking for DG users <br/> \n Removed All Racial Edits from main BSR module.  <br/> \n Removes Acitvation Blocker from Vampire Lord (May have to wait about 10 seconds after switching into it for it to work) <br/> \n •\tAdded Belua Sanguinare Revisisted Configuration Spell.

This will summon a helper to configure some of the Belua Sanguinare Settings. <br/> \n Changed MagicVampireDrain keyword on Drain Lifeforce spell to mm_BeluaMagicVampireDrain and altered magnitude modifier perk as well. This will keep it from interfering with Vampire Lord’s magnitude.  <br/> \n You can now always successfully Sneak Feed on Vampire Cattle <br/> \n Feeding on Vampire Cattle will not trigger “Feed Detection” cloak any longer. This was not reported as a problem, but seems to be a good measure.  <br/> \n Added BeluaEnableVampireLordUnblocker to control whether or not unblocking activation capability of Vampire Lord is enabled. <br/> \n Added BeluaDisableVampireAssistant to disable the Vampire Assistant and ultimately remove spell from player. <br/> \n Added BeluaDisableMortalisRaceChange to control whether or not you change races when using Sumo Mortalis Forma.  <br/> \n Fixed a problem where you could not get into Vampire Lord form in earlier versions of 1.3.7 Beta due to way Activation Blocker was being disabled.  <br/> \n Fixed an issue with inadvertently removing VampireVampirism ability (Disease Resist). This ability will not be removed as part of the vanilla abilities.  <br/> \n Certain BSR Spells and Lesser Powers are now available in Vampire Lord form, based on your Vampire Rank.  <br/> \n Setting BeluaVampireSightMode to 100 will cause the standard VampireHunterSight spell to be cast, providing support for alternate  <br/> \n No longer removing standard Vampire Sight.  <br/> \n As a Vampire Lord you will have access to most all your Vampire Powers when walking, and to all of your Spells and Powers when levitating.  <br/> \n Removed Rotting Hearts Effect from UI/Active Effects <br/> \n If you’re in levitate mode of Vampire Lord you will be protected from falling damage. <br/> \n",
