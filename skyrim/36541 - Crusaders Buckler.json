  "descriptionHtml": "I have a few crusader mods installed just for role playing purposes and lacked a certain footsoldier shield which I thought retexture myself to fill this little gap. \r\n\r\nI came up with this little shield retexture and also decided to share.\r\n\r\nIt can be found outside the Temple of Talos which is the closest thing to a church in Skyrim.\r\n\r\nThis could simply be used for footsoldiers or perhaps your prime, favorite shield.\r\n\r\nTexture does need work and is a bit bright... also needs a normal map thing..\r\n\r\nIts standalone and does not replace any vanilla texture.\r\n\r\n",
