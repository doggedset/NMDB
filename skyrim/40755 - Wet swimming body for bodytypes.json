  "descriptionHtml": "Warning: I&#39;ve integrated this feature in the new version of Bodytypes of Skyrim (v2.61), so this file isn&#39;t necessary and can cause issues. Use only with old versions.\r<br />\r<br />[color=red][b][size=4]New version for BodyTypes v2[/size][/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />This version is compatible with the latest version of BodyTypes, and can work fine with &#34;wet & cold&#34; mod by Isoku.\r<br />\r<br />I have plans to integrate this feature in &#34;bodytypes&#34; mod, but I&#39;m thinking of a better alternative with less complexity, scripts, etc.\r<br />Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t got the necessary skills in texture modding to do it...\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Description[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds a body with wet look to be used when swimming or rainy weather.\r<br />Includes a normal version, nevernude, tanned and muscular, with a different body type for each race.\r<br />\r<br />It uses textures by xs2reality: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28946//?]Sporty Sexy Sweat - wet body skin texture[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Note: this mod does not contain nude textures, but becomes a nudity mod in combination with Crafting BodyTypes.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]How it works?[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />You have two options:\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Option 1[/size]\r<br />\r<br />The idea is to use wet body as &#34;Swim Gear&#34; for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/38403//?]Town - Wilderness - Swimming outfit change[/url], created by Cmod and uploaded by goldigger1990.\r<br />\r<br />Download and install &#34;Town - Wilderness - Swimming outfit change&#34; (see his instructions). \r<br />Note: need SKSE to run.\r<br />\r<br />Install [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/40280//?]BodyTypes of Skyrim[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Install &#34;Wet swimming body for bodytypes v1.1&#34; copying &#34;Data&#34; to Skyrim directory and activating BodyTypesWet.esp file with NMM.\r<br />\r<br />When you load the game for the first time, the character appears naked, then equip the armor you want to use regularly.\r<br />Craft a wet body in the smithy, and go to a place where the character can swim. Then, the script unequip armor and character are naked again, now, equip the wet body, and will be remembered every time you enter the water.\r<br />Coming out of the water, the armor will be equipped after a while.\r<br />\r<br />Note: If you don&#39;t have SKSE installed, you can use bodies like any other body armor, without auto change.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Option 2[/size]\r<br />\r<br />SKSE needed\r<br />\r<br />Install Wet swimming bodies 2.0 like version 1.1, but not use &#34;Town - Wilderness - Swimming outfit change&#34; at the same time.\r<br />This is a new release based on spells. Add some spells with limited duration to change body skin when swimming, rainy weather...\r<br />\r<br />Spell tomes are located in a chest near a table in Riverwood&#39;s sawmill (see picture).\r<br />\r<br />There are two spell types: for swimming and for rainy weather (Rain spell 1 hour real time, player swimming 5 min, and NPCs 10 min).\r<br />When you cast the spell, effects only are activated if conditions are right (Rainnig, swimming, exterior location...)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Features:\r<br />\r<br />4 different Spells for player swimming, and 4 for NPCs.\r<br />\r<br />2 spells to equip a raincoat when it&#39;s rainning (also for NPCs).\r<br />\r<br />5 spells to equip wet bodies to be used with armor parts when it&#39;s rainning\r<br />\r<br />Males are supported, but only nude if you have installed a nude mod (wet specular texture only).\r<br />\r<br />Beast races too, but argonian with default skin.\r<br />\r<br />NPCs unequip/equip their armor when enter/leave water. Be carefull, followers are vulnerable in these situations.\r<br />\r<br />Player bodies and raincoats are non replacer, armor remains equipped but unseen. If you want more realism, unequip armor manually before entering water. (Bikini version replace 44 to 61 slots, to avoid overlapping with complements, others bodies only 59, 60 & 61)\r<br />\r<br />When rain stop or leave water, armor reappears after a while. Exception: player&#39;s helmets and hooded robes must be equipped manually.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Uninstall[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Delete installed files.\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall Cmod&#39;s mod.\r<br />\r<br />Recommended to eliminate all active effects and savegame before disabling and deleting files.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Notes[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />I have reduced textures size to prevent freezing when the script loads the body. If you have a powerful computer, you can download and replace with original textures by xs2reality.\r<br />\r<br />You can use complement with the wet body to complete the swim gear.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][size=4]Credits[/size][/b]\r<br />\r<br />xs2reality for wet textures and help\r<br />\r<br />titomead for male version idea\r<br />\r<br />Cmod and goldigger1990 for create and upload the outfit change mod",
