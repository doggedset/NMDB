  "descriptionHtml": "[color=gold][b][size=+1]See here for alternative:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11260[/size][/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[s][b][i][center][color=red][size=+1]This mod is not turning out the way I had intended, and I apologise for it. I am in the process of creating a custom race using their own textures so that you can have beautiful blue colours and Skyrim\\'s argonians will remain untouched. Apologies for the delay, I have to manually edit every race-checking line of dialogue and also every equippable item in the game to make my race fully integrated. It should be done soon. Stay tuned for more. I changed the version of this mod so that you may be alerted to the status of my upcoming solution.[/size][/color][/center][/i][/b][/s]\r\n\r\nArgonian Colours (Formerly Blue Argonians, now set to include many shades of colour)\r\n\t      by Mayfly53\r\n\r\nv 2.0b\r\n\r\nThis version of Blue Argonians has no dependancies and will not conflict with any mods. \r\nUsing the brilliance of the Construction Set, I added new skin tones to the Race Selection Menu.\r\nSelect your colour using the console command \\\"showracemenu\\\".\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is a beta version of what is to come. Beta usually translates to \\\"buggy\\\", but this is simply a precursor to the real thing. No bugs, just a limited selection of colours, some not very nice visually.\r\n\r\nI\\'m working on adding nice colours, but it\\'s difficult to judge what they will turn out like without testing, so it\\'ll be a little while before I get it right, and when I do I\\'ll add a dazzling array of skin tones!\r\n\r\nRecommended to be used with a HD skin texture, such as those by Xenius.\r\n\r\nCompatible with all mods; no dependancies.\r\n\r\n*Installation:\r\nUse NMM, or extract to Skyrim\\'s /Data folder.\r\n\r\n*Uninstallation:\r\nUse NMM, or delete Argonian Colours.esp.\r\n\r\n*Changelog:\r\nv2.1s: Link to alternative mod added.\r\n\r\nv2.1b: No change; alert to the lack of progress on this mod, and the upcoming solution in the form of a custom race, in another mod.\r\n\r\nv 2.0b: Testing new esp file to add true colour selection.\r\n\r\nv1.1: Added female textures.\r\n      Added patch for male chin spikes.\r\n\r\nv1.0: Initial release.\r\n      Male only.",
