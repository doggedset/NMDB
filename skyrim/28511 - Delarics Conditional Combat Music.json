  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://espurist.com/DCCM-Logo22.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][url=http://www.skyrimgems.com][img]http://i.imgur.com/1wXSO.png[/img][/url][/center]\r\n\r\nThis mod is very simple, it makes combat music only play when you are fighting certain enemies.  The enemies depend on which version you download (more versions available possibly upon request).  I got tired of hearing combat music when fighting the ubiquitous wolves and mud crabs and slaughterfish and whatever else.  This mod adds to the tension in the game as you will now no longer be \\\"alerted\\\" when being attacked by a lesser enemy, instead the combat music will only play when you are fighting something dangerous and tough (at least, something that is supposed to be dangerous and tough).\r\n\r\n[color=red]DRAGON RESERVED FILE IS NOW FIXED.  If you use the Dragon Reserved version please download the new file, get rid of the old one.  Thanks![/color]\r\n\r\n[b]News:[/b] \r\n[list]\r\n[*]The Dragon Reserved version has been updated to 0.81 and has been fixed.  There was a problem in the conditions logic.  Users should download the fixed file and remove the old one as it did not work properly.  Apologies to the users for that mix-up, hope you continue to use the mod and enjoy it.  Thanks!\r\n[*]I have now added an .esp for compatibility with [color=blue][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13286]Personalized Music[/url][/color], the non-replacer version.  This is a dragon-reserved version.  The Personalized Music mod must be downloaded as normal in addition to the file for this mod that pertains to Personalized Music.  Please note that I have added compatibility for the NON-replacer version, but it may in fact work with the replacer version.\r\n[*]\r\n[*]Now there is a [color=red]\\\"Dragon Reserved\\\"[/color] version which prevents dragon music for playing for creatures other than dragons.  With this file, like in the vanilla game, dragons have their own combat music.  This file is just like the Standard version otherwise, and is found next to the Standard version under Main in the Files section.\r\n[*]\r\n[*]Now compatible with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28583]Fantasy Music Overhaul Redone[/url].  You must first download FMOR, and then download the appropriate .esp file (Replacer or Non-Replacer) from the files for this mod.  Install FMOR, and then instead of the FMOR .esp use the .esp for this mod.  I think you can also use the FMOR .esp as long as you load the .esp for this mod AFTER, but it\\'s easier to just use one file.  This compatibility patch is brand new so report back if music is not playing properly.  Nothing permanent will happen to your game with this mod, it just alters how the game decides to play music when it is active.  So, feel free to download and use.  I expect it to work properly, but please get back to me and let me know if it doesn\\'t.  \r\n[*]\r\n[*][color=FF0000]For those interested in further reducing warnings from animals, try my mod [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28710]No Wolf Howl[/url], which stops wolves from howling when the player comes near.[/color]\r\n[*]\r\n[*][b]Version 0.80 available:[/b] The files have been updated with a fix for the music stopping bug.  You may notice that in a prolonged battle with a creature who does not receive vanilla combat music the music in the background will fade to silence.  This is normal, and whatever background music will resume when you are no longer in combat.  Also combat music for creatures who [i]do[/i] receive combat music may last for a few seconds after the combat is over, this is also normal.  I have tested the new version and found it to be working well, but let me know if you experience issues.\r\n\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[b][u]Standard Version:[/u][/b]\r\nDragons\r\nDragon Priests\r\nSpriggan Matrons\r\nFrost Atronachs\r\nStorm Atronachs\r\nDwarven Centurions\r\nGiants\r\nGiant Spiders\r\nMammoths\r\nTrolls\r\n\r\n[b][u]Humanoid Version:[/u] (by request)[/b]\r\nDragons\r\nDragon Priests\r\nSpriggan Matrons\r\nFrost Atronachs\r\nStorm Atronachs\r\nDwarven Centurions\r\nGiants\r\nGiant Spiders\r\nMammoths\r\nTrolls\r\nHumanoids/NPCs\r\n\r\n[b][u]Most Epic Version:[/u][/b]\r\nDragons\r\nDragon Priests\r\nStorm Atronachs\r\nDwarven Centurions\r\nGiants\r\n\r\n[b][u]DnDP Version:[/u] (by request)[/b]\r\nDragons\r\nDragon Priests\r\n\r\n[b][u]Humanoid Special Version:[/u] (by request)[/b]\r\n[i]This file is under \\'miscellaneous\\' in the file section[/i]\r\nDragons\r\nDragon Priests\r\nSpriggan Matrons\r\nGiants\r\nHumanoids/NPCs\r\n\r\n[b]Installation:[/b]\r\nThe file contains only one .esp so either do it the simple way with NMM or download manually and extract the .esp file to your Skyrim data folder.  Then enable the mod.  Make sure to load this .esp AFTER any other mods which add/replace music.\r\n\r\nTo uninstall, disable the mod.\r\n\r\n[b]Compatibility[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Now compatible with [color=blue]Personalized Music[/color], the non-replacer version!  See the News section and Optional Files section for the file.\r\n\r\n[b]Now compatible with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28583]Fantasy Music Overhaul Redone![/url][/b] See \\'Files\\' section.\r\n\r\nThis mod is compatible with base Skyrim, but does not necessarily cover any of the new creatures in Dawnguard or the Dragonborn DLCs.  The mod operates off of race keywords, some of which I made specifically for this mod and may not be applied to certain creatures in the DLCs.  Of course, I have Dawnguard and I plan to take care of the issue when I have time, so look for that coming up.\r\n\r\nAlso users may experience issues if you have a lot of custom creatures in your game or enemies that may use non-standard races or be based off of races that are not part of vanilla Skyrim.  I would suggest loading this mod after any creature-altering mods so that the proper keywords are added to the enemy races.  This does not alter anything about enemies except for adding a keyword, and even then only for some of them.  Let me know if you experience issues.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n[b]Changelog:[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]0.80[/i]\r\nfixed music stopping bug, slightly alters timing of music\r\n\r\n[i]0.75[/i]\r\nInitial release",
