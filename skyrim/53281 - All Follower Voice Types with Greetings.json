  "descriptionHtml": "=========\r<br />Why Install?\r<br />==========\r<br />The vanilla Skyrim has only a few voice types that are compatible to be a follower.\r<br />With this mod, all voice types can be recruited as follower. Now you can recruit any Whiterun Guard or use the Populated Lands mod and recruit random travelers&#33;\r<br />I also included BAT files which lessen the hassle and the follower autoheal too.\r<br />\r<br />============\r<br />Compatibility\r<br />=============\r<br />I added more voice types through Creation kit but for some reason it doesn&#39;t work with UFO.\r<br />\r<br />FIXED- I added a followufo bat command so it can work with UFO. Only use that if you have Ultimate Follower Overhaul, otherwise use the follow bat command.\r<br />=============\r<br />Installation\r<br />=============\r<br />Place into your Data folder all files.\r<br />Enable the esp.\r<br />\r<br />=====================\r<br />What are the txt files?\r<br />=====================\r<br />They are simple bat commands that can be used in game to make someone a follower.\r<br />\r<br />===============================\r<br />Q: How to make someone a follower?\r<br />================================\r<br />A: Simply, open up the console using the tilde key (~).\r<br />\r<br />Click on the desired NPC, make sure its clicked by double clicking on it.\r<br />\r<br />Type &#34;bat follow&#34; without the parentheses to make someone a follower, use the &#34;bat followufo&#34; if you have ultimate follower overhaul or if the person says you already have someone with you.\r<br />\r<br />If you don&#39;t like them anymore, and wish to give back their old jobs/scripts, simply dismiss them and use &#34;bat unfollow&#34; on them.\r<br />\r<br />=====================\r<br />Advantages of this mod\r<br />=====================\r<br />Every NPC you use the bat commands on will now Auto Heal outside of combat, which is my mod NPC Auto Heal, I combined with the .ESP\r<br />\r<br />I also left the greetings so they wouldn&#39;t be COMPLETELY silent. And I left everything else, so they would react to environment and if someone is dead and so on. \r<br />\r<br />=========================================================\r<br />Q: Help, my follower is not helping me fight, he is standing there.\r<br />=========================================================\r<br />A: Do not worry, this happened to me too, just wait for a minute or so, and the follower scripts should kick in, I recommend going inside an interior or saving game and loading it.",
