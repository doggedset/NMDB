No DLC required&#33;\r<br />\r<br />The new books have been scattered around the world. There are 26 pieces for you to collect (or sell for a fair price)&#33; These are obviously, not the complete writings, but very short excerpts (two or three pages) that I felt were interesting, funny, significant or insightful. Most of these are in the public domain, but some are not. Their authors have been listed in the &#34;permission and credits&#34; section.\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s the complete list of books included:\r<br />\r<br />01 - 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea \r<br />02 - A Tale of Two cities \r<br />03 - Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland \r<br />04 - Catcher in the Rye\r<br />05 - Charlotte&#39;s Web \r<br />06 - David Copperfield\r<br />07 - Don Quixote\r<br />08 - Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\r<br />09 - Frankenstein\r<br />10 - Gulliver&#39;s Travels \r<br />11 - Hamlet \r<br />12 - Journey to the Center of the Earth\r<br />13 - Little Women\r<br />14 - Lord of the Flies\r<br />15 - Moby Dick\r<br />16 - Romeo and Juliet\r<br />17 - The Great Gatsby\r<br />18 - The Lord of the Rings, Vol I\r<br />19 - The Red Badge of Courage\r<br />20 - The Scarlet Letter\r<br />21 - The Time Machine\r<br />22 - The Wind in the Willows\r<br />23 - To Kill a Mockingbird\r<br />24 - War and Peace\r<br />25 - Tom Sawyer\r<br />26 - Huckleberry Finn\r<br />\r<br />The books have custom textures made by Axhoff. They can be found [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12884/]here[/url] and look great when placed in order in a bookshelf&#33; Check the pictures to see.\r<br />\r<br />If you are having trouble finding the books, I&#39;ve listed their locations in the Readme section of the mod page. Of course, the idea is to find them&#33; But if you&#39;re stumped for whatever reason or just want them NOW, be sure to check over there.\r<br />\r<br />To install, place the files in your &#39;SteamSteamAppsCommonSkyrimData&#39; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Have fun reading&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
