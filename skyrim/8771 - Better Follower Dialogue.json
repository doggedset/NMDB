  "modName": "Better Follower Dialogue",
  "summary": "Small mod that Modifies your followers dialogue options:\r\n\r\nRemoves or moves Thane and Housecarl questions after the first time they\\'re asked depending on which option you want.\r\n\r\nRe-orders the dialogue options.\r\n\r\nAllows you to give your dog commands the same as you do with other followers.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod allows you to either remove the \\\"Thane\\\" and \\\"Housecarl\\\" topics in your followers dialogue list or move them to their own topic. It includes an option to re-order the topic list to something I felt was more suitable for common actions. It also allows you to issue commands to your dog just like you would a humanoid follower e.g. Move there, attack that, pick up that etc. Yes... he can be told to pick up items and put them in his inventory but I didn\\'t enable him to be used as a pack mule (Seemed a bit unrealistic). \r\n\r\nIncludes installer for NMM - If installing manually please make sure to only use the contents of ONE folder.\r\n\r\n[color=red]IF YOU HAVE A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS MOD ALREADY INSTALLED PLEASE UNINSTALL IT BEFORE INSTALLING V1.1[/color] \r\n\r\nTHE STRUCTURE OF THE FILES HAS CHANGED AND IT WILL CAUSE ISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nUse NMM and it will walk you through installation allowing you to choose the options you want.\r\n\r\nTo install manually copy the contents of ONE of the folders to your \\\"skyrim\\\\data\\\" directory and check them in the data files part of the launcher.\r\n\r\nYou will probably get a warning about missing content when you start your game. You can ignore this. It will not show up again once you\\'ve re-saved.\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\n\r\nTo uninstall either use NMM or delete any of the following files that exist in your \\\"Skyrim\\\\Data\\\" directory\r\n\r\nBetter Follower Dialogue-All.esp\r\nBetter Follower Dialogue-All.bsa\r\nBetter Follower Dialogue-All.bsl\r\nBetter Follower Dialogue-Thane.esp\r\nBetter Follower Dialogue-Thane.bsa\r\nBetter Follower Dialogue-Thane.bsl\r\nBetter Follower Dialogue-Remove.esp\r\nBetter Follower Dialogue-Reorder.esp\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\nv1.0 Note\r\n\r\nThere was an extra file in this version that changed Lydia\\'s \\\"Burdens\\\" line so if you installed manually and used the esp file named \\\"Better Follower Dialogue.esp\\\" the file may still remain if you use the NMM to install/upgrade to a new version afterwards. \r\n\r\nThe NMM installer does not know about this file so it could cause a conflict when left behind. It will probably have a conflict with the main file \\\"Better Follower Dialogue-All.esp\\\" as well since they change most of the same things.\r\n\r\nRemove from Skyrim\\\\Data manually if needed \r\n*****\r\n\r\nCredit to Aghast1981 for the idea to allow an option to move the dialogue instead of removing it.\r\n\r\nComments and suggestions are welcome\r\n\r\nKjodrisc\r\n\r\n",
