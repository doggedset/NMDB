  "summary": "Adds a Miniature Dragon Follower to accompany you in your travels",
  "descriptionHtml": "Briinah, Meaning &#34;Sister&#34; in the Dragon Tongue, is a Miniature Dragon that can be recruited to follow you about Tamriel.\r<br />\r<br />As she is such a small dragon, her flight is not yet developed, and thus she travels on the ground behind you.\r<br />\r<br />Briinah possesses the ability to use shouts, as all dragons do, and will use them to aid you in combat.\r<br />\r<br />She carries a flute that may be used to magically grant her flight, but the magic isn&#39;t always perfect. This flute may also take away her flight, should it be so desired.\r<br />\r<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />Briinah is finished to the best of my ability. As my first Skyrim Creation Kit project, she may not be perfect, but she is functional.\r<br />\r<br />She can be found at the main top the Whiterun Watchtower, sitting on the edge. Watch out for Dragons&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Keep in mind, since Dragons are not meant to be actual followers, some scripts may break. In these cases it&#39;s best to reload the most recent save. Briinah is [u][i][b]Fully functional[/b][/i][/u] in combat.\r<br />\r<br />I give permission for anyone to modify this mod to fit their likes, but they may NOT upload the changes.\r<br />DO NOT reupload this file anywhere else, without explicit permission from me.\r<br />\r<br />My Other Mods:\r<br />Marrik, The Ghost Thief: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79733/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79733/?\r<br />[/url]Lilitha, The Ghost Mage: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79734/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79734/?\r<br />[/url]Phydra, The Dawnguard Ghost: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79794/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79794/?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Credits: Me, for making the mod.\r<br />Bethesda, for making Skyrim, and providing the Creation Kit\r<br />Darkfox127, for his Creature Companion Tutorial",
