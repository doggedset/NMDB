  "descriptionHtml": "You are a brave son/daughter of Skyrim, your family lived in it for many years. You chose to join the stormcloaks, for Skyrim should be ruled by the Nords. You are a brave warrior/archer/mage/assassin/spellsword/cleric/necromancer. Or came to Skyrim because your family lived there before in the days of old.\r<br />\r<br />But you have no place to call home. Until today&#33; Well, I&#39;m sure someone did this already, but you know what I mean.\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]AV-GsCfN9rk[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Thanks for Youdojo for making a video about it&#33; \r<br />\r<br />There many fancy houses in the nexus made by amazing modder. But I like things down to earth (until I get some money.) or a house that suit a simple play through. Also there not many houses on the nexus that have adoption support while being humble and poor looking. So I made my own.   \r<br />\r<br />In front of the docks stands the place you call home, a small Windhelm style house. It not the fanciest thing, small with one floor, cracked wooden panels, walls with holes in them. But should be good until you have money to buy the majestic Hjerim. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />It has:\r<br />A master bedroom with enchant and alchemy. Each with a container. Also a dresser, closet and a chest.\r<br />A full set of storm cloak armor to act as a container for armor.\r<br />&gt;A shrine for Talos.\r<br />A barrel to throw trash in.\r<br />Two beds for followers.\r<br />Full crafting outside.\r<br />A map marker.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]The hearthfire version replaces the follower beds with children beds. \r<br />You will need http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29249/? to move the kids&#33;\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />Credits:\r<br />JokerinesResources for the plates and food.",
