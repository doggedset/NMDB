  "summary": "my first mod.\r\nnot lore friendly.\r\npet dragon.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Keim can be found just outside the main gate of riverwood (south west side) on the hill just on the south side of the road. he is about the size of a sabrecat.\r\n\r\nthere are a few bugs that i haven\\'t been able to fix.\r\n\r\nthe initial dialogue is bugged. \r\n\r\nhe only walks (as far as i have tested)\r\n-he only has one pace (slow) I don\\'t know how to fix this because movement speed affects flight not walking for dragons.\r\n\r\nhe disagrees with some Navmesh but after he loads properly it fixes. (most of the time)\r\n\r\nif you can fix these bugs i would appreciate it and/or of if you could tell me how to myself i could learn to keep these issues out of future updates.\r\n\r\ni cant figure out to upload images for the mod either.",
