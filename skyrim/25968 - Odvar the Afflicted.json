  "descriptionHtml": "[center]Odvar the Afflicted is a custom voiced, quest aware companion. What does that mean? That means he knows what stage of the main quest you\\'re on and may have a few things to say about it.\r\nHe\\'s also partially aware of progress in other quest lines.[/center]\r\n\r\nI\\'m no longer working on Odvar :( \r\nI had some plans and had lines written for him joining the companions with you, but I\\'ve 100% lost interest in modding. Sorry guys!\r\n\r\nHopefully people take this as a bit of inspiration though. I made Odvar not long after I started learning how to mod. Don\\'t feel like you could never make something just because you don\\'t know how.\r\n\r\nIf you have ideas for mods, open up that creation kit, read/watch some tutorials and start learning!\r\n\r\n[center][size=+2]Here\\'s a few samples![/size][/center]\r\n[center][youtube]cvC4qHtvsKM[/youtube][youtube]VKGSzd-muLk[/youtube][/center]\r\nOdvar seen at 2:22\r\n[center][youtube]NMiU1s2oLwE[/youtube][youtube]iBLp8-aKhBw[/youtube][/center]\r\n[center][size=+2]Voice acting is done by [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/4470149]Elijah Lucian[/url][/size]. \r\nwww.elijahlucian.ca\r\nelijahlucian@gmail.com\r\nI think he did a flipping great job! Be sure to give him some love if you agree![/center]\r\n[center]You\\'ll need to do a save/reload the first time you play with him to get his dialogue working properly due to patch 1.7[/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Size=+2][color=lightgreen]Skills and abilities[/color][/size]\r\n\r\n(I want to stress that the \\\"vile vomit\\\" ability is a vanilla ability that all the afflicted in game have. I\\'d love to take credit for it but I can\\'t D:)\r\n\r\n[color=green]Vile Vomit[/color] One of the few perks of his affliction is that Odvar can spew acidic vomit on your enemies.\r\n\r\n[color=green]Poisonous Strikes[/color] Odvar\\'s melee attacks deal scaling poison damage in a small area. This does not affect/anger allies.\r\n\r\n[color=cyan]Odvar\\'s Armor[/color] He is a capable alteration mage, and can boost your armor rating for short periods of time. This ability grows as he levels.\r\n\r\n[color=orange]Shared XP[/color] Don\\'t worry about him killing things before you get the chance. He\\'ll share the XP from his favored skills with you!\r\n\r\n[color=purple]Summonable[/color] You also don\\'t have to worry about him getting lost. Odvar carries a tome that will teach you to summon him to your side at almost any time.\r\n\r\nMain Skills - One Handed, Alteration, Marksman\r\nSecondary Skills - Light Armor, Sneak, Block\r\n\r\nPerks - Armsman(2), Agile Defender(2), Light Footed, Dual Flurry\r\n\r\n[center][url=http://www.skyrimgems.com][img]http://SkyrimGEMS.com/images/badge_featured.png[/img][/url][/center]\r\n\r\n[size=+1]Story[/size]\r\n\r\nWhy not hop in game and ask him?\r\n\r\n[size=+1]Location[/size]\r\n\r\nThe Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun\r\n\r\n[size=+2]Load Order[/size]\r\n\r\n- Below UFO\r\n- Above Cerwiden (if you experience issues, that is)\r\n- Or the very bottom, if you have issues getting him to work properly.\r\n\r\n[size=+1]Compatibility[/size]\r\n\r\nWhen using EFF, you\\'ll have to mind control him. \r\n\r\nSeems to clash with Hoth, sadly :(\r\n\r\nIronically... this probably doesn\\'t work with my other mod, Coffee\\'s Companions. Odvar is still present in that file XD\r\n\r\nIf you experience any issues, please let me know. I tested the ever loving crap out of this, but you can never be 100% sure it\\'s going to work for people. \r\n\r\nI\\'ll do my best to help, but getting Odvar to work the way he does now pretty much used all my modding knowledge :P\r\nIf I can\\'t help, just know I\\'ll probably be more frustrated by it than you T.T\r\n\r\n[size=+1]Thanks to[/size] :\r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/460472]JanusForbeare[/url] -  For helping me with my lack of scripting knowledge.

This should help him to stop spamming the armor spell.\r\n\r\nAdded SEQ file for those still having trouble with his dialogue\r\n\r\nAdded optional no vomit ESP",
