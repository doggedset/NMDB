  "descriptionHtml": "HERE\\'s THE IDEA! - Give 1000+ people, all around the world, a chance to audition for the opportunity to choose a character in Skyrim and replace the voice for them.  At this time several actors are doing well over 10 voices each and although they are great, I believe it would add a tremendous amount of immersion if no one had the same actors voice.\r\n\r\nSomeone, somewhere has got to want to sponsor this! Contact me! All we need is the recording time and a few good modders to bring it all together. \r\n\r\nMaybe an Official Nexus Community Update?\r\n\r\nCould you imagine...?",
