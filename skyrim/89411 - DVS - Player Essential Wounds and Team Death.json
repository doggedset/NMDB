  "descriptionHtml": "[center][color=#f1c232][color=#f4f4f4][size=6][b]DVS - Player Essential, Wounds and Team Death[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[/color][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3] English is not my first language and its the first time i write something in English. because of this description will be full of error.\n<br />\n<br /> The objective of this mod is to make the Skyrim death system less annoying, more immersive, less centered in the death of the player and more directed to the defeat of all your team of warriors. After we install mods that add multiple follower the game battles start to be very fun but at same time makes the player be the primary reason to the game over, a follower can fall multiple times (this mod change this) but if the player fall its the end. Sometimes we lose a battle that the Team will sure win, because of a arrow hit in our character. another problem is if you have mods that increase the difficulty, if every hit is a kill its almost impossible to increase the armor and block skills without lowering the difficulty. [/size]\n<br /> \n<br />[i][b][size=4]Attention:[/size][/b][/i] [size=3] This is a v1.02 much things will change in the future versions.

But i think it will work with any other follower mod.\n<br />\n<br /> This mod don't change any record, script, global or anything in vanilla skyrim and don't use assets of any other mod. Is compatible with almost any mod that you have. only have some little incompatibility's with camera mods.\n<br />\n<br /> This mod is incompatible with mods that change the player Death system,  like\n<br />\n<br />    ﻿[size=4][b]Death Alternative[/b][/size] - https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45894/\n<br />   ﻿[size=4][b]Sm Player Essential[/b][/size] - https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16311/\n<br />\n<br /> if you have the mod Enhanced Camera go to \n<br />\n<br /> (Skyrim Install Directory) &#92;Data&#92;SKSE&#92;Plugins&#92; and edit the file SKSE_EnhancedCamera.ini \n<br />\n<br />and change this line:\n<br />[/size][size=3] Use ctrl + F to find it faster.\n<br />\n<br />    bFirstPersonScripted=1\n<br />\n<br />to this:\n<br />\n<br />    bFirstPersonScripted=0\n<br />\n<br />\n<br /> If you don't change this line the camera switch to follower in combat will not work.  [/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[i][b][size=4] Know Bugs and fixes:[/size][/b][/i]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3] I have played the entire Dawnguard dlc and another quests and not have noticed crash or any severe bug, all the bugs below are simple and don't to crash or cause anything more dangerous like corrupt save.\n<br />\n<br /> For some bug fix this mod use a console command:\n<br />\n<br /> Bat FF\n<br />\n<br /> it load txt file that come with the mod to fix some bugs.\n<br />\n<br />==============\n<br /> The player is stuck when he rise:\n<br />\n<br /> this happen when the player is knockout and fall of some edge or its trowed away. to fix this open the console command and type: \n<br />\n<br />  Bat FF \n<br /> \n<br />  The Player will fall and rise and you have control over him again\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />===========================\n<br /> The player cannot open crafting menus or activate things like siting or bookshelf:\n<br />\n<br /> i don't know the reason to this, but its very rare. To fix this open the console command and type: \n<br />\n<br />  Bat FF \n<br />\n<br />  The Player will fall an rise and you will gain control and activate objects again.\n<br />\n<br />====================\n<br /> Bat FF not working\n<br />\n<br /> This mod as a file called  FF.txt   inside your skyrim data folder, if the file its not there you can create a new one.\n<br />\n<br /> create a new text file with notepad and copy and paste:\n<br />\n<br /> set TD_Force_Fall to 1.0\n<br />\n<br /> save the text file in your skyrim data directory naming it to\n<br />\n<br /> FF\n<br />\n<br /> Or anything you like.( the final name will be FF.txt ) When you are playing skyrim and some of the bug above happen, open the console and write:\n<br />\n<br /> Bat FF\n<br />\n<br />or\n<br />\n<br /> bat  \"file name\"\n<br />\n<br />replace the \"file name\" with the name of the text file you have created and saved in your skyrim data folder.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />====================\n<br /> The Camera Don't Change To Follower.\n<br />\n<br /> this can happen for various  reasons, one is the Camera Mods like enhanced camera, to fix this go to incompatibility section above, another is that some magick effects stop this function to work correct like poison, fire, and some enchantments.. Effects that stay damaging the player for a long time blocks the camera switch. after the effect disappear the camera will go to the follower.\n<br />\n<br />==========\n<br />[s]  When the player fall is unequipped spells and shout\n<br />\n<br /> reequip it again they will work[/s]\n<br />\n<br /> fixed in version v1.01\n<br />=========\n<br /> When the player fall when blocking, running he stay in that stance\n<br />\n<br /> click button and of the action he are doing before fall to cancel that action.\n<br /> \n<br />=======\n<br /> Sometimes the Team Death System not call game over when all followers are on ground\n<br />\n<br /> I trying to find a fix to this, but its nothing that will crash or break your gameplay.\n<br />\n<br />=======================\n<br />The player is not falling \n<br />\n<br /> Increase the speed of the script in the config menu\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Mods i use: [/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#1e84cc]Amazing Follower Teaks - https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15524[/color]\n<br />     ﻿Increase the number of follower you can have with lot of options\n<br />    ﻿\n<br />[color=#1e84cc]Deadly Combat - https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/5485\n<br />[size=3][size=3]\n<br /> [color=#ffffff]   ﻿Makes the combat more aggressive and fast, favoring the sword and shield[/color]\n<br />    ﻿[/size][/size]\n<br />Combat Evolved - https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56147\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿ [color=#efefef]Makes the combat mods Extremely hard[/color]\n<br />\n<br />Deadly dragons - https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3829[/color]\n<br />[size=3][color=#1e84cc] \n<br />  [color=#d8d8d8]   ﻿Makes the Dragons Extremely hard[/color][/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][size=3][color=#1e84cc]Attack Commitment No turning during attacks[size=3]﻿ - https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70079[/size] [/color][/size][/size]\n<br /> \n<br />   ﻿You can dodge attacks without mods, simple moving away from the front of your enemy\n<br />\n<br />[color=#1e84cc][size=3][size=3]Genesis - Dynamically Increased Enemy Spawns[/size][/size] - https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67811[/color]\n<br />\n<br />      Increase the Enemy's Spaws in the interiors \n<br />\n<br />[color=#1e84cc]Archery Gameplay Overhaul - https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69033[/color]\n<br />\n<br />    ﻿Makes the Archery combat Fun and Hard\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=3][color=#1e84cc]NPC Knockout Overhaul[/color][color=#1e84cc] - https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52681[/color]\n<br />  \n<br />   ﻿   The essential npcs will stay on floor\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][size=3][color=#1e84cc]High Level Enemy's  -[/color][/size][/size] [color=#1e84cc]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27866[/color]\n<br />\n<br />  Adds enemies with level scaling\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#1e84cc]Skyrim Immersive Creatures[/color] -[/b][color=#efefef]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24913[/color]\n<br />\n<br /> Adds more challenging creatures to the skyrim world\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b][color=#1e84cc]Warzones - https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9494\n<br />\n<br />[/color][/b][/size][size=3]Adds  big factions battles in the world, if you have a good pc and want to see hundred of soldiers fighting and trying to kill you, [/size]this is for you.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/size]",
