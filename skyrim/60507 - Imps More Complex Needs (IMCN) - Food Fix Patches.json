  "summary": "Two patches that fixes some food issues in IMCN v0.31. One plain fix and one that combines the three IMCN DLC patches into one Legendary patch along with the food fixes.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[b][size=4][u]Food Fix for Imp&#39;s More Complex Needs[/u][/size][/b]\r<br />[size=2][i]by Calanor[/i][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This should fix the various food issues in [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10639/?]&#34;Imp&#39;s More Complex Needs&#34;[/url] v0.31, such as Mudcrab Legs and Potato Soup not functioning properly. The entries use full nutritional data, rather than generic tags. The patch comes in two flavours:\r<br />\r<br />[list][*][size=2][i]IMCN - Legendary with food fixes[/i] - apart from fixing the food issues, it also combines all three DLC patches for IMCN. This is intended for those who are using a massive number of mods and are running out of slots.[/size][/*]\r<br />[*][size=2][i]IMCN - v0.31 Food Fix[/i] - fixes the same issues, but without combining the DLC patches. Note that you will still need all three DLCs installed.[/size]\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />If I&#39;ve somehow managed to make a mess of things, feel free to drop me a line about it as long as you keep your temper in check ;)\r<br />\r<br />[u][i]Note&#33;[/i][/u] If you want to use this patch with a previously saved game, it&#39;s vital that you rebuild IMCN&#39;s lists. If you do not, you might get all manners of weird effects, ranging from screwed up nutritional data, to food items turning into other items when you cancel a meal and even bogging down your game something severe after you&#39;ve tried to eat. All you need to do is to enter the IMCN actions menu: click on the IMCN Vitality potion in your inventory, choose Actions and then Rebuild Lists. Wait a few seconds until a windows pops forth telling you that the lists have been rebuilt and you should be ready to go. If you want to be absolutely sure that your save game won&#39;t be messed up, make sure to create a backup of it first.\r<br />\r<br />Update: v1.01 - Redwater Skooma should actually work as intended now. I also increased the number of portions you get when cooking potato soup.",
