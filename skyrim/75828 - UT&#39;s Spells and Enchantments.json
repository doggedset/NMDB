  "summary": "Adds a few new spells and enchantments.",
  "descriptionHtml": "[size=3][size=2]This mod is meant to be used with my other mod UT&#39;s Adjustments (link below), but can be used on its own just fine. All of these are also meant to be very balanced when compared to vanilla enchantments and spells.\r<br />\r<br />Note that some of these enchantments are fairly rare to find. If you know much about console commands you can get everything right away.\r<br />I wanted to add an unlocking spell to Alteration, but it is very difficult to do.[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=4]New enchantments:\r<br />[/size][list]\r<br />[*][size=3]Protection - adds armor rating, I basically did the same thing as the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57717/?]Armor Rating Enchantment[/url] mod but changed some things (much less powerful for one thing), works on all gear except rings and amulets, I consider the power of it pretty balanced but if you are not using another mod (like my other one) which buffs enchantments on clothing, you might think it is weak for that purpose.[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Night vision on helmets/circlets (if you activate a night vision ability after equiping the enchant, it turns off, not sure if I can prevent this)[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Haste (movement speed) on boots and rings[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Luck - adds critical chance, works on gloves, body and necklaces, like with the Protection enchantment you might want another mod which buffs critical damage[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Blessing of Talos (shout recharge) on helmets/circlets and necklaces, set to 20%[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Shocking Fist on gloves/gauntlets (I also slightly buffed Fortify Unarmed Damage so it&#39;s balanced)[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Explosion on weapons[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Poison Damage on weapons[/size]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[size=4]New spells:[/size]\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][size=3]Strengthen - Alteration, expert, adds 40 carry weight for 3 mins, there&#39;s another file without this spell[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Poison Bolt - [size=3]Restoration[/size], adept, 5 points of poison damage every second for 10 seconds, similar to the poison enchantment in that it can only be applied once per target[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Dispel - [size=3]Restoration, expert,[/size] removes all temporary effects from the target, not very useful honestly, but I figure the more tools the better[/size]\r<br />[*][size=3]Cure Disease - Restoration, expert[/size]\r<br />[/list][size=3]\r<br />\r<br />These are all found or bought, not given automatically or anything like that.\r<br />I might add more later (feel free to post ideas). To install just paste this file in Skyrim&#39;s Data folder.\r<br />If you are also using a mod which adds a new school of magic, it will likely have to come after this one in the load order.\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=4]\r<br />Other mods:\r<br />[size=3]I would highly recommend also using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50044/?]Waterwalking Spell Tomes and Scrolls\r<br />[/url]Also my other mod, [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75792/?]UT&#39;s Adjustments[/url][/size][/size]",
