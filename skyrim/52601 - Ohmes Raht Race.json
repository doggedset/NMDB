  "descriptionHtml": "First, I can NOT take full credit for this mod. This mod was created by eqlipse. I simply added little more texture, expressions with ears, mouth, eyes, and eye brows. Also made it compatible with most body mods. You can find eqlipse here: \r<br />\r<br /> http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/topic/6586-so-i-decided-to-create-a-better-ohmes-raht-race/\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This mod is made for the Females. The males just look like Bretons. Meaning I haven&#39;t created one for the males yet.The scale height of the female are the same as Bretons. This does not replace the Khajiit Races in Skyrim itself. This is a new race that&#39;s added to the racemenu. For body mods, I mainly used UNP-B, 7BASE, and CBBE vanilla. I know for sure these body shapes work. I haven&#39;t tried all the other possible Body types. Also added Three war paints from the Khajiit over to this race as well.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Please do upload your created characters&#33;&#33;&#33; Would love to see them.\r<br />\r<br />To Install:\r<br />I highly recommend you use SKSE.\r<br />or\r<br />Simply unzip the folder, go to your Skyrim directory, copy textures, meshes, the esp and esm into your Skyrim data folder.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements: \r<br />\r<br />RaceCombatibility \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Some Mods Seen in Screenshots:\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Apachii Hair (Hair)\r<br />Circlet 2k - or - 4k (Circlet)\r<br />Edhildils UNPB Witch Doctor BBP (Armor)\r<br />real girls - medium- (For Human Skin Tone)\r<br />DragonSteel Weapons (Weapon set)\r<br />Sexy Tsuns Armor Mashup 7B Cleavage \r<br />7Base Armor - Orcish and Hide",
