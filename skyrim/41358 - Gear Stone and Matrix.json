  "descriptionHtml": "Tired of using console commands everytime you want something simple like a daedric armor or a dwarven greatsword? Want to test some Enchantment but lacking armor to enchant?\r\n\r\nThis mod is the solution.\r\nIt provides the Gear Stone and the Gear Matrix, which both deliver the basic items of the Vanilla game.\r\n\r\nThey are both located at the Bandit Camp near the Guardian Stones.\r\n\r\nWhile the Gear Stone is only available in this location the Gear Matrix can be carried in your inventory and just needs to be activated (clicked on in the inventory) to provide the same menu and functions.\r\n\r\nThey Provide:\r\nWeapons:\r\nAll Weapon Types + Arrows for:\r\nIron, Steel, Dwarven, Orcish, Ebony and Daedric Weapons\r\n\r\nAll Armor Parts and Shields for:\r\nHide, Fur, Iron, Leather, Steel, Dwarven, Elven, Orcish, Scaled, Steel Plate, Ebony, Glass, Dragonplate and Dragonscale Armors\r\n\r\nThis mod is my first attempt at scripting so don\\'t jugde it to harsh.\r\n\r\n*sorry for my bad english, it\\'s not my native language*\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\n- Bethesda for Skyrim and their Tutorials for the Creation Kit",
