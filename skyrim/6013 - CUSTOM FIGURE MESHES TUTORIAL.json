  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first share posting here at Nexus. I have been asking around lately on how to modify figure meshes, but have had some real shit luck with it. That is why I decided to bite the bullet & sell my soul to Chuck Norris. After seven hours of rigorous prostrating, my new master finally granted me knowledge needed to accomplish my goals. What a bargain, hey?\r\n\r\nWhile my tutorial utilizes steps involved in our buddy Vannus\\' guide to getting meshes into Skyrim, it ALSO mentions one important aspect which I believe only Master Norris knew until now. To get the weight slider working: After doing the known steps, you must \\\"Remove Duplicate Vertices\\\" and reconstitute your skin partition!! AHHHH! It\\'s so simple. Boy, I wish I had my filthy soul back. Oh well. I have some cool Skyrim bods at least! \r\n\r\nGood luck and happy mesh modding, everyone! \r\n\r\nSo provideth the Pizza Monster...\r\n\r\nPS: Heres a link to the PDF in case something happens to the servers here at Nexus:\r\nhttp://troy2.magix.net/SkyrimMeshModdersguide101.pdf",
