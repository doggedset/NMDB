  "modName": "Cart and Carriage Havok and Physics FIX",
  "summary": "Fixes most of the &#34;cart going crazy&#34; physics issues at the start of game, or at other times when riding a cart/carriage. Previously named &#34;Cart Carriage Havok Patch for SOS and other Mods&#34;.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This will most likely fix any mod that causes the carts and carriages physics/havok to go nuts.\r<br />  \r<br />It turns out it was actually pretty simple, just a single value change in NifScope on the carriage model used.\r<br />\r<br />Love the mods guys.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />THE BAD:\r<br />* (with touring carriages mod) A creature might run inside the back of the carriage for a moment occasionally. Merely aesthetic.\r<br />\r<br />THE GOOD:\r<br />* Compatibility with possibly many mods (anything that causes carts to flip or act weird). \r<br />* (with touring carriages mod) Decreases chances of bugging out and never reaching destination (tree or rock in the way? This will fix many).\r<br />* Fix has no dependencies.\r<br />* Replaces no files, and has no scripts, nothing added to your save game, so can be installed/uninstalled without any issues at any time.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION:\r<br />Just install through your mod manager.\r<br />\r<br />UNINSTALLATION:\r<br />Just disable the fix in NMM (or delete the model file Data/meshes/furniture/prisonercarriage/scenictourcarriage02.nif).",
