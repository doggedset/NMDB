  "descriptionHtml": "____________Race Specific Body Meshes Textures and Skeletons____________\r\nby SPAWNOFTHEFLAMES\r\n\r\nThis changes the file area for character assets to have separate parts for each race that you can edit independently of the others. For example you could have different textures for each race, with varying amounts of body hair. You could have some races having body builder meshes and others not, you could have different nude meshes for each race, you can even have separate skeletons meaning you can have unique argonians or khajits for example. \r\nFor unique body hair textures I recommend using: Better males - Beautiful nudes and faces - New hairstyles by Chris57 and FavoredSoul\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2488\r\nYou will need to put new meshes into the characterassets/[raceofyourchoice] and new textures into the usual place in textures. The race folder: “male”. Acts as the default skin. Textures that go in here will be the textures that appear when wearing armor like hide, which shows bare skin, so I would recommend having this match with your own character’s race.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think! I\\'d love to hear from you and if you could leave this window open so you remember to endorse, that would make me extremely happy.\r\n\r\nEnjoy :D\r\n\r\nSpawn of the Flames\r\n\r\nVersions:\r\nVersion 1 – Vanilla (16/02/12): Only affects males. Includes new folder directories and the vanilla files to go in them. \r\n\r\nFuture Updates:\r\nFind a way to make armour utilize race textures rather than default “male” textures.\r\nExpand this to women too if people want to use different meshes/skins for different races. Let me know if you would be interested in this.\r\nI hope to get the permission from Chris57 to include his textures in a download so you dont have to add them yourself.\r\nModify nudes to vary nude character assets between races. These body mods are near the end of production and are an edit of nude meshes by Sundracon.\r\n\r\nBugs:\r\nArmors use default \\\"male\\\" race textures\r\n\r\nUninstillation:\r\nThis mod only adds folders, and doesn\\'t edit any of your previous files so just uncrossing it in data files should restore everything to normal. Recrossing it again should restore it.\r\n",
