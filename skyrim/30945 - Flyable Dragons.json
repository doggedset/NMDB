  "descriptionHtml": "[color=#ffd700][b]Flyable Dragons v 0.1 by J3X[/b][/color]\r<br />[i][color=#ff0000]No DLC nor SKSE required. Beta release, contains probably bugs.[/color][/i]\r<br />\r<br />Don&#39;t like this implementation but still want steerable flying dragons? Try hfiani&#39;s Dragon Fly Mod - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30464\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds two flyable dragon mounts; Dremlokmir, an Elder Dragon, and a Skeletal Dragon. The dragons do not help the player in combat and are supposed to be used as transport only.\r<br />\r<br />This mod where created, and rushed to release, mostly to prove that flyable dragons where possible without Dragonborn. I had an alpha version of this mod as early as July in 2012, it had however some severe animation issues.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffd700][b]How to find:[/b][/color]\r<br />Skyrim legend tells of a hero known as the Draugrborn, a warrior with the body of a corpse and soul of a dragon, whose destiny it is to destroy the evil mortal Dragonborn. He is currently on his way to High Hrothgar in search for inner peace and a non violent way of stopping Dragonborn from eradicating all Draugr in Skyrim...\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#ffd700]How to use:[/color][/b]\r<br />- This mod contains a lot of bugs. Save before taking a ride\r<br />- Summon your dragon either via a shout or via a spell (get them via Draugrborn).\r<br />- A dragon will appear above you and pick you up. Stand still and wait.\r<br />- The script will try to auto mount you, it might work or it might fail. If that is the case, mount manually.\r<br />- Look up and look down to steer up and down. For some weird reason are the controls a bit slow.\r<br />\r<br />- You can summon your dragons again when you have received the message &#34;Your dragon has returned&#34;.\r<br />- The dragon will not disappear unless you mount it, ride it and dismount it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffd700][b]Videos:[/b][/color]\r<br />[youtube]-Sk9ZwWEWec[/youtube]\r<br />[youtube]4b6cb22ZMow[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffd700][b]Known Bugs & solutions:[/b][/color]\r<br />- The mount part is quite buggy and it takes a while for the game to detect that you have mounted and dismounted your dragon.\r<br />- Altitude drops (same as in my broomstick mod) have returned for some weird reason. If you experience them look up into the sky and hope for the best.\r<br />- The camera behaves a bit weird while you fly around.\r<br />- The dragons legs behave also a bit weird.\r<br />- The solution to most of these problems (at least for me) was to create a new game. I think this is because my saved game had to many scripts running. Give it a try if you experience any bugs.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffd700][b]Release log:[/b][/color]\r<br />0.1 - Release\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffd700][b]Credits & Permission:[/b][/color]\r<br />Scripts and animations by J3X. \r<br />Clone, copy, spread, mutate, merge, and do whatever you want just as long you give me credit for my work. \r<br />If you upload this mod to any other site (don&#39;t upload to sites that make money from mods) please make sure that it&#39;s updated and link back to this site. \r<br />You do not need to ask for permission to use this mod. \r<br />If you create a modification to this mod please release it. \r<br />If you manage to fix some bug or add a new awesome feature please let it be included in this mod as well.\r<br />\r<br />Dragon Skeleton & models by fLokii.\r<br />Contact for permission to use.\r<br />\r<br />[b]I am no longer modding Skyrim but still provides tech support over email or PM.[/b]\r<br />[img]http://www.catalope.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/test2_.png[/img]\r<br />I run a small game studio called Catalope Games, if you enjoy my mods please check it out.\r<br />[b][url=http://www.catalope.co/]Official Webpage[/url] | [url=https://www.facebook.com/CatalopeGames/]Facebook[/url] | [url=https://twitter.com/CatalopeGames]Twitter[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Catalope]Join our Steam Group&#33;[/url][/b]",
