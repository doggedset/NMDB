In this way, people will use them, having no mod dependency.\r<br />\r<br />Oblivion hair versions require Oblivion Hair Pack Fixed now with NPCEditor Support by DragonAge7. I remember you that, if you will try to run the oblivion hair versions whithout Oblivion hair pack, your game will CTD.\r<br />\r<br />They both are not only followers, having the capability to buy items also following the Dovakin, wherever he goes, up to 12000 gold pieces for each one. It is possible to sell them all items not interesting, having money and not ever being over encumbered. The first sells minerals, the second ingredients, including Daedra Hearts. \r<br /> \r<br />They both have their own Class, as well their own combat style, 2 special ebony swords and some arrows in their inventory. All these items will be useful to her and player, if liked. \r<br />\r<br />In my system are installed these mods:\r<br />\r<br />Aesthetic:\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Calientes Beautiful Bodies Edition -CBBE- by Caliente\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666/?\r<br />\r<br />Bella&#39;s Better Females version 3:\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r<br />\r<br />No More Blocky Faces by Xenius\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=30\r<br />\r<br />Natural Eyes by nevenbridge\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3589/?\r<br />\r<br />Seductive Lips HD by EcthelionOtW\r<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22701/?\r<br />They should also work with a vanilla install of Skyrim, but the look will be different from the look of the screenshots.\r<br />\r<br />Functional:\r<br />\r<br />Amazing Follower Tweaks\r<br />http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15524\r<br />\r<br />It is important that it can be higher than my file in the load order. I keep it just under the last .esm.\r<br />\r<br />If you don&#39;t have it, these NPC will accept to follow you only one at time.\r<br />\r<br />  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Install\r<br />=======\r<br />\r<br />I like very much Nexus Mod Manager, it is perfect for me. I suggest to use it, but....your choice.\r<br />\r<br />Pick which method you are going to use for installation:\r<br />\r<br />Nexus Mod Manager Installation\r<br />- = or = -\r<br />Manual installation \r<br />\r<br />Nexus Mod Manager installation:\r<br />Download the file with Nexus Mod Manager. Activate it. Done.\r<br />\r<br />Manual Installation:\r<br />Place the zip file&#39;s contents into your Skyrim/data folder to install and be sure to activate the ESP and ESM files in your Data Files listing.\r<br />\r<br />NMM downloading problem.\r<br />I have seen that in early hours after uploading a file, NMM can not give the possibility to download new files using the button &#34;download with manager&#34;. An error message says that file do not exist. After one or two hours, the problem is automatically solved. I don&#39;t know why this happens, maybe it is related to high traffic that Nexus server is forced to tolerate. \r<br />\r<br />In this case, you can follow these instructions:  \r<br />1) Download the file manually.\r<br />2) Open NMM.\r<br />3) Hit the black arrow located in the left high button and choose &#34; Add Mod from file&#34;.\r<br />4) Locate and select the file that you have downloaded manually. \r<br />5) Hit &#34;open&#34; button.\r<br />6) From Mod&#39;s  list, select the created file and activate it. Done.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Uninstall\r<br />=========\r<br />Pick which method you are going to use for uninstall based on how you installed it:\r<br />\r<br />Nexus Mod Manager Uninstall\r<br />- = or = -\r<br />Manual Uninstall\r<br />\r<br />Nexus Mod Manager Uninstall\r<br />Open Nexus mod Manager and deactivate the file EASeleneMerFolNE. Done.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Manual Uninstall\r<br />\r<br />Remove the zip file&#39;s contents from your Skyrim/data folder to uninstall and be sure to deactivate the ESP and ESM files in your Data Files listing.\r<br />----------------\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Upgrade\r<br />=======\r<br />Upgrading from a previous version can make you loose all the equipment that you have give to them, so it is better to \r<br />take all their things and dismiss them first, then uninstall the previous version and then install the newer.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Incompatibility\r<br />===============\r<br />None known.\r<br />\r<br />Known Issues or Bugs\r<br />====================\r<br />If you decide to marry one of them, it is better to tell her where she can live with you BEFORE she leaves the temple in Riften.\r<br />\r<br />History\r<br />=======\r<br />01/Feb/2013 Version 1.0 is the initial version of this file.\r<br />31/Dic/2013 Version 1.1: corrected a bug in the merchant money.\r<br />01/Jan/2014 Version 1.2: corrected an ulterior bug in the Selenia&#39;s money.\r<br />03/Jan/2014 Oblivion hair Version 1.2: added 2 different  hairstyles from Oblivion hair.\r<br />04/Jan/2014 Oblivion hair Version 1.2(2): added a single hairstyle to both from Oblivion hair.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Contact\r<br />=======\r<br />You can find me on TESNexus as eamico\r<br />You can send me an email here: eamico@tiscali.it\r<br />\r<br />Credits\r<br />=======\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r<br />Thanks to TESNexus.com for the a one-stop-shop resource for authors and players.\r<br />Thanks to DragonAge7 for Oblivion Hair Pack Fixed now with NPCEditor Support. \r<br />Special thanks to Blackie for his CM New Companions mod that includes a top-notch detailed tutorial on how to create Skyrim companions without the face discoloration bug.
