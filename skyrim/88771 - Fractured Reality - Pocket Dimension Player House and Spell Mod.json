Once you're in, you'll be met with all the crafting benches you'd need to make whatever the heck you'd like. Not only will you have crafting benches, but quite a few places to display your very nice, very cool, weapons and armor pieces that you have accumulated (or added through console commands, I don't judge, in fact y'know what I encourage) over your playtime.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=6][b]Location[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=3]The spell tome used to learn the spell \"Fractured Dimension\" can be found in the Midden underneath the College of Winterhold, right by that thing that you put the sigil stone in you know what I'm talking about, I have a picture don't worry.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=6][b]Spells[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=3]So you get three spells:\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=4][b][i]Reality Fracture:[/i][/b] [/size][size=3]That's the spell you use to [s]tele to varrock[/s] teleport to the home.\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿[b]Location: [/b]In the midden, near that, uh, thing you get daedric stuff from (I have pictures, cool it) you'll find the tome [b]Alternative Space[/b].\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=4][b][i]Fracture Storage:[/i][/b][/size][i] [/i][size=3]Cast this guy and you'll open up your hyperdimensional storage unit, where you can grab, or put in, however much your heart desires.[/size]\n<br />[size=3]   ﻿   ﻿   ﻿[/size][b][size=3]Location:[/size] [/b][size=3]In the home, on the end table of your bed, you'll find the tome [/size][b][size=3]Excess Space[/size][/b][size=3].\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=4][b][i]Wrath:[/i][/b] [/size][size=3]This is the bad boy destruction spell you're gonna want to have.
