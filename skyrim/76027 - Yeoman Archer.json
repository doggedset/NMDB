  "descriptionHtml": "Leave that fancy elven stuff to the elves, and leave steel to the Sheriff&#39;s men.  \r<br />What you need is good home-tanned leather.\r<br />This simple non-replacing plug-in is intended to support role-playing\r<br />as a yeoman archer or scruffy Sherwood Forest outlaw.  The archer&#39;s\r<br />leather armor and wooden bows are designed to look home-made.\r<br />I&#39;ve made both archer&#39;s leather armor and yew longbow depend on\r<br />the Steel Smithing perk; they should be fully temperable, so that\r<br />there&#39;ll be less need to abandon leather and wood at higher levels.\r<br />No existing objects are replaced.\r<br />All equipment in this plug-in uses and requires the Steel Smithing perk.\r<br />Once you have this perk you&#39;ll find the the archer&#39;s leather cap, bracers, \r<br />leather jacket and boots listed at any forge under leather.  You&#39;ll find \r<br />yew longbows under wood and Nord arrows under &#34;miscellaneous.&#34;  \r<br />With more Smithing experience, Yeoman and Dragonslayer arrows \r<br />and longbows can be crafted working from the Arcane Blacksmith \r<br />and Dragon Armor perks.\r<br />Installation:  drop the YeomanArcher.esp file into the Skyrim Data folder,\r<br />then enable it.  If you use Nexus Mod Manager, find the plug-in tab\r<br />and check the box next to YeomanArcher.  If you are using the basic\r<br />main game launcher, select &#34;Data&#34; and double-click your plugin.\r<br />Uninstall:  save your game and delete the plug-in.\r<br />Other mods:\r<br />No new meshes or textures are added, and no original files are overwritten,\r<br />so I would expect this plug-in to be broadly compatible with other mods.\r<br />For a melee weapon, consider JZBai&#39;s Quarterstaff mod from Skyrim Nexus:\r<br />  http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25431/?\r<br />Sessine&#39;s Better Shaped Longbows .nif is also useful:\r<br />  http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25431/?\r<br />More prosperous outlaws might like Atomec&#39;s Rough Leather Armor mod:\r<br />  http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54672/?\r<br />Please let me know if any part of this plug-in doesn&#39;t work.\r<br />Thank you&#33;",
