  "descriptionHtml": "This is the first mod I have ever made. I found simple music replacements to be easy enough. Requests are welcome but please take my newness to modding into consideration. This mod will replace the music that plays in the main menu for an original piano cover by advaitnemlekar on youtube. He calls it a piano cover but it actually has alot of great instrumentation. I did not write the music I only put together the mod. Watch his video and see his talent for yourself! \r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu9HVwHDCkY\r\n\r\nInstallation: Put into data folder or simply use NMM.\r\n\r\nUninstallation: Delete music from Data folder.",
