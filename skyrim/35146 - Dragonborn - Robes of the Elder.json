  "descriptionHtml": "&#34;Of course you have. Everyone has heard of the master wizards of Morrowind. We are one of the great houses that rule Morrowind.&#34; -- Master Neloth\r<br />\r<br />Important: This mod requires the Dragonborn DLC&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This mod provides two sets of craftable outfits, one with the look of Telvanni robes, and one with the look of Temple Priest robes. These robes are known as the Ald&#39;Telmin, the traditional robes worn by Dunmer elders denoting rank. They are available in both cloth and armored varieties. If you wish to rationalize this, envision them as robes worn over regular armor. The Temple Priest robes are bulky enough to easily justify this.\r<br />\r<br />The Elder Telvanni set is available as light armor. The Telvanni shoes had clipping issues, and were replaced with plain black shoes. I tried a variety of boot styles, but all had clipping issues depending on gender. Handwraps and a circlet are provided to complete the set. The high collar can cause clipping with some hairstyles. These all have hte same armor material types indicated in the parenthesis. They require Elven, Glass, and Dragon smithing perks respectively for crafting.\r<br />\r<br />Elder Telvanni Robes (cloth)\r<br />Elder Telvanni Chitin Armor (light chiten)\r<br />Elder Telvanni Vitreous Armor (glass)\r<br />Elder Telvanni Dragon Armor (dragonscale)\r<br />\r<br />The Elder Temple set is available as heavy armor. Wristguards are provided with the set, but the wide sleeves allows mix and matching gauntlets from other sets. There is some minor clipping around the neck for females wearing the hood. These all have hte same armor material types indicated in the parenthesis. They require Steel, Advanced, and Daedric/Dragon smithing perks respectively for crafting.\r<br />\r<br />Elder Temple Robes (cloth)\r<br />Elder Temple Bonemold Armor (bonemold)\r<br />Elder Temple Dwemer Armor (dwarven)\r<br />Elder Temple Chitin Armor (heavy chitin)\r<br />Elder Temple Chimer Armor (ebony)\r<br />Elder Temple Dragon Armor (dragonplate)\r<br />\r<br />As a bonus (&#33;) I have provided recipes for special heart stone robes. Please note that these only appear as the heart stone variant when worn by females. They must be worn with the Heart Stone amulet for the full effect. These recipes require heart stones.\r<br />\r<br />Heart Stone Robes\r<br />Heart Stone Chitin Robes\r<br />Heart Stone Vitreous Robes\r<br />Heart Stone Dragon Robes\r<br />Heart Stone Amulet\r<br />\r<br />-- \r<br />Changes 1.2 - Added dwarven and ebony versions of temple robes\r<br />Changes 1.1 - Added heart stone versions",
