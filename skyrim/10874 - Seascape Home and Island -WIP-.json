  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod of a player home, and I\\'m still working on it but would like some feedback.\r\nEndorse if you like!!\r\n\r\nPlayer Home is Located underneath the Solitude Arch, Just East of the EETC Docks. The player home is pretty bare at the moment, the outside is looking pretty decent but is still a work in progress. The Garden has an anvil for Smithing and an enchanting table inside just by the back door. Will be updated Regularly. Suggestions welcome.\r\n\r\n[Update]\r\nChanged The Name of the mod due to conflicts with other mods on Steam. Began adding more furniture and clutter to the player home. Now has enchanting table near the exit to the Garden. More to come. \r\n\r\nv1.1\r\nMoved Location of Abode Due to clipping with EETC ships. Now Located West of Solitude Docks and EETC. Just Across the River from Solitude Sawmill.\r\nv1.12\r\nCan now use all the chairs and the Grindstone in the home. Added a safe that should be easy to find, General clutter etc\r\n\r\n[Due to Come]\r\nGoing to be adding a quest for the house and a specific Argonian file with underwater only Entrance.\r\n\r\n[Note]\r\nAlso on Skyrim Nexus/Steam.",
