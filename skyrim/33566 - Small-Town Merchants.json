  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center]This mod adds a bunch of merchants to towns that didn&#39;t have them. Requires no DLC and has no scripts.[/center]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#9fc5e8][center][size=5][i]SSE version available [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6469?]here[/url], thanks to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/7824124/?]MisterB1969 &#33;[/url] &lt;3[/i][/size][/center][/color][i][center][url=http://tesall.ru/files/file/8851-torgovcy-nebolshih-poseleniy/]Русский перевод от vitalyudin [/url][/center][/i]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][center][color=#3c78d8]== WHAT ==[/color][/center][/size]\r<br />A bunch of shops&#33; All open from [b]9 AM to 21 PM[/b] [i](except for the merchants in Goldenrod, who work 24/7) [/i]and have about 750 pieces of gold for trading. They have vanilla dialogue since I am not good with that kind of thing, but have little backstories based on letters and journals you&#39;ll find around their workplaces. Now, a bit of info about the merchants added:\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />- In [b][color=#f6b26b]Rorikstead[/color][/b], on the edge of town, you&#39;ll meet Valund, a blacksmith, and his wife Hreiri, a trader, whose friend recently opened up a [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32558]library[/url]. Hreiri, a former wanderer, is not dealing very well with life in the peaceful town, so she may be a bit bristly when you go talk to her. \r<br />\r<br />If you choose the optional file, you&#39;ll also meet Fibela, an old lady who will sell potions and ingredients. A young loved one of hers has left, and her heart is broken - maybe you&#39;ve heard of him.\r<br />\r<br />- In [b][color=#f6b26b]Ivarstead[/color][/b], young Elberond has opened a general goods store near the waterfall. His original plan was to open an apothecary, but that didn&#39;t go so well so he has expanded his horizons. That however has not stopped him from doing experiments in Alchemy. Hillock, on the other hand, has opened a small smithy on the slopes right above Fellstar Farm. And, outside of town, Yeena has set up a small camp while she looks for a sample of the elusive crimson nirnroot. In the meantime she will sell potions and ingredients. Will she succeed in her quest? (Bonus points if you manage to get the references to a certain game I made with these last two...)\r<br />\r<br />- In [b][color=#f6b26b]Dawnstar[/color][/b], The Mortar and Pestle has been divided into two flats to maximize compatibility. Pelette has opened a small general store on the second floor after her lover disappeared. What happened to him? Where could he be? \r<br />\r<br />- In [b][color=#f6b26b]Morthal[/color][/b], twin sisters Boguk & Kugob have (begrudgingly) partnered to open a blacksmith and a general goods store while they settle who owns the building, located between Falion&#39;s and Alva&#39;s houses. A small walkway will lead you to the door.\r<br />\r<br />- In [b][color=#f6b26b]Shor&#39;s Stone[/color][/b][b],[/b] a widower Khajiit and his daughter have fallen on hard times after their carriage broke. To make ends meet, the daughter will sell potions and ingredients, while the father will sell general goods. He will also rent you a bedroll on a small tent if you need to rest. \r<br />\r<br />- In [b][color=#f6b26b]Karthwasten[/color][/b], several services have been added: an inn, apothecary, common goods trader and blacksmith. Since there wasn&#39;t much room, I organized them the best I could; the inn is in the center of town (the bed can be rented and everything, although for some reason it takes the innkeeper a little while to show you the bed - it&#39;s the one with the green curtains), and both the apothecary and general traders can be found in the cellar. There&#39;s something strange about them, but they are perfectly friendly and will gladly buy whatever you have to offer, and sell you plenty of things in return. The blacksmith has set up his business with his [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32558]brother&#39;s[/url] help next to the miner&#39;s barracks, which I changed around a bit to get some extra room. \r<br />\r<br />- In [b][color=#f6b26b]Kynesgrove[/color][/b], lofty Lina, a general trader, was really excited to meet up with her husband Huskar, a blacksmith, and start a new life together, but things may not have gone as she originally planned. And, at the local inn, Dravynea the Stoneweaver&#39;s sister, Mirana, has come to visit and will gladly sell potions and ingredients to anybody who is interested. \r<br />\r<br />- Finally, in[color=#f6b26b] [b]Dragon Bridge[/b][/color], Bosmer brothers Slate and Fahook, alongside their dog Shadow, have started a small business on a newly built tower behind the Penitus Oculatus Outpost. They&#39;ll sell potions and weaponry, and buy any you may have for sale. Also, young Julienne Lylvieve, a Breton resident, works cleaning the Four Shields Inn. Since she really wants to own an inn for herself someday, she has decided that it would be good practice to start selling general goods whenever possible.[color=#1E90FF][size=5][center]\r<br />== WHY ==[/center][/size][/color] \r<br />I made this mod after arriving to Ivarstead on the brink of being over-encumbered, only to remember there are no proper merchants to sell loot to there. A search on the Workshop and Nexus yielded no results, so Creation Kit to the rescue&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#1E90FF][size=5][center]== HOW ==[/center][/size]\r<br />[size=3] [/size][/color]To install, extract the contents of your downloaded file to your &#34;[font=Courier New]Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data[/font]&#34; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or you can use your Mod Manager of choice to download the mod automatically. To uninstall, simply delete the files from your Data folder, and you&#39;re good to go. Enjoy and have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][center][/center][/size][center][/center][center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
