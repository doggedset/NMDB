  "summary": "A very sneaky Khajiit follower who&#39;s as good a sneak that has ever snuck.  High level unarmed fighter who will silently ambush a target when asked to attack from behind as long as _you_ are not detected.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Do&#39;Shaar was a monk of the whispering fang cult but as M&#39;aiq has said, after Khajiit arrive in Skyrim something strange happens to them.    While wandering the wilds of high rock he went native and started worshiping the old gods.\r<br />\r<br />Recently he became convinced that it&#39;s his duty to follow the Dragonborn.  Do&#39;Shaar was trained since birth to be an assassin.  He&#39;s very good at sneaking, fights silently and is a highly skilled unarmed fighter.  Of course a Khajiit is never truly unarmed as long as one&#39;s claws are sharp. \r<br />\r<br />If you build up your own sneak skills you&#39;ll find he&#39;s extremely efficient at eliminating any lone adversary.   Work your way behind them then order Do&#39;Shaar to attack.  If he can, he&#39;ll quietly dispatch his target without raising any alarms.\r<br />\r<br />Do&#39;Shaar requires nothing more than Skyrim with the official update.  Images show Do&#39;Shaar with these mods (I think)  Muscular Khajiit Textures http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim /mods/40043/  and  Bulky Skeleton for Beast Race http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61132/\r<br />\r<br />You&#39;ll find Do&#39;Sharr in the Markarth Warrens.
