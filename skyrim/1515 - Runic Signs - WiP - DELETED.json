  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Runic Signs[/b] is a small-ish mod that changes all the signage in Skyrim to a script more fitting a Viking/Norse-themed setting: The Elder Futhark - you most likely have seen them before. There are two \\\"flavours\\\" of the signs: Runes and Runeglish. One is the actual futhark runes, the other is rune-looking latin letters.\r\n\r\n[size=\\\"5\\\"][center][color=\\\"#FF00FF\\\"]Update 1.2[/color][/center][/size]\r\n* Markath\\'s Silver-blood Inn has been found! No longer will you have to go into Markath and see the inn\\'s sign in boring old vanilla script. Now you can go to Markath and wonder \\'what the hell does that sign say?\\' But only if you choose Runes! :D\r\n* Changed the Roadsigns for all the road markers.\r\n* Removed the _n.dds files as I did not change these... this shouldn\\'t affect the mod working, but if it does, I can put them back.\r\n* Made the new signs files \\\"hi-res\\\" to 1024.\r\n* The cheeky Skeever is still winking...\r\n\r\n[b]To Do:[/b]\r\n* Fix the MarkaRth sign... I so didn\\'t notice that second r. lol\r\n*True Futhark Signs as a third option, using Thorn as TH instead of t and h runes... and other spelling changes. You will only want to use this if you know how to read runes properly.\r\n\r\n[b]Original version 1.0[/b]\r\n* Riverwood inn\r\n* Solitude inn\r\n* Riften inn\r\n* Random hamlet inns like Old Hrolden\r\n* The rodent on the Winking Skeever sign is actually winking now. ;)",
