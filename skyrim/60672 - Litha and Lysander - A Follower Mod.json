  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;ve gained a much richer Skyrim experience because of this community, so I was hoping to successfully give something back. This is my first mod. Flaws are expected. Requires Dawnguard.\r<br />\r<br />Through my many and varied playthroughs in Skyrim, I always end up going back to recreate my two favorite. So, I thought I&#39;d make fairly simple incarnations of those two as followers. The first is a Bosmer archer named Litha; yes, I realize the Bosmer archer is incredibly overplayed, but she was also my first playthrough of Skyrim all the way back in 2011. The second is an Altmer conjuror and vampire named Lysander. I always played him off as a really nice guy that&#39;s made a lot of horrible decision in his life. \r<br />They&#39;re not overly special; they use vanilla voices and the vanilla follower framework. The armor they&#39;re wearing is just retextures of vanilla armor that I threw together on Paint.NET and Photoshop. I wouldn&#39;t even say they&#39;re good, but I liked them. \r<br />Both of them are mostly stand-alone (or are supposed to be, unless I messed up somewhere). Litha also comes with two weapons, the Jaqspur (Artisanix&#39;s Narquelion) and Nagaia (ghosu&#39;s Oakenheart Dagger from his weapon pack), and her own cloak (retextured from Nikinoodles Cloaks of Skyrim). \r<br />Litha uses a custom CBBE body I created with BodySlide, navetsea&#39;s skin texture for CBBE with custom tattoos, fixed eye normal maps by Mr. Dave, and Natural Eyes.\r<br />Lysander uses the vanilla body, fadingsignals SkySight Skins with custom tattoo, fixed eye normal maps by Mr. Dave, and modified eyes from Natural Eyes.\r<br />\r<br />You can find Litha wandering around inside of the Bee and Barb in Riften and you can find Lysander wandering around the Arcanaeum in the College of Winterhold. \r<br />If you want their hair to look like it does in my screenshots, you&#39;ll need to get [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36510/?]Superior Lore-Friendly Hair[/url] by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/6256260/?]skyrimaguas[/url]. I&#39;d also recommend [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2812/?]Better Female by Bella[/url]. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m missing anything else on this description. I certainly hope not.\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Future Plans[/u][/b]\r<br />Hopefully, although I don&#39;t see it happening anytime soon, I&#39;ll be able to get them custom-voiced and have little quests for them as well. In the meantime, they are as they are. (Excluding any fixes that may need to be done. I&#39;d prefer not to give you guys a broken mod.)\r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Credits:[/u][/b]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3330686/?]Caliente[/url] for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666/?]CBBE[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49015/?]BodySlide[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/383710/?]Nikinoodles [/url]for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12092/?]Cloaks of Skyrim [/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/942284/?]nevenbridge81[/url] for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3589/?]Natural Eyes [/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/496662/?]navetsea[/url] for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6554/?]CBBE skin texture [/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2546964/?]fadingsignal[/url] for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58443/?]SkySight Skins[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3099505/?]Artisanix[/url] for Narquelion bow\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3297180/?]ghosu[/url] for Oakenheart Dagger\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/39159/?]Mr. Dave[/url] for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54416/?]Eye Normal Map Fix[/url]\r<br />Everyone who&#39;s uploaded any follower/standalone follower tutorials\r<br />&lt;Bethesda for creating Skyrim ",
