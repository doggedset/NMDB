Improved vanilla textures, some more than others. Have a look at [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X13kWUOECVg]Snoopey0\\'s Comparison Video[/url] on YouTube. You may still want to use [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8236]HD Textures DLC Fix[/url]. Had debated whether the DLC really makes a difference. Well it does. Armour, weapons, clothes, sky, effects... You would be very hard pressed to find a combination of mods that replace all of those.\r\n[color=Darkorange]-SMIM[/color]; [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8655]Static Mesh Improvement Mod[/url] v1.19. Changes the 3D Mesh (model) of objects like barrels to have a more appealing smooth quality than vanilla. A must have. It has its own textures, some (10) of which may be replaced by texture mods to give new look. The wood posts as seen in the Riverwood screenshot (download) are interesting... a few options:\r\n1. Vanilla Wood post with Vanilla Mesh (3D model)\r\n2. SMIM Wood post with SMIM Mesh\r\n3. HD2K Wood post with SMIM Mesh\r\n4. Realistic Overhaul Wood post with SMIM Mesh... not so different to SMIM Wood post as the texture is not so different, yet the texture quality is better.\r\n[color=Darkorange]-SERIOUS_1024/2048[/color]; [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2146]Serious HD Retexture[/url] v1.2.3. Changes Landscape textures, such as grass and snow. Found that many textures are common with HD-2K and Realistic Overhaul.\r\n[color=Darkorange]-HD2K_Lite/Full[/color]; [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=607]HD - 2K Textures[/url] v1.5. Many HD Textures. Many common. The textures don\\'t resemble the originals, HD2K doesn\\'t try to. The textures change the style, which may be appealing to those that use them. These textures are well done and of great quality.\r\n[color=Darkorange]-SRO_1024/2048[/color]; [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5400]Realistic Overhaul[/url] v1.2. Many HD Textures. Many common. Opposite to HD2K, this one attempts to stay close to original style. Overall, it replaces existing textures with higher quality versions while changing other aspects, like removing stones in unpaved roads (Riverwood). I think I\\'m going to use this one.\r\n[color=Darkorange]-CHRIS2012s_WR_1024/2048[/color]; [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=114]Chris2012s Whiterun HQ Texture Pack[/url] v1.01. Mostly Whiterun and interior textures in other zones.\r\n\r\n[size=4][color=aqua][b]2.-[/b][/color][color=Lightskyblue][b] Benchmarking Texture Mods:[/b][/color][/size]\r\nIts the resolution of the textures and how many objects are displayed with them that can impact your Skyrim performance. There\\'s nothing a texture mod can do to help this, other than lowering the resolution and/or quantity of textures. Provided are three benchmarks. SMIM-BETH_HR, MIX_1024-SMIM-BETH_HR and MIX_2048-SMIM-BETH_HR. The MIX will provide the most modded textures, coming in at around 1,400. The texture mods tested my PC combined and shows the impact texture resolution has on my Skyrim performance.\r\n[color=Lightskyblue][b]Skyrim Settings:[/b][/color]\r\nHigh (primarily default. multithreading enabled, AA 8x, FXAA Off); See the System_Configurator image for more details.\r\n[color=Lightskyblue][b]Test PC:[/b][/color]\r\nO/S: Windows 7 64-bit\r\nCPU: Q6600 @ 3.2GHz OC (Intel Quad 2.4GHz)\r\nGPU: ATI Radeon HD 6870 1GB (Catalyst 12.3)\r\nRAM: 4x1GB Kingston DDR2-1066 (5-5-5-15 @ 2.4v)\r\nM/B: Gigabyte X38-DS4\r\nHDD: 1TB Seagate Baracuda 7200.12 (ST31000528AS). Running Win7, Skyrim and textures from this HDD.\r\nAnd: It\\'s an older PC, nothing special\r\n[color=Lightskyblue][b]Benchmark Method:[/b][/color] Fraps v3.4.7 (MinMaxAvg) in Whiterun. Planned two minute sneak from market/stalls to Dragonsreach and around. Noticed the skeleton in the moat. Used a similar method as [url=http://techreport.com/articles.x/22048/4]this[/url].\r\n* Between benchmarks, mods were uninstalled and new ones installed. The PC was then restarted and rested for at least 2 minutes before launching Skyrim.\r\n[color=Lightskyblue][b]Screenshot Method:[/b][/color] Whiterun and Riverwood pre-saves.\r\n[color=Lightskyblue][b]Benchmark results:[/b][/color]\r\n[b]--- This first test provided for comparison ---[/b]\r\n1-SMIM-BETH_HR: FPS; Min 24, Max 62, Avg 57.075\r\n[color=Wheat]+ Run 2: FPS; Min 2, Max 62, Avg 57.458[/color]\r\n[b]--- These test the performance between 1024 and 2048+4096 textures ---[/b]\r\n2-MIX_1024-SMIM-BETH_HR: FPS; Min 18, Max 62, Avg 55.192\r\n[color=Wheat]+ Run 2: FPS; Min 35, Max 62, Avg 57.892[/color]\r\n(SMIM < SERIOUS_1024 < CHRIS2012s_WR_1024 < SRO_1024 < HD2K_Lite)\r\n3-MIX_2048-SMIM-BETH_HR: FPS; Min 0, Max 62, Avg 45.517\r\n[color=Wheat]+ Run 2: FPS; Min 0, Max 62, Avg 45.392[/color]\r\n(SMIM < SERIOUS_2048 < CHRIS2012s_WR_2048 < SRO_2048 < HD2K_Full)\r\n[color=Lightskyblue][b]Summary of Results:[/b][/color]\r\nLite and 1024 resolution textures for me. If you\\'ve got a newer PC, you might have no stutters and Full and 2048 resolution mods would run fine.\r\nPrevious tests showed good overall performance with AA Off and FXAA On. So thats what I\\'m setting for gaming from now on.\r\n[b]Added DDS files to DATA folder[/b]\r\nSMIM ; 61\r\nSMIM < SERIOUS_2048 ; 174\r\nSMIM < CHRIS2012s_WR_2048 ; 154\r\nSMIM < SRO_2048 ; 1,226\r\nSMIM < HD2K_Full ; 651\r\nSMIM < SERIOUS_1024 < CHRIS2012s_WR_1024 < SRO_1024 < HD2K_Lite ; 1,390 [loading time = 20.5sec]\r\nSMIM < SERIOUS_2048 < CHRIS2012s_WR_2048 < SRO_2048 < HD2K_Full ; 1,395 [loading time = 28.2sec]\r\n(mods were installed in order as above. Any existing file was overwritten. SERIOUS and CHRIS2012s_WR would have left little or no contribution of DDS files. [s]I\\'ve yet to calculate that[/s]. It would be interesting to see if any DDS weren\\'t replaced by SRO and HD2K.)\r\n[color=green][b]Update...[/b][/color]\r\nSRO (DDS) = 1,166\r\nHD2K (DDS) = 600\r\n[color=Wheat]SRO <-> HD2K[/color]\r\nOverwritten/common DDS = 440\r\nSRO Used DDS = 726\r\nHD2K Used DDS = 160\r\nDDS = 1,326\r\n[color=Wheat]SRO + HD2K <-> CHRIS2012s_WR[/color]\r\nOverwritten/common DDS = 87\r\nCHRIS2012s_WR Used DDS = 13\r\nDDS = 1,339\r\n[color=Wheat]SRO + HD2K + CHRIS2012s_WR <-> SERIOUS[/color]\r\nOverwritten/common DDS = 113\r\nSERIOUS Used DDS = 0\r\nDDS = 1,339\r\n... so no, it was not worth using the SERIOUS. The files were completely overwritten anyway.\r\n\r\n[size=4][color=aqua][b]3.-[/b][/color][color=Lightskyblue][b] Creating your own combination of textures:[/b][/color][/size]\r\nYou can extract mods manually or you can install multiple texture mods into [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/content/modmanager]Nexus Mod Manager (NMM)[/url]. If you do NMM, make sure to activate them in correct order. Example: SRO_part1, SRO_part2, SRO_part3 and then [S]SRO_update[/S] (for SRO v1.2 2048 res update, you will need to manually install, or install with NMM and then go to your data folder and move the textures from the \\\"SRO 1_2 Update/2048 res\\\" folder. To see a more detailed list in NMM, click the \\\" i+ \\\" button on the left after selecting SRO_part from the list and then choose the corresponding mod info. If you leave mod archives as original downloaded name this will be a breeze and the first and only find will re-list your texture mod with part number or update. I select \\\"No\\\", when NMM asks if I want to upgrade the mod.\r\nDoing it this way, you should look into what large texture mod you want primary. It all depends on what textures you keep and what texture you overwrite as to what will be achieved. You will want to install things in opposite order of what textures you want used.\r\nHere\\'s an example, I want to make Realistic Overhaul the primary:\r\n1. Beth HR DLC, activated\r\n2. SMIM, installed and activated (is a Mesh mod. It changes 3D models and has textures too)\r\n3. HD - 2K Textures, activate and overwrite any SMIM texture files (depending on your taste)\r\n4. Realistic Overhaul, activate and overwrite any existing textures to make SRO primary.\r\nWith this method will throw together a mix with Realistic Overhaul taking the cake. SRO 1024 v1.2 will overwrite a possible \\\" 440 \\\" HD - 2K Lite textures out of the \\\" 600 \\\" textures HD - 2K Lite provides. HD - 2K Lite would provide \\\" 160 \\\" other textures while SRO 1024 would give \\\" 726 \\\" other textures. That\\'s \\\" 1,326 \\\" new textures all together, excluding any SMIM DDS files.\r\n[color=Hotpink][b]Compile your own assortment:[/b][/color]\r\nBefore you attempt this, may I suggest you install a 1024 res and 2048 res texture mod (both of same mod) into Nexus Mod Manager (NMM). Activate SMIM and then one texture mod to test, launch Skyrim and head to Whiterun. Run around a bit, see how your PC performs. Quit the game and deactivate only the texture mod. Test another and so on. At least this will give you some indication. You may have to use lower resolution 1024 res mods.\r\nA good fast way to view *.dds texture files is [url=http://www.irfanview.com]IrfanView[/url], get the Plugins/AddOns while your there, a plugin provides the DDS view.\r\n[url=http://www.joerg-rosenthal.com/en/antitwin/download.html]Anti-Twin[/url] is made for finding and removing duplicate files. Though I find it useful for comparing the extracted texture files by using only the Compare Names option. The preview doesn\\'t support DDS files, though if you have IrfanView, you can open the DDS from Anti-Twin. What does this mean? Well if you extract, for example:\r\n[size=3][b]- This will take a lot of time (days probably) and you will have to be careful. Once done though, you will have your very own texture customized Skyrim -[/b][/size]\r\n[color=Powderblue]1)[/color] To put together the highest resolution combination, extract these to C:\\\\DDS Compare\\\\\r\na. Skyrim HD - 2K Textures Full, to new folder within DDS Compare\r\nb. Realistic Overhaul 2048K, to new folder within DDS Compare\r\nc. Serious HD Retexture 2048px, to new folder within DDS Compare\r\nd. Chris2012\\'s Whiterun HQ Texture Pack 2048, to new folder within DDS Compare\r\n[color=Powderblue]2)[/color] Open Anti-Twin\r\na. Set the Basic Folder to C:\\\\DDS Compare\r\nb. Click file filter and add \\\"dds\\\" without quotes\r\nc. Deselect Compare content and Select Compare names\r\nd. Set the limit to 50,000 duplicates\r\ne. Start the Search for same names\r\n[color=Powderblue]3)[/color] Takes a long time. Compare the textures\r\na. Mark for deletion those you don\\'t want. Look at the directory structure. Some file names are shared, such as \\\"\\\\textures\\\\dungeons\\\\caves\\\\cavebaseground01_n.dds\\\" and \\\"textures\\\\landscape\\\\cavebaseground01_n.dds\\\". If the image filename has \\\"_n\\\" at the end, it\\'s a Specular shine texture. You will want to keep the corresponding \\\"_n\\\" texture with the same mods similar named texture. See [url=http://cs.elderscrolls.com/index.php/DDS_Files]Construction Set Wiki - DDS Files[/url] for more information about DDS. Delete when your happy and close Anti-Twin\r\nb. Take the texture files from each mod \\\"texture\\\" folder and combine\r\nc. Use your custom combination with Skyrim.\r\n[b]D. Don\\'t forget the mod authors who created the textures. Endorse them if you use their textures. And don\\'t, [color=red]DO NOT[/color], upload your customized texture compilation, as doing so would be theft. Use their textures, not rip them off.[/b]\r\n\r\n[size=4][color=aqua][b]4.-[/b][/color][color=Lightskyblue][b] DDS (texture) Stats for versions specified:[/b][/color][/size]\r\nSMIM v1.19 = 127 total. 10 replaceable via other texture mods.\r\nHD-2K v1.5 Lite = 600\r\nHD-2K v1.5 Full = 600 >\r\n(128 x 128 ; 3) < These sorted by height in IrfanView Thumbnails\r\n(256 x 256 ; 3)\r\n(256 x 512 ; 1)\r\n(512 x 512 ; 21)\r\n(1024 x 512 ; 3)\r\n(1024 x 1024 ; 60)\r\n(2048 x 1024 ; 7)\r\n(512 x 2048 ; 1)\r\n(1024 x 2048 ; 15)\r\n(2048 x 2048 ; 448)\r\n(4096 x 2048 ; 9)\r\n(1024 x 4096 ; 4)\r\n(2048 x 4096 ; 5)\r\n(4096 x 4096 ; 20)\r\n\r\nRealistic Overhaul v1.2 1024K = 1,166\r\nRealistic Overhaul v1.2 2048K = 1,171 (5 extras over 1024K) >\r\n(1024 x 64 ; 4) < These sorted by height in IrfanView Thumbnails\r\n(1024 x 128 ; 2)\r\n(512 x 256 ; 2)\r\n(512 x 512 ; 2)\r\n(1024 x 512 ; 11)\r\n(2048 x 512 ; 2)\r\n(256 x 1024 ; 1)\r\n(512 x 1024 ; 22)\r\n(1024 x 1024 ; 180)\r\n(2048 x 1024 ; 17)\r\n(4096 x 1024 ; 1)\r\n(512 x 2048 ; 2)\r\n(1024 x 2048 ; 19)\r\n(2048 x 2048 ; 900)\r\n(4096 x 2048 ; 2)\r\n(1024 x 4096 ; 2)\r\n(2048 x 4096 ; 2)\r\n\r\nSerious HD Retexture v1.2.3 1024px = 113\r\nSerious HD Retexture v1.2.3 2048px = 113 >\r\n(1024 x 1024 ; 2) < These sorted by height in IrfanView Thumbnails\r\n(2048 x 2048 ; 111)\r\n\r\nChris2012s Whiterun v1.01 1024 = 100\r\nChris2012s Whiterun v1.01 2048 = 100 >\r\n(256 x 256 ; 2) < These sorted by height in IrfanView Thumbnails\r\n(512 x 512 ; 1)\r\n(1024 x 512 ; 1)\r\n(1024 x 1024 ; 2)\r\n(2048 x 1024 ; 4)\r\n(1024 x 2048 ; 13)\r\n(2048 x 2048 ; 76)\r\n(4096 x 4096 ; 1)\r\n\r\n[size=4][color=aqua][b]5.-[/b][/color][color=Lightskyblue][b] Credits:[/b][/color][/size]\r\nSkyrim: [url=http://www.bethsoft.com]Bethesda Softworks[/url]\r\nHigh Resolution Texture Pack (Free DLC): Bethesda Softworks\r\nStatic Mesh Improvement Mod - SMIM: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=283020]Brumbek[/url]\r\nSerious HD Retexture Skyrim: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=3131768]Z4G4[/url]\r\nSkyrim HD - 2K Textures: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=3101794]NebuLa[/url]\r\nSkyrim Realistic Overhaul: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=101278]Starac[/url]\r\nChris2012s Whiterun HQ Texture Pack: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=2587572]Chris2012[/url]",
