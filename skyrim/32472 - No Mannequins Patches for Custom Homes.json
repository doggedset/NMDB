  "summary": "These are simple patches to remove all the vanilla mannequins from a custom player home. I made this because I use other mannequin mods (and because my characters are females), and I'd prefer to replace the vanilla ones with those.

  "descriptionHtml": "[line]\r\n[size=4][color=RoyalBlue]What it is:[/color][/size]\r\nThese are simple patches to remove all the vanilla mannequins from custom player homes. I made this because I use other mannequin mods, and I'd prefer to replace the vanilla ones with those. And also because I think this is a bit of a petty thing to request the original modders to do. :)\r\n\r\nIf you're in a similar situation, then these patches might be useful to you.\r\n\r\nPlease report to me any issues you may have or mistakes I may have made. Thanks.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Contrary to my initial intentions, I'm not planning on supporting more custom homes. If I ever get back to learning how to make mods I may eventually come up with a better solution than this.\r\n\r\n[line]\r\n[size=4][color=RoyalBlue]How to install:[/color][/size]\r\nYou can install it manually, or automatically with NMM. It's better if your last save is not inside the room where the mannequins are. If it is, you'll have to leave the room and go back in after installing this patch, so that the game recognizes the changes it makes.\r\n[list]\r\n\t    [*][size=3][color=LightBlue] Manual Installation:[/color][/size]\r\n\t\t\tClick [color=RoyalBlue]Download manualy[/color], extract the contents of the archive and copy the [color=red]*[/color]NoMannequinsXYZ##.esp file into the '[b]data[/b]' folder inside your skyrim folder. Ignore the fomod folder. It's for NMM users. \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t    [*][size=3][color=green] NMM Installation:[/color][/size]\r\n\t\t\tClick [size=2][color=LightGreen][Download With Manager][/color][/size], then double click it in the Manager to install. If you're installing more than one patch, NMM may complain about different versions and if you want to upgrade: Say No to that.\r\n[/list]\r\n\tAlso make sure this patch's .esp file is below the custom home's .esp file in the mods load order, so that it is loaded AFTER their mod (doesn't matter where in the list it is, as long as it's below it).\r\n\r\n[color=red]*[/color](\"XYZ\" will be the innitials for the related mod's name, and \"##\" is the version number)\r\n\t\r\n[line]\t\r\n[size=4][color=RoyalBlue]Requirements:[/color][/size]\r\nThe custom home mod the specific patch applies to, and its inherent requirements.\r\n\r\n[b][color=LightBlue]Currently supported mods:[/color][/b]\r\n[list][*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31627][color=Khaki]Mist Valley Retreat[/color][/url], by Garkk.\r\n[*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10901][color=Khaki]Dragon Falls Manor[/color][/url], by Mattcm919.\r\n[*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8683][color=Khaki]Amazing Riverwood Starter Home[/color][/url], by Mattcm919.[/list]\r\n\r\n[line]\r\n[size=4][color=RoyalBlue]Compatibility:[/color][/size]\r\nShould not be incompatible with any mods, unless they do anything specificaly with the mannequins from the specific mod the patch applies to, in which case the one loading last will be the one to take effect.\r\n\r\n[line]\t\r\n[size=4][color=RoyalBlue]Credits:[/color][/size]\r\nAll credits and thanks go to the original modders, really. I just removed the mannequins. :)\r\n\t\r\n\tThanks also to [url=http://www.youtube.com/user/GophersVids?feature=watch][color=Khaki]GophersVids[/color][/url] for his very instructive, insightful, and very well presented tutorials on TESVedit, which, indirectly, taught me how to do this.\r\n\r\n[line]\t\r\n[size=4][color=RoyalBlue]Personally Recomended Mods:[/color][/size]\r\n[list][*]I'd recommend a ton of home mods, but my preference goes to [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31627][color=Khaki]Mist Valley Retreat[/color][/url], by Garkk. it's beautiful and practical, especially because it has no loading screens inside it.\r\n[*][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10578][color=Khaki]SPODUM[/color][/url], by SLuckyD (Mannequins mod)[/list]\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n",
