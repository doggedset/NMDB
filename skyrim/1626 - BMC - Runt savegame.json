  "descriptionHtml": "I\\'m not happy with the amount of clones in this game due to the severely (seriously, we can\\'t even adjust nose width?) limited character gen as such I didn\\'t intend to upload saves till we get the CS to fix it but a friend asked me to upload one of them so I figured I may as well.\r\n\r\nThis was my most recent character, I had intended to try mage again but I just fine mages tedious in this so I went as heavy armour with a two hander yet again.\r\n\r\nThis save is immediately after character gen, before you first gain control of your character to allow skill distribution as you see fit.\r\n\r\nIt has to be said I am using some texture mods/fixes as listed below, all available on skyrimnexus.\r\n\r\nNo More Blocky Faces + LUEF patch by Xenius & arlekin\r\nDetailed Faces by Xenius\r\nDetailed Bodies by Xenius\r\nHigh Quality Eyes by Xenius\r\n\r\nI don\\'t use the lips mod however despite testing it so be warned that does change the appearance quite dramatically, I just wanted a more natural un-made up look for characters where I felt the lips mod looked more like lipstick with my settings.",
