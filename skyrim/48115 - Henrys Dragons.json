  "descriptionHtml": "WTF is Henry's Dragons? Well I am glad you asked, I make the mod for myself as I find the dragons lack in vibrance and could use a little more of a warmer colour palette. So that's what I have basically done, I have made them more colourful and also sharper without increasing the texture size for performance. So I thought I might as well put them on here as sharing is caring. Maybe I'll do some HD re-skins if I have the free time too.",
