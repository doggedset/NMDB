  "descriptionHtml": "Crafting Diagram is (yet another) Witcher 3 inspired mod, which aim to redesign the vanilla crafting system.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Instead of magically learning how to create weapons, armors, and other items, you need to find the relevant diagram first.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Diagrams can be be foud individually, or packaged in a holder containing one or more of them. They can be found in the various chest, especially boss ones,or bought from blacksmith, generalist merchants, jewelers, or fletchers.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />You need diagrams in your possession to craft items. They can either hang loose in your inventory, or be stashed in your very own holder.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />You can also give diagrams to craftsman so that they may create the item for you, provided you pay for their services and provide them with required items.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Tempering weapons and armors is left completely independant of the diagrams.",
