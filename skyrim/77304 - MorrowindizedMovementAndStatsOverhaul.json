  "summary": "Alters movement speed of both the player and NPCs based off of race and vampirism status, also tries to make the racials more lore friendly, as well as an attempt to make beast races slightly more realistic.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Those being just some examples, there&#39;s a LOT more modifiers than just those conditions though. The idea of this mod is that whoever uses all of my mods together will have their movement speed determined by a huge degree of factors, which stands in deep contrast to vanilla Skyrim where movement speed is extremely homogeneous across the board. Even the movement speed of NPCs will vary depending on a variety of factors. If you&#39;re a Khajiit Berne Vampire W/O boots using your Berne cooldown ability your fastest you&#39;ll be faster than everything except for Chaurus Hunters and Sabrecats, and have to use said CD to be able to outrun deer. Without said CD you&#39;ll just be faster than everything except Deers, Elk, Chaurus Hunters and Sabrecats, and how well fed you are also effects top speed.\r<br />\r<br />No more being able to outrun giant wild felines like sabrecats, Dwemer Spheres will move much faster as imo they logically should, actually being able to run up to a deer will be a special talent not everyone has, Khajiit vampires will be very hard to outrun unless you are a Khajiit, or select a fast class yourself, and all vampires to some degree will be harder to run away from. And a lot of characters won&#39;t be able to outrun bears or wolves anymore. I also plan to make Fall Damage have a diverse level of scaling based off of similar related factors. Again with my idea of making playing as a vampire,s Khajiit, or Acrobat/swift runner characters feel more like old school TES games again.\r<br />\r<br />And here are the changes of Carry Weight/Starting stats/Starting skills.\r<br />\r<br />Skill Rebalances... Magick/Spellcasting/Enchanting bonuses to Imperials, Orcs and Redguards, have been removed, Speechcraft bonuses removed from Nords, Smithing bonuses on Orcs buffed (They&#39;re supposed to be the best smiths), Speechcraft bonus added to Imperials (They&#39;re supposed to be highly capable of being like super manipulative types), Heavy Armor+Smithing bonus added back to Nords, Heavy+Light armor bonuses added back to Redguards, Illusion bonus removed from Dumner replaced with Archery bonus.\r<br />\r<br />I did this cause it felt to me like the racial stat bonuses in Skyrim contradicted lore of prior TES games way too much, all other skill bonuses have been left the same. All skill bonuses are still just 25+and are the same 125 total points to be balanced. Also carry weight no longer scales with Stamina but more on that in a bit.\r<br />\r<br />Carry Weight...\r<br />\r<br />Dremora: 320.\r<br />Orcs: 280.\r<br />Nords: 265.\r<br />Redguard: 240.\r<br />Dumner: 180.\r<br />Imperial: 150.\r<br />Argonian: 140\r<br />Khajiit: 135.\r<br />Breton: 120.\r<br />Bosmer: 110\r<br />Altmer: 105.\r<br />\r<br />Orcs: Health 85/ Magicka 30 /Stamina 65\r<br />Nords: Health 90/ Magicka 30/Stamina 60.\r<br />Redguard: Health 80/ Magicka 30/Stamina 70.\r<br />Argonian: 65 Health / Magicka 70/Stamina 45.\r<br />Imperial: 75 Health/Magicka 45/Stamina 55\r<br />Khajiit: 55 Health/ Magicka 40/Stamina 85\r<br />Dumner: 60 Health/ Magicka 60/Stamina 60\r<br />Bosmer: 50 Health /Magicka 50 /Stamina 80\r<br />Breton: 45 Health/ Magicka 90/Stamina 45\r<br />Altmer: 40 Health/ Magicka 100/Stamina 40\r<br />\r<br />Khajiit: 10% fire weakness, 10% frost resistance.\r<br />Argonian: 10% frost weakness, 10% fire resistance.\r<br />\r<br />Reason: Argonians are very lizardlike and that Argonian on Solstheim complained of being cold a lot, and\r<br />Khajiit have fur. It might or might not be lore friendly according to some- I personally TRY to balance a\r<br />golden ratio of lore vs gameplay vs realism, and this mod is supposed to be what I see as the golden ratio\r<br />of said balance, hence the reason for that. These 10% weaknesses/strengths are supposed to be slight enough\r<br />to be fairly lore friendly and non intrusive yet prevelant enough to effect gameplay to a slightly noticeable degree\r<br />\r<br />SOME individuals may argue that Argonians cannot be proven to be cold blooded, or that there&#39;s not enough evidence in the lore for me giving Argonians/Khajiit contrasting resistances, though I personally feel that it both doesn&#39;t distinctively contradict the lore, and also is a subtle\r<br /> touch that makes the game feel more realistic, as something IÂ  personally define as realistic in a good way, I don&#39;t think something \r<br />being realistic automatically always makes video games better... \r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s my personal interpretation that Argonians would be slightly more resistant to heat than most races, just absolutely nothing in comparison to Dumner, and that likewise Khajiit would logically be more resistant to the cold due to their fur- just again, their subtle resistance paling in comparison to the frost resistance Nords have. Anyways....\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Skill Rebalances.\r<br />\r<br /> Magick/Spellcasting/Enchanting bonuses to Imperials, Orcs and Redguards, have been removed, Speechcraft bonuses removed from Nords, Smithing bonuses on Orcs buffed (They&#39;re supposed to be the best smiths), Speechcraft bonus added to Imperials (They&#39;re supposed to be highly capable of being like super manipulative types), Heavy Armor+Smithing bonus added back to Nords, Heavy+Light armor bonuses added back to Redguards, Illusion bonus removed from Dumner replaced with Archery bonus.\r<br />\r<br />I did this cause it felt to me like the racial stat bonuses in Skyrim contradicted lore of prior TES games way too much, all other skill bonuses have been left the same. All skill bonuses are still just 25+\r<br />and are the same 125 total points to be balanced.\r<br />\r<br />Carry Weight...\r<br />\r<br />Orcs: 280.\r<br />Nords: 265.\r<br />Redguard: 240.\r<br />Dumner: 180.\r<br />Imperial: 150.\r<br />Argonian: 140\r<br />Khajiit: 135.\r<br />Breton: 120.\r<br />Bosmer: 110\r<br />Altmer: 105.\r<br />Dremora: 320.\r<br />\r<br />Vampire Carry Weight.\r<br />\r<br />Orcs: 320.\r<br />Nords: 285.\r<br />Redguard: 260.\r<br />Dumner: 200.\r<br />Imperial: 170.\r<br />Argonian: 160\r<br />Khajiit: 155.\r<br />Breton: 140.\r<br />Bosmer: 130\r<br />Altmer: 125.\r<br />\r<br />--- Rebalance ----\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Orcs: Health 85/ Magicka 30 /Stamina 65\r<br />Nords: Health 90/ Magicka 30/Stamina 60.\r<br />Redguard: Health 80/ Magicka 30/Stamina 70.\r<br />Argonian: 65 Health / Magicka 70/Stamina 45.\r<br />Imperial: 75 Health/Magicka 45/Stamina 55\r<br />Khajiit: 55 Health/ Magicka 40/Stamina 85\r<br />Dumner: 60 Health/ Magicka 60/Stamina 60\r<br />Bosmer: 50 Health /Magicka 50 /Stamina 80\r<br />Breton: 45 Health/ Magicka 90/Stamina 45\r<br />Altmer: 40 Health/ Magicka 100/Stamina 40\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Bosmer Magicka bonus reason: Bosmer had Alteration/Alchemy bonuses in prior games in spite of identical intelligence to Khajiit, so gave Bosmer just a tiny Magicka boost still less than a Dumners. Khajiit arguably had slightly higher endurance than Bosmer I think it makes they&#39;d be slightly tougher than Bosmer. Since Imperials have magic bonuses in Skyrim, yet Khajiit never had any Imperials have slightly more magic than Khajiit, since Bosmer had Alchemy/Alteration bonuses in multiple TES games and they&#39;re Mer they have slightly more Magicka than Imperials.\r<br />\r<br />A lot of things about vanilla Skyrim&#39;s racial stats feel like they contradict the lore of Oblivion, Morrowind and Daggerfall- it&#39;s never been TYPICAL in prior TES games for Orcs, Redguards, or Imperials to be Mages hence I choose to abstain to base things off of Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Dumner Safe Fall: 10%\r<br />Redguard Safe Fall: 15%\r<br />Bosmer Safe Fall: 20%\r<br />Khajiit Safe Fall: 25%\r<br />Vampire Safe Fall: 30%\r<br />Dumner Safe Fall: 32%\r<br />Redguard Safe Fall: 33%\r<br />Bosmer Vampire Safe Fall: 35%\r<br />Khajiit Vampire Safe Fall: 40%\r<br />Berne Vampire Safe Fall: 40%.\r<br />\r<br />Altmer/Bretons: 100% movement speed.\r<br />Argonian: 101% movement speed.\r<br />Imperial/Nord/Orc: 102% extra movement speed.\r<br />Dumner: 103% movement speed.\r<br />Redguard: 104% movement speed.\r<br />Bosmer: 105% movement speed.\r<br />Breton/Altmer Vampires: 105% movement speed.\r<br />\r<br />Vampires: 107% movement speed.\r<br />Khajiit: 107% movement speed.\r<br />Dumner Vampire: 108% movement speed.\r<br />Redguard Vampire: 109% movement speed.\r<br />Dremora Movement Speed: 109% .\r<br />Bosmer vampire: 110% extra movement speed.\r<br />Khajiit Vampire: 115% extra movement speed.\r<br />Flame Atronach speed: 115%.\r<br />Bear movement speed: 115% \r<br />\r<br />Dwemer Sphere movement speed: 135%.\r<br />Bunny/Rabbit movement speed: 148%.\r<br />Werewolf movement speed: 175% \r<br />Wolf Movement speed: 180%\r<br />Deer Movement speed: 205%\r<br />Flying Chaurus movement: 225%.\r<br />Sabrecat movement Speed: 288% movement speed.\r<br />\r<br />One version will include all my mods that bring back a taste of Morrowind combined into one, and the other version will be modular, not including content from my other mods.",
