  "descriptionHtml": "Description\r\n===========\r\nSolstheim – The Lost Levels is an add-on for the Dragonborn DLC that adds 6 caves, 8 plants, 1 book and 4 quests. The content is based on The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and its expansion, Bloodmoon.\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n========\r\nThe caves are dungeons that were featured in Bloodmoon, but aren’t present in Dragonborn. They’ve been spread out across Solstheim, generally near their original position. They have been set up with all the information needed by Skyrim\\'s radiant quest system.\r\n\r\nThe new plants are mostly native to Morrowind, but some plants indigenous to Solstheim as it is portrayed in Bloodmoon are also included. They’ve been added to leveled lists and placed on the island, replacing the flora that you already know from Skyrim.\r\n\r\nThere are also four quests related to the new locations. You may receive them from the following NPCs:\r\n-Captain Veleth in Raven Rock, after completing March of the Dead\r\n-Edla in the Skaal Village, after completing her quest involving Nikulas\r\n-Elynea in Tel Mythrin, after completing Healing a House\r\n-Neloth in Tel Mythrin, after completing Reluctant Steward\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\nIn the distant past, a modder by the name of Ionisthebear worked on a Skyrim mod known as Solstheim 4E. When it was revealed that there would be a DLC set on Solstheim, he abandoned the project. He had already completed the exterior world and a number of dungeons. He repurposed the custom assets for Northpoint and the landscape for Hircine’s Hunting Grounds, but the finished interiors were sitting idly by, so Ionis gave me permission to implement them as a Dragonborn add-on.\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more about Northpoint or Hircine\\'s Hunting Grounds, visit this blog:\r\nhttp://beyondmodding.blogspot.co.uk/\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\nThe archive has a simple structure. You can choose one of the following install methods:\r\n1. Extract the contents of the archive to steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\data\\\\ or install using your favourite mod manager\r\n2. Start the launcher, click \\'Data Files\\', place a checkmark beside \\\"Solstheim - The Lost Levels.esp\\\". Or use your favourite mod manager.\r\n3. If your game crashes on startup, that probably means that you haven\\'t purchased or enabled Dragonborn.\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\nMake sure that you did not save your game inside one of the areas added by this mod. Otherwise, you will be booted back to the Sleeping Giant Inn.\r\n\r\nDelete the following files:\r\ndata\\\\Solstheim - The Lost Levels.esp\r\ndata\\\\Solstheim - The Lost Levels.bsa\r\ndata\\\\Solstheim - The Lost Levels.bsl\r\n\r\nThe mod does not contain any scripts, so uninstalling should be relatively safe.\r\n\r\nUpgrade\r\n=======\r\nUpgrading should be error-free. Simply copy the new files over the old ones.\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nThis mod adds some stuff to a few of the leveled lists added by Dragonborn; you may need to use the Bashed Patch in Wrye Bash if you have other mods that change ingredient lists and/or loot on Solstheim.\r\n\r\nThe cave entrances added by this mod are rather large, so take care if another mod adds geometry on Solstheim, or they might collide.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nNone as far as I know. However, if you experience \\\"blue voids\\\", i.e. large portions of geometry being invisible, notify me at once, because that\\'s some code red shit.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n1.0, 2013/03/19 - Initial release.\r\n1.1, 2013/03/22 - Removed landscape edits and additional ITMS\r\n1.2, 2013/05/13 - Added Domme\r\n1.3, 2013/05/17 - Added quests\r\n1.3a,2013/05/20 - Optimization and bugfixes\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nYou can find me on Skyrim Nexus, Dark Creations and the official forums as \\'Thingy Person\\'\r\nYou can find Ionis on Dark Creations as \\'Ionisthebear\\'\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nIonisthebear: Creating the interior locations, feedback, troubleshooting.\r\nThe TES5Edit team: for creating an invaluable modding tool.\r\n\r\nTools Used\r\n==========\r\nCreation Kit\r\nTES5Edit - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25859/\r\nReadme Generator - http://HammondsLegacy.com/obmm/tools_readme_generator1.asp\r\nMicrosoft OneNote\r\n\r\nLicensing/Legal\r\n===============\r\nDo not modify and redistribute, or upload to other sites without my (Thingy Person\\'s) permission.\r\n\r\nIf I don\\'t reply within two weeks, contact Ionisthebear instead.\r\n\r\nIf he doesn\\'t reply, it\\'s better to do nothing at all.",
