  "summary": "Fixes a few bugs with 2 of the summons, all being 1 handed warriors class wise but 2 of the them use 2 handed weapons so I changed the classes to two handed warriors and tweaked it so they scale at the player level when they are summoned, so usable in high level play.",

They are still rather squishy with skyre, but its at least an option for non conjurers now to have a summon when needed. :)\r\n\r\nJust place towards bottom of your load order, only tweaks to those 3 npc, no other changes in the mod and should be compatible with most mods and work with the vanilla game.",
