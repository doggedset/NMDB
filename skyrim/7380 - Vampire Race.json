Hate having to contract the Sanguinare Vampiris diease? Well good news. This mod adds a new race into the game. The Vampire race. It has all the effects of the normal Sanguinare Vampiris. But now you can start right off as one.\r\n\r\nAlso added a new race called the Lycans. Im sure your wondering Lycans? Well im a huge fan of the underworld movies and since they added Werewolfs into the game i figured id make a race for them. I added a spell that allows you to transform into a Werewolf any time you chose too.\r\n\r\nRight now its only a Human vampire. But i do plan to add a Vampire race for all the default races. Enjoy.\r\n\r\nFully works with any body mod you may have installed. But i plan to make it use DIMONIZED UNP female body.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://img444.imageshack.us/img444/2482/installa.png[/img][/center]\r\nCopy the archive content into your x:\\\\TESV Skyrim\\\\Data folder, when asked overwrite.
