  "descriptionHtml": "---Description and what it does---\r\nI, as many others, have encountered bugs, regarding the \\\\\\\"quick reflex\\\\\\\" perk such as: \r\n\r\nDestroying the shield experience with no stopping slow motions or slow motion when you aren\\\\\\'t even using a shield.\r\n\r\nI tried a lot of ways to fix this with console, and some times it helped, but usually only for a very short time, so I got pissed. Now I made this mod to fix this extremely annoying issue, by altering the quick reflex magic effect. Now the effect won\\\\\\'t do anything, and that\\\\\\'s the point of the mod, so even if the perk do go on, you won\\\\\\'t notice due to the fact that the perk basically doesn\\\\\\'t do anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n---Installation---\r\nJust download it with NMM. If you want to do it manually, do so.\r\n\r\n---Note---\r\nI did try to reset the perk, remove and add it. I tried a lot of ways. Tried another esp by someone, but it didn\\\\\\'t work. This should work. It have worked for me for the latest hour.",
