  "descriptionHtml": "Hallo guys, this is my very first mod, this was quite hardy to make due to my intermediate english but it\\'s done now. I change the poor gray metal tone for an intense black one, also i put 100% of light in the small golden figures to give more detail. It was only for myself cause this game has low resolution textures, meshes, etc. Hope you like it guys, sincerely.",
