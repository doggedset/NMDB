  "descriptionHtml": "[heading][color=red][b]Durny the Skeever Follower[/color][/b][/heading]\r<br />\r<br />Durny is a unique skeeever follower found in the Alchemist&#39;s Shack in the Rift. He is essential, doesn&#39;t affect your sneak meter and will even carry your stuff for you&#33; He even levels with you and doesn&#39;t mind if you tell him to wait behind. He is suitable for beginner characters, right up to Level 30.\r<br />\r<br />I made this mod for my own use, but figured I would share it anyway. It is also quite personal to me, since the skeever is named after my baby rat, Durnehviir, who recently passed. Here&#39;s a photo of him:\r<br />\r<br />[IMG]http://i39.tinypic.com/2iks8t5.jpg[/IMG]\r<br />\r<br />So, yeah. Use if you like.\r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]===[b]Installation:[/b]====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Just drop the file into your data folder. Or use the NMM. \r<br />To uninstall, just remove the file. \r<br />\r<br />[color=darkorange]=====[b]Permissions and Credits[/b]=====[/color]\r<br />\r<br />This mod is not to be uploaded anywhere but the Skyrim Nexus. Please report to me if you see this anywhere else. I will allow editing, if notified.\r<br />Thanks to Bethesda for creating a great game and letting us fiddle with it. \r<br />\r<br />[color=red]Thanks for reading and check my page for more mods&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/7065334/?tb=mods&pUp=1 ] [IMG]http://i42.tinypic.com/2dryws3.png[/IMG][/url]",
