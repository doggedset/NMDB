  "descriptionHtml": "UPDATE: Version 1.1\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n-Reduced the attack speed from 0.7 to 0.5 to better accommodate the immense weight of the scythe\r\n\r\nThe Scythe of Reaper Night Blade, inspired by a weapon I\\'ve received in Dungeons and Dragons 3.5!\r\n\r\nLore (Feel free to skip this, but I\\'d appreciate it if you read it):\r\n\r\nLong ago in the world of Thebea there lived a warrior that went by the alias \\\"Reaper Night Blade.\\\" His weapon of choice, a cursed scythe. The scythe bore an immense power that would lay waste to any foe that stood before him, but there was a downside to this scythe. The scythe was cursed with an enormous weight that only the  mightiest of warriors could wield. In time, Reaper Night Blade perished and his Scythe was hidden in a tomb. \r\n\r\nThis is the first mod I\\'ve ever made, I feel it\\'s turned out relatively well, although many improvements can be made to it. This is a beta version of the weapon, if I get good feedback on what the scythe currently is, and/or good feedback on how I can improve it, I will do so and continue to update this mod. If not, I\\'ll abandon the mod entirely.\r\n\r\nKnown: Issues:\r\n1) The Specular map is there, but appears uncooperative. The entire weapon has a bronze-like shimmer to it. This will be fixed either when I get around to it, or if someone else wishes to take it upon themselves.\r\n2) There are some holes in them mesh of the blade, this WILL be fixed in a future update.\r\n3) The normal map also appears to be uncooperative. I\\'ll see what I can do to fix this.\r\n4) Any other issues that have yet to cross my attention, if anyone discovers any, please say so in the comments section.\r\n\r\nTo-Do List:\r\n1) Fix specular and normal map problems\r\n2) Improve the overall texture of the scythe (I\\'ve never been very good at texturing)\r\n3) Create a quest to obtain the scythe.\r\n\r\nFor now the scythe can be crafted under the Daedric category in the Smithing menu.\r\n\r\nCrafting Materials:\r\n3 Firewood\r\n4 Leather\r\n5 Ebony Ingots\r\n\r\nMods used in images:\r\nPauldrons_Morrowind Style - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26617\r\nLore-Friendly Darksiders War Armor-Weapons Set - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14392\r\nBandolier - Bags and Pouches - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16438\r\nipHUD - Complete Edition v2  - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4210\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\nNONE! Other than the latest version of Skyrim, but I\\'m sure any version will do.",
