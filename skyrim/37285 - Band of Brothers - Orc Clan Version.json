  "descriptionHtml": "Name: Band of Brothers Orc Clan Version\r\nVersion: 1\r\nDate: 6/16/2013\r\nCategory: Follower, Companion, Squad Command\r\nAuthor: KnightRangersGuild\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nBand of Brothers Orc Clan Version is the counterpart of the original, I made this by request. http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32823/? .\r\n\r\nThis is a squad based follower mod, you command 4 Officers that each have 5 followers of their own. Their is 10 Archers, 10 Infantry, 1 Wizard, 1 Bard and 4 Officers.\r\nThey are all allies, and you can recruit each one individually if you want but it is better to use the Officers.\r\nThis mod has been fully cleaned and tested with 200+ mods.\r\n\r\nStory\r\n=====\r\nThe Band of Brothers Orc Clan are a bunch of rag-tag rebel Orcs who were dissbannded because they stood up against corruption in the Orcish army. They raised their voice against torcher and the burning of villages and the killing of women and children. They are wanted dead or alive bye the Orcish Legion for helping and aiding their ememies.\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n=======\r\nTheir stronghold is located somewhere north of Falkreath, near the lake.\r\n \r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\n\r\n1.  Command a faithful army.\r\n2.  Recruit 1 or all 26 or just the officers and their men will follow them!\r\n3.  Infantry and Archers respawn but Officers do not!\r\n4.  Infantry and Archers ignore stealth meter but Officers do not!\r\n5.  Give them whatever armor and weapons you want but they come with their own gear!\r\n6.  At first they will not be wearing there gear but if you take a piece of armor from them and then give it back they will wear it.\r\n7.  When your done with them then just dismiss them and they will march in single file back to their stronghold!\r\n8.  Strategically place your squads for an ambush!\r\n9.  Works great with UFO but have not tested it with AFT so let me know.\r\n10. You can command the officers and their men will follow them!\r\n11. YOU NEED A MOD THAT ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE FOLLOWER! UFO or SOMETHING\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n1. This should work fine with NMM.\r\n2. Manual download- Extract the files to a temporary location. Copy the files to \\\\Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\ or steam steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\n1. Remove all your stuff out of their inventory, Then, in data files, Uncheck and delete.\r\nIf you need to delete everything that came with this mod then do this.... examine the contents of the whole mod folder and delete all\r\nthe corresponding files.\r\n2. Or use Nexusmodmanager\r\n\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nIt will be incompatible with mods that mod the same area.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nNone, Fully tested with 200+mods and cleaned with Tes5Edit.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nKnightRangersGuild on Skyrimnexus or KnightRangersGuild@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim and the Creation Kit.\r\n\r\n\r\nTools Used\r\n==========\r\nSkyrim Creation kit",
