The island has a working worldmap with fast travel. There are no quests, just a new place to explore (though you can probably figure out what direction the story would go). To reach the island, find one of the three books scattered around Skyrim (see the images for exact locations), and to leave, find another book hidden on the island (aka kill the boss). These books can be read anytime, but will NOT bring your follower with you to the island.\n<br />\n<br /> [color=Aqua] [size=5]Update (v1.0)[/size][/color]\n<br />--&gt;Got the LOD (and worldmap) mostly working\n<br />--&gt;Fully navmeshed the island\n<br />\n<br /> [color=Aqua] [size=5]Installation[/size][/color] \n<br />\n<br />[color=red] Skyrim must be updated to the latest patch[/color]\n<br />\n<br />Via NMM or Mod Organizer: Everything follows the basic procedure.\n<br />Manually: Again, follow standard procedure, just drag, drop, and merge.\n<br />\n<br />[color=aqua]Uninstall Info:[/color]\n<br />Remove any object added by the mod from any inventories or containers you care about (just to be safe), and remove as usual.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5] [color=Red] Warnings/Troubleshooting/Things to Know[/color] [/size]\n<br />\n<br />You can't save in the exterior spaces and load back in there (but you can in any interior space). Currently if you save in the exteriors and load that save, the game will dump you in Riverwood.\n<br />\n<br />If you travel back to the island after leaving it, ensure you bring the book to leave with you, otherwise you will have to coc out.\n<br />\n<br />The new welkynd stones function mostly like a torch does, but can be a little buggier. To fix any strange animations, just draw a weapon and everything will work. Also, the welkynd stones will not glow when dropped until you save and quit (this has to do with how vanilla torches are implemented in the game).\n<br />\n<br />The dwemer towers don't fully appear in the worldmap.\n<br />\n<br />If you check, the mod does have a dirty edit, but it will not affect anything, and is part of the CK LOD generation.\n<br />\n<br />Setting uGrids higher will definitely improve the appearance of the mod, but you should obviously be careful if you do so.\n<br />\n<br /> [color=Aqua] [size=5]Credits[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/user/793890-tamb0] Tamb0 [/url]and [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/user/624800-elijahhouck/] ElijahHouck [/url] for problem solving\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/2771094-turtlelover25] TurtleLover25 [/url] for motivating me to pick-up work again on the mod\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19066] HoddminirGroundTextures by elinen [/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23828#] Adabala Building System - Ayleid Transfusion by Varlaisaran [/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/file/1330-the-tesa-skyrim-resource-kit-project] Ayleid Clutter by InsanitySorrow via TESAlliance Skyrim Resource Kit [/url]\n<br />\n<br /> [color=Aqua] [size=5]Recommended Mods[/size][/color] \n<br />\n<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3288]Â [/url][url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/41076]Real Water Two [/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />By[color=aqua] BWchief117 (or bw117) [/color]\n<br />[url=https://rd.nexusmods.com/users/2676350?tab=user+files] [img]http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/images/110/2676350-1386747147.jpg[/img] [/url]",
