  "descriptionHtml": "Name: A Breton Destruction Mage follower Danthalihan\r\nVersion: 1.0\r\nDate: 30/May/2012\r\nCategory: Companions\r\nRequired : Apachii SkyHair \r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168\r\nRecommended: Nexus  Mod Manager\r\nAuthor: eamico\r\nSource: http://www.tesnexus.com\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I apologize for my bad English.  \r\n\r\nIntroduction.\r\nSince Oblivion, I always desired to have mu custom companions. Unfortunately, my scripting skill was not enough to manage a decent and stable script, so I was forced to use CM Companion Mod to have custom NPC  by my side, helping me in fighting Daedra. I was not too happy, but this was enough for me. Today, I am in condition to do my followers for Skyrim.  I like to share them with community. \r\nThis is one of them. \r\nI hope you can enjoy travelling Skyrim in good company. \r\n    \r\nDescription\r\n===========\r\nThis mod adds to the Skyrim Gameworld a female Breton Destruction Mage named Danthalihan that can be found in Drunken Huntsman in Whirerun.\r\nShe can be married.\r\nThere are 2 versions: Not essential and essential.\r\nUse only one version!\r\n\r\nHelp, endorsement and screenshots are welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n========\r\nDrunken Huntsman in Whirerun. \r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\nThis is my second mage follower.\r\nIf anyone can remember my Oblivion\\'s Danthalian mage companion, will be happy to have her company again.\r\nDanthalihan has her own Class, as well as her own combat style, and a set of twin special magical steel daggers in her inventory that can be also crafted at Skyforge and improved like any original weapon, and also a good staff. She is essentially a very powerful destructon mage, and it is better to make her part of a team of followers; I use her toghether with one archer and one warrior follower. \r\nTalking about combat skills, light armour, destruction spells and staffs are preferred, in particular a combination of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhith precision:\r\nShe can level up with player from level 5 to level 100.\r\nVoice: Female Even Toned .\r\nClass: Combat Mage Danthalihan. (Custom)\r\nCombat Style: Danthalihan Magic. (Custom)\r\n\r\nBasic stats at level 5:\r\nOne-handed   17\r\nTwo-handed   15\r\nArchery      15\r\nBlock        15\r\nSmithing     15\r\nHeavy Armour 15\r\nLight Armour 17\r\nPickpocket   15\r\nSneak        19\r\nAlchemy      20\r\nSpeech       20\r\nAlteration   25\r\nConjuration  29\r\nDestruction  21\r\nIllusion     22\r\nRestoration  27\r\nEnchanting   15\r\n\r\nSpeed       100\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can discuss until tomorrow about the look of this NPC. I don\\'t think that it is important. This is a follower mod, so it is important, in my opinion, to focus efforts on functions of the NPC, not on the look. If possible, it is right  to give a good appearance to new followers, but it is a secondary thing.\r\nShe will help you in your travels. This is the goal. \r\nShe live in Drunken Huntsman and there she will come back when dismissed. I like this function, I will not change it. \r\nThere are 2 versions of this file. You must choose only one, according to your preferences.\r\n\r\nI use these mods to help functions of my followers:\r\n\r\n1) multFollowers0.4b; it is useful bo build a team of followers.\r\n\r\n2) CM Companion Level Mod; here is the link:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13790\r\nThis mod will update the companion\\'s skills to their current level to keep pace with the player, so they will ever be good fighters.\r\n\r\n3) Ask Follower Skill; here is the link:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10675\r\nThis mod can make you know all abilities of your followers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my system are installed these aesthetic  mods:\r\n\r\nCBBE V3 (standard body) and the hip texture compatability pack:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\n\r\nBella\\'s Better Females version 3:\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\n\r\nCover Eyes (eyes 1 file):\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=4869\r\n\r\nJoseph Anthonys Lip Gloss for Better Females by Joseph Anthony\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13860\r\n\r\nNo More Blocky Faces by Xenius\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=30\r\n\r\nIf you don\\'t use this combination of mods, her look will be different from the look of the screenshots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n=======\r\n\r\nI like very much Nexus Mod Manager, it is perfect for me. I suggest to use it, but....your choice.\r\n\r\nPick which method you are going to use for installation:\r\n\r\nNexus Mod Manager Installation\r\n- = or = -\r\nManual installation \r\n\r\nNexus Mod Manager installation:\r\nDownload the file with Nexus Mod Manager. Activate it. Done.\r\n\r\nManual Installation:\r\nPlace the zip file\\'s contents into your Skyrim/data folder to install and be sure to activate the ESP and ESM files in your Data Files listing.\r\n\r\nNMM downloading problem.\r\nI have seen that in early hours after uploading a file, NMM can not give the possibility to download new files using the button \\\"download with manager\\\". An error message says that file do not exist. After one or two hours, the problem is automatically solved. I don\\'t know why this happens, maybe it is related to high traffic that Nexus server is forced to tolerate. \r\n\r\nIn this case, you can follow these instructions:  \r\n1) Download the file manually.\r\n2) Open NMM.\r\n3) Hit the black arrow located in the left high button and choose \\\" Add Mod from file\\\".\r\n4) Locate and select the file that you have downloaded manually. \r\n5) Hit \\\"open\\\" button.\r\n6) From Mod\\'s  list, select the created file and activate it. Done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstall\r\n=========\r\nPick which method you are going to use for uninstall based on how you installed it:\r\n\r\nNexus Mod Manager Uninstall\r\n- = or = -\r\nManual Uninstall\r\n\r\nNexus Mod Manager Uninstall\r\nOpen Nexus mod Manager and deactivate the file EADanthalihan. Done.\r\n\r\n\r\nManual Uninstall\r\n\r\nRemove the zip file\\'s contents from your Skyrim/data folder to uninstall and be sure to deactivate the ESP and ESM files in your Data Files listing.\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n\r\nUpgrade\r\n=======\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0 is first version of this file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncompatibility\r\n===============\r\nNone known.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues or Bugs\r\n====================\r\nSamhair has an hairstyle taken from Apachii SkyHair; if you have not installed it, your game will CTD. \r\nIf you decide to marry her, it is better to tell her where she can live with you BEFORE she leaves the temple in Riften.\r\nThis follower was developed to work with Multi followers, CM Companion Level mod and Ask Follower Skills. Running it with these mods means keeping it clear and bug free.\r\nThis do not means that it can\\'t be used under UFO;  I haven\\'t UFO, so I cannot say what can happen if you use it under UFO itself.\r\nTalking of load order, it is fundamental to run this file AFTER UFO itself, this can avoid best part of eventual problems.\r\nI can\\'t see any reason to develop a version specifically to run with UFO. If my files are clear without it, eventual problems are to be considered of UFO itself, not mine. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also download my other mods:\r\n\r\nA Nord Warhammer follower Ithilwhen\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=16651\r\n\r\nA Cute Redguard Follower Calypso\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13744\r\n\r\nA Nord Warrior Follower Shanya\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12893\r\n\r\nA Wood Elf Archer follower Glaween\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13258\r\n\r\nA Wood Elf Ranger follower Sharwyn\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15940\r\n\r\nA Woodelf Archer follower Cinthowen\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15198\r\n\r\nA Breton Witchunter follower Samhair\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17165\r\n\r\nA Dunmer Dual Wielder follower Bleedhan\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=17639\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n1.0, 2012/May/30 - Initial release.\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\nYou can find me on TESNexus as eamico\r\nYou can send me an email here: eamico@tiscali.it\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for creating Skyrim.\r\nThanks to TESNexus.com for the a one-stop-shop resource for authors and players.\r\nSpecial thanks to Blackie for his CM New Companions mod that includes a top-notch detailed tutorial on how to create Skyrim companions without the face discoloration bug.
