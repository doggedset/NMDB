  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/7693-4-1328291518.gif[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[B][SIZE=4]Hello dear Skyrim comrade-in-arms,[/SIZE][/B]\r\n\r\n[I]Just another Nightingale armor? Why? There a lot other mods, a few of them looks much better than yours.[/I]\r\n\r\nThese questions are entitled. The answer is that this is not just a texture replacer. It is not just one armor set. \r\nIt is not just a recipe to craft the given vanilla Nightingale armor. But what is it then?\r\n[LIST]\r\n[*]13 complete armor sets (male/female), all with a custom selfmade shield,\r\n[*]7 heavy armor sets in Iron-, Steel-, Dwarven-, Orcish-, Ebony-, Daedric-, Dragonplate- smithing category,\r\n[*]6 light armor sets in Hide-, Leather-, Elven-, Scaled-, Glass-, Dragonscale- smithing category,\r\n[*]All armor sets completely craftable, improvable and can be enchanted,\r\n[*]Uses Killer Keos skimpy female Nightingale armor meshes,\r\n[*]Calientes CBBE v.3.0 (even silly huge) meshes and textures are fully supported (not included),\r\n[*]Balacing bugs (daedric<->dragonplate) of vanilla Skyrim fixed for new armors,\r\n[*]Does not change anything of Vanilla-Skyrim - full independent mod, no conflicts possible,\r\n[*]Even vanilla meshes & textures are untouched, normal NPCs Nightingale outfit doesn\\'t change,\r\n[*]You can use any other Nightingale armors / texture replacers simultaneous, no conflicts, no overwrites to be afraid,\r\n[*]You could even use this mod to make other texture replacers craftable, because meshes are not changed,\r\n[*]Black® Nightingale armors are well balanced, not overpowered at all, only lightly improved,\r\n[*]Not 4 or 5, but 130 new recipes, 65 new forge recipes, 65 new recipes for the armor table,\r\n[*]No hair & beard issues like you have with simple texture replacers, just changing meshes and textures isnt enough,\r\n[*]But all this doesn\\'t count, most important: With Black®Ware your are always looking cool, from the very beginning![/LIST]\r\n\r\nPS: please excuse my bad English.\r\n\r\nIf this mod is not working for you, please write a comment at Nexus.\r\n \r\n[B][SIZE=5][COLOR=Red]If you like this mode, please vote/endorse for me at Nexus.[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/7693-1-1328291517.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[COLOR=Red][SIZE=6][B]Coming soon: Black® Craftable Underwear[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR] \r\n[URL=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5842][IMG]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/images/5842-1-1328303110.gif[/IMG][/URL]\r\n\r\n[B][SIZE=4]Adult-warning:[/SIZE][/B]\r\n \r\nThis release is not fully adult-safe yet, because only CBBE SH 2.0 (sexy huge - not silly huge) is supported. Due to missing adequate CBBE 3.0 SSH (super sexy huge) skimpy meshes from KillerKeo. Certainly when Killer Keo updates his meshes to full support CBBE 3.0 SSH standards, this mod will be updated to be full \\\"NO MA\\'AM certified\\\". Al Bundy and i can\\'t wait for it.\r\n\r\n[B][SIZE=4]Alpha-warning:[/SIZE][/B]\r\n \r\n[B]Software Unlimited[/B] releases are always intend to be as perfect as possible. All thinks works fine as descriped. But bugs happen. I am alone and didn\\'t even finish my first Skyrim game yet, so I couldn\\'t test all armor pieces long time. It\\'s simply too much for one person. So please don\\'t be sad if something is not working for you. Of course using this mod won\\'t destroy yous saves or something like that. But it could be that e.g. armor disappears after dropping to flor, having wrong texture, the baird/hair are shown over the hood, somes values are not correct, well something like that could happen. \r\n \r\nThe other reason, why 13 Black® Nightingales HD is still alpha because it\\'s simple work in progress: \r\n[LIST]\r\n[*]Future versions will be rebalanced completely in the use of crafting materials. Coming up mod Black® Crafting (that provides new materials, ingots, wools, cottons, dozens of new recipes), will be set as necessary master file for this mod, so in future only custom new components (that must be crafted theirself) will be the source of Black® Nightingale armors.\r\n[*]I plan to cobmine this mod with 18 Black® Katanas and coming up mod 9 Black® Nightingale Bows\r\n[*]New textures are nice, but only a quick and dirty solution. I have to improve them too.\r\n[*]I was not able to test this mod without CBBE nude mod, because playing Skyrim without CBBE is waste of time for me. :D But it functions well with the nevernude version of the CBBE mod.\r\n[*]Not all languages are supported with this release. Future translations depend on support of other users by translating this mod for me completely.[/LIST] \r\n\r\n[B][SIZE=4]Conflicts:[/SIZE][/B]\r\n \r\nAs long as another mod does not use same FORM-IDs as my mod no conflicts are possible, because this mod doesn\\'t modify any vanilla Skyrim records or values, it adds new custom records with the ESP. All meshes and textures are custom and stored in new custom path locations. No INI-files or other configuration files are affected or changed. No global variables of Skyrim are changed. So really nothing to be afraid of. Well if you uninstall you loose all your new custom Black® Nightingale armor parts, but hey, I hope you won\\'t do that.\r\n \r\n[B][SIZE=4]Install/Uninstall:[/SIZE][/B]\r\n \r\nWith Nexus Mod Manager. Don\\'t forget to enable [B][I]13 Black® Nightingales.esp[/I][/B].\r\nFor manual installation see included Readme \r\n\r\nEspecially thanks to [URL=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=3287988]TheFigment[/URL] and [URL=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=84375]Maboroshi Daikon[/URL], so if you like to endorse or vote for this file, you should go to their pages and endorse them for their great work. Without great tools no mod developer could make mods for you, so please endorse this, even if you are not mod developer.\r\n\r\n[URL=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=3654]Female Skimpy Meshes[/URL] based on the great work of  [URL=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=1856479]Killer Keo [/URL]\r\n\r\nThis mod fully supports Calientes great mod CBBE v3.0, but it doesn\\'t use any parts of it, and CBBE is not required but very urgently recommended. \r\n\r\nThis mod takes the huge version (that isnt silly at all) of CBBE as default, normal version is also supported. Slim versions are not supported at all and will never do. Converting this mod for smaller boobs is disallowed at any circumstances, for now and ever.\r\n \r\n[B][SIZE=4]Change-Log:[/SIZE][/B]\r\n[B][SIZE=3]1.00[/B]\r\n[LIST]\r\n[*]Initilal Release[/LIST] [/SIZE]\r\n\r\n[B][SIZE=4]EMAIL: BlackSkyrimMods (at) googlemail.com[/SIZE][/B]\r\n[I][SIZE=1](cripled to prevent spam, sorry for that)[/SIZE][/I]\r\n \r\n[B]Last Update: 03.02.2012[/B]\r\n \r\n[COLOR=Red][B][SIZE=5]Black® Widowmaker - Software Unlimited®[/SIZE][/B][/COLOR]\r\n \r\n[SIZE=1]Black® is not a color - its a-way-of-life-trademark of Black® Widowmaker - Software Unlimited® \r\nEven my humor is Black®![/SIZE]",
