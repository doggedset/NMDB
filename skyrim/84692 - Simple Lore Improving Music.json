  "descriptionHtml": " Not my English native language. Therefore I apologize for possible difficulties.\r<br />\r<br />It very much, very small mod. It does not add to music from Skyrim of anything new, only does little changes as a path.\r<br />Namely - interchanges the position of Mus_explore_day_06 and mus_explore_day_01.\r<br />Or completely replaces mus_explore_day_01 with mus_explore_day_06 if you, as well as I am irritated already by sad mus_explore_day_01.\r<br />\r<br />I considered vanilla archive of music in Skyrim recently.\r<br />I was shocked, I do not remember path mus_explore_day_06.\r<br />It seems to me that I never heard it. O_O\r<br />It is ridiculous.\r<br />For me, it is associated with the game &#34;Black Desert Online&#34;, than from Skyrim more. Though it is an original track from the Skyrim.\r<br />But... This track is matchless&#33;&#33;&#33; I want to hear it in Skyrim&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Yesterday I opened a subject who asked people - I only who never heard this song earlier?\r<br />And 50% of people told that they too never heard it in the Skyrim...\r<br />\r<br />To listen to the song in video to understand - about what tracks I speak. If you the ardent supporter of Vanilla of music if you want to hear more often in Skyrim, this of fashions for you.\r<br />\r<br /> Installation:\r<br /> Place contents of archive (Data folder) in your folder with game, confirm merge\r<br /> of folders, replacement of files (if already changed music in the Skyrim)",
