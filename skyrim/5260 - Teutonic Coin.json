  "descriptionHtml": "Teutonic Coin version 1.0\r\nA MOD for TES V: Skyrim by LieutenantHawk\r\n\r\nAfter seeing all of the modern coin retextures of Skyrim\\'s septims, I decided to do one as well. I think it looks fitting enough for the land of Skyrim.\r\n\r\n\r\n--{Features}--\r\n\r\nA retexture of the septim coins, done using a photograph of a real one. It\\'s a Medieval coin, the type used by the Teutonic Order during its reign over East Prussia and other territories in northeastern Europe. \r\n\r\nUPDATE: The coin has been retextured to include a proper reverse side. Thanks to Profd for pointing it out for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n--{Installation}--\r\n\r\nCopy the \\\"Textures\\\" folder into your \\\"Skyrim\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\" folder. If you are prompted to overwrite files, say \\\"yes.\\\" \r\n\r\n\r\n--{Bugs/Conflicts}--\r\n\r\nIt\\'s not combatible with other coin retextures, obviously, but that\\'s it.\r\n\r\n\r\n--{Copyright}--\r\n\r\nNo distribution or alteration without my permission.\r\n\r\n\r\n--{Credits}--\r\n\r\nBethesda Softworks for making Skyrim, of course. Coin photo is from an unknown source. Texture work was done by me.\r\n\r\nTo contact me: The most obvious would be via Skyrim Nexus, but I am also on deviantART and Yahoo under the same name.\r\n",
