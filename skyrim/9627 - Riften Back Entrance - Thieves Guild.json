The only ones holding the key to the gate is the [b]Thieves Guild[/b] and there are only two known copies in existence. This back entrance is used as a stealthy means of getting in and out of [b]Riften[/b] and it is conveniently located not far from the entrance into the [b]Cistern[/b]. The gate is locked with master difficulty.\r<br />\r<br />Also added is a small path behind [b]Riften[/b], from the standard southern-western gate to the back entrance. Various trees have also been added inside the walls, looking from outside of [b]Riften[/b], for a more accurate view of what fauna is over the walls.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]How to open the gate:[/b][/size]\r<br />For this gate to be accessed you may either try your luck, and/or skill, at picking the lock (at master difficulty), or use one of the existing [b]Thieves Guild&#39;s Gate Keys[/b]. The only NPC in possession of this key is [b]Brynjolf[/b], who keeps a copy of it in his inventory.\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/9627-2-1329248936.png[/img][/center]\r<br />If you are part of the [b]Thieves Guild[/b] you may obtain the original copy of the key which lays on the [b]Guild Master&#39;s[/b] desk in the [b]Cistern[/b], [b]Ragged Flagon[/b], deep inside the [b]Thieves Guild&#39;s[/b] den.\r<br />\r<br />If you are [b]not[/b] part of the [b]Thieves Guild[/b] you may successfully pickpocket the key off of [b]Brynjolf[/b], who can be found at one of the stalls at [b]Riften&#39;s market[/b]. Alternatively, if you are brave and foolhardy, you could try making your way into the [b]Cistern[/b] and snatch it off the [b]Guild Masters&#39;[/b] table. (Might not work to sneak in when not in the Guild, haven&#39;t tested, may be so that you have to join first to be able to enter The Ragged Flagon. If it turns out it&#39;s not possible I might try to add it into this mod at a later stage.)\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/9627-2-1329248434.png[/img][/center]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Version History:[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[b]Version 1.1[/b]: Slightly alters the note referring to the key, you can now discern it&#39;s from [b]Brynjolf[/b]. Also added all trees from vanilla [b]Riften[/b] inside the walls, looking over the walls into the city now looks completely accurate. No more missing trees.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Compatibility issues:[/b][/size]\r<br />None known at this time. Though it&#39;s a fair bet it won&#39;t work with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8058]Arthmoor&#39;s Open Cities Skyrim[/url]. It should not collide with any modifications of [b]Riften[/b] though as its a really small portion of the city, only just by the old gate, which have been altered in this mod. The fauna modifications have been done to the exterior version of [b]Riften[/b] in [b]Tamriel[/b], so the trees added inside the walls will not affect any mods that change the fauna inside the city.\r<br />\r<br />Enjoy.",
