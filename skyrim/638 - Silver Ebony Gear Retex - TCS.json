  "descriptionHtml": "Edit: Sorry for changing the name twice, people. I was trying to decide what to call it. I\\'ve settled now.\r\nEdit2: I uploaded a new archive, since the old one only contained the Armor folder, and not the Weapon folder. Sorry for the screw up. I also added \\\"FIXED\\\" to the start, so people who previously downloaded the mod will see it on the main page. I will remove it soon.\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[b][color=orange]About Requests!![/color][/b]\r\n\r\nIf you are just commenting to request something, GET OUT.\r\nIf you are saying something about my mod, say what you will.\r\nThere is an entire forum section for making requests that can be found here:\r\n[color=yellow]http://www.thenexusforums.com/index.php?/forum/422-skyrim-mod-requests/[/color]\r\nFrom now on, since I\\'ve stated so in my mod description, I will be reporting ALL comments that are requests from now on.\r\nOkay? Okay.\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n\r\nHey, here\\'s another retexture pack for you.\r\n\r\nThis one retextures the Ebony armor and weapons to have a much lighter, silvery-steel look. The reason I made this retexture is because I like the Ebony armor, but I don\\'t want to always walk around looking like the black knight. The game is lacking in \\\"light\\\" armor, as well.\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]Notes[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nThis includes new textures for the Ebony Mail armor piece and the Ebony Blade weapon.\r\nNot all screenshots are uploaded. There is a texture pack that will be uploaded soon that contains the rest of the screenshots (I don\\'t want to clutter the page)\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]Install[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nTo install, extract the texture folder into:\r\nSteam > SteamApps > Common > Skyrim > Data\r\nIf you are asked to merge the folder, say yes.\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]Disable[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nTo temporarily disable any of the textures in this mod and revert back to the original \r\n\r\ntextures, navigate to:\r\n~ Weapons:\r\nSkyrim > Data > textures > weapons > (ebony or ebonyblade)\r\n~ Armor:\r\nSkyrim > Data > textures > weapons > (ebonyarmor or ebonymail) > (f or m)\r\n\r\nRename the texture for the piece you wish to revert back to the normal textures. (check the \\\"uninstall\\\" list to see what the textures need to be called to be active) If the file is no longer named properly, the \\\"texture path\\\" will be broken, and the game will return to using the textures packaged in \\\"textures.bsa\\\"\r\n\r\n[list][*]The folder \\\"f\\\" has all of the female armor, \\\"m\\\" has all of the male armor.\r\n[*]The Shield is under the \\\"weapons > ebony\\\" folder.[/list]\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]Uninstall[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nTo uninstall, navigate to the following folders:\r\nSkyrim > Data > textures > weapons > ebony\r\nSkyrim > Data > textures > weapons > ebonyblade\r\nSkyrim > Data > textures > armor > ebonyarmor\r\nSkyrim > Data > textures > armor > ebonymail\r\n\r\nIn each weapon folder, delete the following textures:\r\n\r\nweapons > ebony:\r\nebony shield_d\r\nebonyarrow\r\nebonybattleaxe\r\nebonybow\r\nebonydagger\r\nebonygreatsword\r\nebonymace\r\nebonyscabbards\r\nebonysword\r\nebonywaraxe\r\nebonywarhammer\r\n\r\nweapons > ebonyblade:\r\nebonyblade\r\n\r\narmor > ebonyarmor > f:\r\nebonyarmorbodyf\r\nebonyarmorbootsf\r\nebonyarmorglovesf\r\nebonyarmorhelmetf\r\n\r\narmor > ebonyarmor > m:\r\nebonyarmorbodym\r\nebonyarmorbootsm\r\nebonyarmorglovesm\r\nebonyarmorhelmetm\r\n\r\narmor > ebonymail > f:\r\nebonymailbodyf\r\n\r\narmor > ebonymail > m:\r\nebonymailbodym\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]Change Log[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1: Uploaded a fixed file that contains all textures.\r\nVersion 1.0: Initial Upload. Contains only the armor textures, because I forgot to add the weapon textures in. Fixed in 1.1\r\n\r\n[color=orange][b]Legal and Thanks[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nNo one may use my textures without notifying me first. If they are used in screenshots, a note must be made on the screenshot description to say where to get the textures. Why? It\\'s nice to show people where all the fancy mods on your screenshots came from.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to upload this to a site outside of skyrimnexus or skyrimforge, you MUST message me so we can sort something out.\r\n\r\nThanks to Bethesda for the great game and for the textures I edited to make this.\r\n\r\nTools used were Photoshop and 7zip",
