How about steel ingots? \r<br />Hey, are we out of smeltable dwarven scrap metal? Grand soul gems? Take a\r<br /> look.   \r<br />\r<br />If you have at least one item in the assigned container ie(Ingot in ingot chest, empty soul gem in \r<br />empty soul gem chest etc...) you will see a static version of that item \r<br />on display. If you do not want to make your house boring and empty by \r<br />losing your static display, either leave at least one of the item in the\r<br /> container, or use an UN-labeld container. There are two ordinary chests\r<br /> in alchemy/ enchanting lab, and one in the forge room.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i300.photobucket.com/albums/nn18/RuneDasRune/newtarget1_zpskshkif06.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]High Visibility Archery Targets[/b][/size]\r<br />Are you tired of shooting at ugly vanilla archery targets and not being able to see if you&#39;ve even hit it?

You can craft more at any forge.\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[size=3][b]Practice Target Toggle Switch[/b][/size]- in the backyard you can switch between dummies and standard target, and the\r<br />new swinging targets.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Long, Long Range Archery Targets[/b][/size]- Can you guess what type of character I play as in Skyrim? There is a switch on the wall by the front gate that will activate/deactivate several long range targets. They can be a bit of an eyesore so they are deactivated by default.\r<br />[img=center]http://i300.photobucket.com/albums/nn18/RuneDasRune/frontgatenight_zps0nnvlq2j.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Outdoor Lighting[/b][/size]- The porches and front gate have lanterns that turn on at 7PM and turn off at 7AM. \r<br />\r<br />[size=3][b]Hearthfire[/b][/size]\r<br />I have not added any Hearthfire content at this time so you wont be able to build kids room for adoption etc...\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i300.photobucket.com/albums/nn18/RuneDasRune/d06e40cd-4dc9-4fb6-a3c4-2fb19ecbe010_zpsmzxsautm.jpg[/img]\r<br />[heading][size=5][b]Location[/b][/size][/heading]\r<br />Follow the road going Southeast from Ivarstead.

None of the scripting would have been possible without his tutorial videos. I had no clue what scripting even was until i started watching his videos. I&#39;m serious I really didn&#39;t know what it was. If you have any interest in learning how to script watch his videos, go to his website, check out his youtube channel. There&#39;s many great tutorial videos for creation kit and scripting on YouTube, Darkfox127 was by far the most helpful for me. He shows how to do some complicated tasks in the creation kit in very time efficient easy to follow tutorials.\r<br />\r<br />If you see content that you have made or helped make and I have failed to mention you, let me know and I will update the thank you section right away.  \r<br />\r<br />[line]\r<br />\r<br />[center][color=#9900ff][size=4][b]Ideas?[/b][/size][/color][/center]\r<br />Have fun and let me know what you think. Are there features you really would like to see? Do you think some of these features are rubbish? Tell me and I will try to make this the best house in Tamriel.\r<br />\r<br />[img=center]http://i300.photobucket.com/albums/nn18/RuneDasRune/fontporchangle_zpsiyl8kgal.jpg[/img]",
