  "descriptionHtml": "\r\nMy other companion overhaul:\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12106]Unique Lydia[/url]\r\n\r\nYou have 2 .ESP to choose from (ONLY USE ONE):\r\n\r\n[b]UniqueFaendal.esp[/b] \r\n==================\r\nBasic Version:\r\n\r\n- Makes him look younger and sexier. He now have a chance with Camillia.\r\n- Level cap raised to 81, protected and gave the perk LightFoot (so he doesnt activate traps) and Ranger (walk faster with his bow drawn).\r\n\r\n[b]UniqueFaendalSpecialized.esp.[/b]\r\n==================\r\nSame as UniqueFaendal.esp with [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7245]Specialized Followers[/url] implemented.\r\n\r\n  Faendal does not cast traditional spells, but is skilled in a different form of magic. He\\'s trained to use ancient Bosmer powers that channel through his bow. Each arrow he fires carries a charge, and he can create magical arrows whenever he wills. He\\'s a skilled hunter capable of silently sneaking up on unaware animals, but this works equally well on anything else. Players who focus on stealth will greatly appreciate Faendal\\'s affinity for sneaking and ranged combat.\r\n\r\nPerk - Long\r\n- Attacks with bows cause additional non-elemental magical damage equal to 1/5 of the user\\'s destruction skill.\r\nSpell - Highland\\'s Apparition \r\n- Summons infinite arrows for 180 seconds.\r\n\r\nCHANGES LOG\r\n==================\r\nv1-1 fixed\r\nFaendal was running around naked at some point because I put his sleep outfit to none and apparently it was a no-no.\r\nv1-1\r\nRemoved the armor option. Faendal is only a peasant and should probably not be wearing an archer cuirass.\r\nTweaked his face a little. His jaw was too width.\r\nHe is no longer \\\"Disgusted\\\". His facial expression is now Neutral.\r\n\r\nMod used in screenshots:\r\n==================\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3589]Natural Eye[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2356]XCE[/url]\r\nRest is vanilla.\r\n\r\nTHANKS TO:\r\n==================\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=851501]sushisquid[/url] for his brilliant specialized follower mod.",
