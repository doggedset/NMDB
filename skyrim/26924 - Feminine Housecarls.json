  "modName": "Feminine Housecarls",
  "summary": "Small and easy mod that changes the the housecarls to use the their gender\\'s stance.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Always wondered why Bethesda chose to make the housecarls, well the female ones so man-like. I mean I understand northern female warriors were supposed to be strong (referring of what I\\'ve seen in movies about vikings), but still maybe a bit too exaggerated in their stance. From now on your favorite housecarls will use the female stance and animations, if any. \r\n\r\nSince it\\'s a simple CK modification, I\\'ve seen other mods that do the same (before you all tell me that), mine just adds compatibility with the Hearthfire housecarls, so Hearthfire is a requirement. Haven\\'t advanced in Dawnguard to see if anything needs modifying as well.\r\n\r\n[b][color=green]Affected NPCs:[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nLydia - Whiterun\\'s Housecarl\r\nJordis the Sword-Maiden - Solitude\\'s Housecarl\r\nIona - Riften\\'s Housecarl\r\nRayya - Falkreath\\'s Housecarl\r\n\r\nMjoll the Lioness\r\nJenassa\r\n\r\n[b][color=green]Requirements:[/b][/color]\r\nSkyrim with latest patch (might work on previous version, I don\\'t see why it wouldn\\'t)\r\nHeartfire DLC\r\n\r\n[b][color=green]Instructions:[/b][/color]\r\nDownload via NMM or if you prefer to do it manually, extract and copy the .esp file to your Data folder (default: \\\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\")\r\n\r\n[b][color=green]Known Issues:[/b][/color]\r\nIt might conflict with mods that change the housecarls (e.g. appearances). [b][color=red]To avoid this put my mod before UFO and any other mod that changes female housecarl attributes[/b][/color], so that any mod that comes after will overwrite this.\r\n\r\nWhat\\'s there left to say, have fun!",
