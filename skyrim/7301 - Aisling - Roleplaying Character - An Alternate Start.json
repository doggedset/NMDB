  "descriptionHtml": "Story --\r\nYour name is Aisling (pronounced ASH ling), it is what your parents named you all those years ago before they passed away to an incident in your home town of Riften. At just 7 years old with no parents, home or future ahead of you the Temple of Mara adopted you as one of their own. Teaching you about Compassion and Love, along with all the Goddess stands for. With these lessons came lessons that all Priestess\\' should receive (see Skills section below). At 21 years of age now, you decide to ask permission to leave the Temple, Maramal allows this as long as you don\\'t go back on all the values you have learnt from them.\r\n\r\nIt is Morndas, 17th of Last Seed;\r\nYou head on out for your final errand as a Priestess Of Mara, healing the old Alchemist out at Alchemist\\'s Shack, in the far western area of The Rift. It is not the first time you have been here, you regularly come here to fix the old fools\\' burns from experiments gone wrong. But as you walk to the shack, you can\\'t help but feel affection for him. He has showed you ways of healing the Temple never did, by using Potions instead of magic.\r\n\r\nTirdas, 18th of Last Seed;\r\nYou worked on the old man into the late hours of the night before, but alas you failed him. Using all your knowledge you could, he had a disease unknown to you and you couldn\\'t figure it out. After giving him a proper burial in the garden, you went to sleep, dreaming about him and all he has done for you, and how you failed him in his final moments. You wake up early in the morning, so you can return to Riften in time for dinner. You lay your robes on the bed, still in your bedwear...\r\n\r\nThis is the point where you take over Aisling.\r\n\r\n(You start with 0 gold, wearing a belted tunic and footwraps with hooded monk robes on the bed. Nothing in the shack is owned, so you can take it and sell if you wish. You also have the following spells; Bound Sword, CandleLight, Oakflesh, Flames and Healing).\r\n\r\nSkills --\r\nMagic; Alteration 20, Conjuration 20, Destruction 20, Enchanting 0, Illusion 20, Restoration 40.\r\nCombat; Archery 0, Block 0, HeavyArmor 0, OneHanded 20, Smithing 0, TwoHanded 0.\r\nStealth; Alchemy 40, LightArmor 0, Lockpicking 0, Pickpocket 0, Sneak 0, Speech 20.\r\n\r\nInstallation (If not using NMM) --\r\nExtract into your saves folder ( C:\\\\Users\\\\<Computer Account Name>\\\\Documents\\\\My Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Saves )\r\n\r\nCredits (I used these MODS and would recommend them) --\r\nBetter Females by Bella;\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812\r\n\r\nCBBE bodies;\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666\r\n\r\nCoverwomen (look 3);\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3563\r\n\r\nCoolsims hair pack;\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3809\r\n\r\nDetailed Lips;\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=689\r\n\r\nBright purple and Deep indigo eyes;\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=1763\r\n",
