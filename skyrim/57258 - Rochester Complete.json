  "descriptionHtml": "A complete new story outside the world of Tamriel, built upon the Rochester World Modder Resource. Ofcourse more places will be added than in the resource.\r<br />\r<br />In the lands of Rochester live all kinds of creatures, but you won&#39;t find many humans, they dislike humans since the humans do not live in peace with nature. Another reason why they hate humans is because some of the races living in Rochester where almost exterminated by the humans once. They where driven away and found the lands of Rochester, far away from Tamriel. Only few humans ever came into Rochester without getting mysteriously dissapearing and those decided to stay. Rochester is mostly inhabited by Dryads, Vulkasin, Khajiit, Argorian and other races living in peace with the nature (mostly beast-races).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />What I plan to do:\r<br />[list][*]Main Story\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]Alternate Start Mod: Start in Skyrim or Rochester\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]Manual NavMesh, Auto NavMesh is really bad, this takes a lot of work (NavMesh is required for any NPC (monster or human or animal) to move, this shows them where they can walk Â -- Doing This first[/*]\r<br />[*]Factions\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]Side Quests\r<br />[/*]\r<br />[*]New locations for the quests and some locations to fill up the map[/*]\r<br />[*]Custom Perk System ??
