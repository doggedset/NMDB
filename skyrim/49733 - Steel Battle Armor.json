  "summary": " This is a variation of the Steel Plate Armor that I use. It provides more protection and has a nice shine/luster to it. Great for Knights who like to get their hands dirty while still looking good. Try it out.",
  "descriptionHtml": " \r<br />Description:\r<br />\r<br /> The armor is a heavy armor set that is slightly varied from the vanilla steel plate armor. It has more protection around the waist and legs while keeping your warrior warm with some extra fur on the back. \r<br />\r<br /> It&#39;s stats are slightly higher than the vanilla steel plate and it can be crafted and tempered normally. Requires &#34;Arcane Smithing&#34; Perk.\r<br />\r<br /> Armor Pieces Include:\r<br />Cuirass (torso)\r<br />Gauntlets (bracers)\r<br />Boots \r<br />Open-faced Helmet\r<br />\r<br /> Installation:\r<br />Open rar and place files in your Skyrim data folder.
