  "descriptionHtml": "A very simple mod that makes Ingjard from Dawnguard marriageable. \r<br />\r<br />To me, I thought Ingjard was one of the better looking NPCs in the game and I was disappointed when I was not able to marry her. It is possible to use console commands to make her marriageable, but I figure some people do not know about the command or they have difficulty with it and overall it is a pain - hence the reason for this mod. \r<br />\r<br />[font=&#34;Arial Black&#34;]Ingjard&#39;s Info [/font]\r<br />Race: Nord \r<br />Gender: Female \r<br />Class: Warrior - Specializes in Heavy Armor, One-Handed, Two-Handed, Archery, and Block \r<br />Battlefield Role: Tank \r<br />Faction: Dawnguard \r<br />Morality: 3 (will not commit or support crime) \r<br />Location and/or home: Dawnguard Headquarters \r<br />\r<br />[font=&#34;Arial Black&#34;]Requirements: [/font]\r<br />Skyrim \r<br />Dawnguard \r<br />\r<br />[font=&#34;Arial Black&#34;]Known issues: [/font]\r<br />No major conflicts - will probably conflict with anything that edits Ingjard directly. \r<br />Although Ingjard is Dawnguard she will still interact as normal toward the player if he or she is a vampire, unlike the other Dawnguard members. This has NOT been fully tested, so it is possible you may come across a few issues there. \r<br />\r<br />[font=&#34;Arial Black&#34;]Future: [/font]\r<br />I will most likely not expand this mod any further. I do know that Ingjard will continually say &#34;another victory for the Dawnguard&#33;&#34; when you walk past her. After awhile this can become annoying, so I may edit or remove this line depending on how the public feels. \r<br />\r<br />[font=&#34;Arial Black&#34;]Credits: [/font]\r<br />Bethesda \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[font=&#34;Arial Black&#34;]I can take requests&#33; If you wish to see a NPC become a follower or marriageable let me know through comments or message&#33;[/font]",
