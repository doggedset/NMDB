  "descriptionHtml": "I like the way the base iron armor looks so i decided to make the mods to it that i thought made it look even better.  I darkened the armor down after i cleaned the rust up.  Removed the right shoulder armor from it along with the straps that were holding it down there.  Changed the white coloring to blue and added a cross to the remaining shoulder armor.  I did not do a helmet for this mod...it is only the chest, gloves, and boots.  \r\n\r\nThankyou redhorizen09 for telling me how to fix the issue i was having with the screen shots. \r\nFinally the good pics are up of this armor mod.",
