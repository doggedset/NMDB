  "descriptionHtml": "-update- This mod has been obsoleted; go [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14821]HERE[/url] for the latest version.\r\n\r\n===========\r\nIntroduction:\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThis is the new, improved, stand-alone version of my earliest skyrim mod, [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4269]DragonIron Armor[/url].\r\n\r\nThis armor set is made entirely from in-game assets, with a little bit of texture-editing thrown in the mix. It works for all races and sexes.\r\n\r\n============\r\nWhat it does:\r\n============\r\n\r\nThis is a stand-alone craftable armor set that can be found under \\'Iron\\' at the forge, and does not require any smithing perks to make.\r\n\r\nThe materials required for crafting this set are in line with those needed for the Banded Iron armors, and the quality of the resulting armor is slightly better than banded iron, but just below steel.\r\n\r\nVisually, the helm is exactly the same as the Dragonplate Helmet, but all the other pieces of armor have been altered to match the hue and shine of the metal parts of the helm, making them quite distinct from normal, rusty-brown iron armor.\r\n\r\nThe pieces of this armor set form a matching set for the purposes of meeting the requirements of the heavy armor perk of the same name. They can be improved as iron, using corundum, but can be improved as steel if you are using the [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1690]Legendary Smithing Upgrades[/url] mod, which I highly recommend.\r\n\r\nOther mods used for these screenshots were [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1197]HD Better Reflections for Armor and Weapons[/url] and [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=1671]Dovahkiin Dragonplate Helmet[/url].\r\n\r\n============\r\nEnhancement:\r\n============\r\n\r\nTo get the most out of this mod, you may want to consider using:\r\n\r\n* [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=44]Female Muscle Mod[/url]: For that totally bad-ass barbarian chick look!\r\n\r\n*  [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3261]Hvergelmir\\'s Armor Retexure[/url]: My mod cant currently reference this one\\'s better textures, but it CAN benefit from the superior normal maps. Install and see the difference for yourself!\r\n\r\n===============\r\nPlanned Features:\r\n===============\r\n-Planned Feature\r\n-[s]Completed Feature[/s]\r\n\r\n*Ability to upgrade this armor set using the advanced armors and dragon armor smithing perks.\r\n*Cosmetic changes that accompany each stage of armor upgrade.",
