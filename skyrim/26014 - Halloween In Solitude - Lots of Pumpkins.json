  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6][color=#FF8000][b]Check out the updated version, Halloween in Skyrim - Even More Pumpkins&#33;[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/44654]http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/44654[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][color=#FF8000][b]Halloween In Solitude - Lots of Pumpkins[/b][/color][/size] \r<br />The townsfolk of Solitude have grown a bumper crop of pumpkins, and now the streets are filled with carved, lit jack-o-lanterns.  This mod adds more than 100 pumpkins, both carved and un-carved, to the city of Solitude.  No interior locations were changed.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is strictly cosmetic.  You can&#39;t move/eat/throw the pumpkins, and I have placed them in out-of-the-way corners and on walls so that they hopefully will not be an obstruction for any of the townsfolk.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#FF8000][b]Installation Instructions[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />If you&#39;re installing this by hand, then extract all files into Skyrim&#39;s Data folder (for me, that&#39;s under C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;skyrim&#92;Data). If you already have existing meshes and textures folders, click Yes or Yes to All when it prompts you whether you want to copy the files into them.\r<br />\r<br />Once you unpack the files, verify that the mod is activated by selecting &#34;Data Files&#34; from the loader screen, and ensuring that &#34;HalloweenInSolitude.esp&#34; is checked.\r<br />\r<br />You will have to disable this mod to make the pumpkins go away after Halloween.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#FF8000][b]Credits[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />This mod was created by Deandra at the UESP (username Merilia at TESNexus since the name Deandra was taken). The pumpkins are based on a mesh and texture by Yughues aka Nobiax, which was packaged in a modder&#39;s resource by Tamira in her [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22018]New Plants 1_1[/url].  Please make sure to give credit to all of the people who have put work into these files if you choose to use them in a mod of your own, and respect their rights.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][color=#FF8000][b]Video[/b][/color][/size]\r<br />Thanks to Saiodin, Preykousis, Svaalbard and Brodual for featuring this mod in their YouTube videos&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]YtKroid2tpU[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]vDdCnkfnmDU[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]7CfUiA8FF9w[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]EoEAyG9z8D8[/youtube]",
