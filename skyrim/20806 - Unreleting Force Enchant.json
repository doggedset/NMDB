  "descriptionHtml": "I took the script for the unrelenting force shout, and turned it into an enchant. You obtain the enchant from killing a giant, and disenchanting the club. (Don\\'t worry their version has no charges).\r\n\r\nRight now it is way overpower, so I want to work on adding script so that only a very slight part of the time does it send them flying (not too far!) and less slightly staggers opponents. The rest of the time it would do normal damage. Ideally, the magnitude on the spell would control the amount of force, but that is slightly beyond me at the moment.\r\n\r\nTexture for enchant is stoneflesh, and it makes a thunder noise on hit (gets kinda annoying)\r\n\r\nRight now the force is set low, but still packs a punch.",
