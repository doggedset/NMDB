It is not targeted at experienced modders, but rather at those who have little to no experience but do know how to install mods.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Reason for this ‘tutorial’ is that I had some requests for explaining how to apply transparency to clothes or armor. And as I don’t know of any existing tutorial describing exactly that in a clear way, with the detail required for beginners, I thought I may as well share what I figured out myself and save others some work.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial will teach you how to make simple modifications to the appearance of clothes or armor, by making parts of it transparent, and thus invisible. It is not targeted at experienced modders, but rather at those who have little to no experience but do know how to install mods. \r\n\r\nThe tools that I have used are NifSkope 1.1.0-RC6 and GIMP 2.8.0. \r\nExperience with these tools is not required, as the limited use of those will be sufficiently explained.\r\n\r\nCredit -  to the creators of the mods that I use in the tutorial:\r\nDimon99 for his great female body UNP mod\r\nKURESE for his R18Pn Set - Inner Wear Set\r\n\r\nAnd RIP88 for feedback and suggestions for additional information",
