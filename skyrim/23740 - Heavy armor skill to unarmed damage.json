Really simple mod, but I felt unarmed combat was excessively under-powered and couldn\\'t find any mods that just made your unarmed damage better without adding in fake one handed weapons.\r\n\r\nOriginal Steam Workshop version can be found here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=10312\r\n\r\nI recommend just using the steam version but a user requested I add it to the nexus as well.",
