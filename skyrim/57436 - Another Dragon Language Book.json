  "summary": "Contains all the Dragon words I could find, the Alphebet, and notes on Grammar. Sources: UESP Wiki, TES Wiki (Wikia.com) and Thuum.org (canon words only). Added both books to both Alvor&#39;s & Gerdur&#39;s homes so they are available ASAP in a new play-through, or easy to find in an ongoing playthrough. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "[font=Tahoma][size=2]I like and used both the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27399/?tab=1&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D27399%26preview%3D&pUp=1]Dragon Language Book[/url] and the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10428/?]Linguists of Skyrim[/url] mods (both are also found on on [url=http://www.skyrimgems.com/]GEMS[/url]) to translate the Word Walls as I discovered them, but found the occasional word missing from one book or the other (&#34;Rot&#34; was one that was missing from both sets, which translates to &#34;Word&#34; in the Dragon Language). I got tired of popping over to the Steam in-game browser to look the missing words up, so I made this. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />============================================================\r<br />[b][size=4] THE BOOKS[/size][/b]\r<br />============================================================\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]   [b]WORDS OF THE DOV[/b]  [size=2][i](Original File, edited/updated in 1.1)[/i][/size][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/font][list][*][font=Tahoma][size=2][b]The first section[/b] has all the words I could find on the [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dragon_Language]Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages[/url], [url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Language]The Elder Scrolls Wiki[/url], and [url=http://thuum.org/index.php][/url][url=http://thuum.org/][/url][url=http://thuum.org/index.php]Thuum.org[/url] (canon words only, firstly to keep the book from being too long, and secondly to keep it as lore friendly as possible). The Linguists of Skyrim mod separates the translations to 5 books, which makes for easier spot-checking, but I found it tedious to go back and forth between books if I missed a word from earlier in the alphabet while translating. The Dragon language Book mod has everything all in one book, but puts the grammar info before the dictionary, which adds several pages to turn through while trying to get to the words. So, I put the words first in my version, since they&#39;re what I look for the most often. [/size][/font][/*]\r<br />[/list][font=Tahoma][size=2]\r<br />[/size][/font][list][*][font=Tahoma][size=2][b]The second section[/b] is the Dragon Alphabet. There are a few glyphs that look VERY similar ([font=Courier New]EI[font=Tahoma] [/font][/font]& [font=Courier New]V[/font], [font=Courier New]G[font=Tahoma] [/font][/font]& [font=Courier New]X[/font], [font=Courier New]M[font=Tahoma] [/font][/font]& [font=Courier New]UU[font=Tahoma], [/font][/font]and [font=Courier New]S[font=Tahoma] [/font][/font]& [font=Courier New]Z[/font]) so having them somewhere for reference that shows the glyphs in a much crisper way than they appear on the walls themselves is helpful. I thought it would be nice to stick the alphabet in after poking around in the creation kit and discovering in another [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragon_Language:_Myth_no_More]book[/url]*. [/size][/font][/*]\r<br />[/list][font=Tahoma][size=2]\r<br />[/size][/font][list][*][font=Tahoma][size=2][b]The third section[/b] contains some phrases, their meanings in the language of Dragons, followed by the literal translation of the Dragon words (New in 1.1). [/size][/font][/*]\r<br />[/list][font=Tahoma][size=2]\r<br />[/size][/font][list][*][font=Tahoma][size=2][b]The last section[/b] is Grammar. It explains how new words or names are formed by combining other words, and how to combine them, along with some notes on the Dovah equivalent of &#34; &#39;s &#34;. Only occasionally helpful for translating the walls, but it&#39;s neat so I added it. It&#39;s how I name any of my enchanted items now - My bow, which does burn damage and has soul trap, is Aggronzii (Ag = Burn, Gron = Bind, and Zii = Spirit). To be more accurate it should be Aggronsil (Sil = Soul) or Aghorvutsil (Horvut = Trap), but Aggronzii reminded me a little of The Doctor (Allons-y Alonso&#33;) so I used the less accurate version. I also use it to name my horses thanks to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/26704/?]Convenient Horse Herding[/url] (which, coupled with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14950/?]Convenient Horses[/url], make the horse a better follower than any of the Men or Mer I&#39;ve run into so far thanks to the smart auto-follow/horse whistle features). [/size][/font][/*]\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[font=Tahoma][size=2]\r<br />[size=3]   [b]RUNES OF THE DOV  [/b][size=2][i](Optional File, added with 1.1, fixed in 1.2) [/i][/size][/size]\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/font][list][*][font=Tahoma][size=2][b]All sections are the same as the above, except[/b] in the first section you&#39;ll see the word written in the Dragon Runes, then in Tamrielic, and finally a &#34;handwritten&#34; definition. I made each word a different font to make it a little easier to separate the Tamrielic version of the Dragon word from the definition while looking at/up words. Well, it was easier for me, and I hope it will be for anyone who downloads it, too. I put the words in this order (Dragon Runes, Tamrielic, Definition) because that was the easiest way for me to add them formatting-wise, but it also makes sense if you&#39;re trying to translate words directly from the wall. Once you familiarize yourself with each letter, that&#39;ll be easier to do than you think&#33; The formatting in this book is slightly different from Words, also, but not by much.[/size][/font][/*]\r<br />[/list][font=Tahoma][size=2]\r<br />[/size][/font][list][*][font=Tahoma][size=2][b]NOTE:[/b] The text in this book is small, because breaking each word/translation/definition into different lines or paragraphs makes the book a LOT longer, which means more and more pages to turn through to get to any words near the end of the alphabet, or which would mean breaking this one book up into several books. Not a horrible alternative since the books weigh 0, but it would mean more inventory to scroll through. If ayone would prefer several books with bigger font sizes to the one book with smaller font, please let me know.[/size][/font][/*]\r<br />[/list][font=Tahoma][size=2]\r<br />============\r<br />[size=3]   [b]LOCATIONS[/b][/size]\r<br />============\r<br />\r<br />[/size][/font][list][*][font=Tahoma][size=2]I added one copy of each to Alvor&#39;s house and to Gerdur&#39;s house, so as long as you still have your key to whichever house you had access to at the beginning of your game (or if you start a new one), you should be able to get a copy easily. Each file is standalone, so you can install just [i]Words[/i], or just [i]Runes[/i], and they&#39;ll work just fine. Both aforementioned translation mods add their books to High Hrothgar, which is more lore friendly, but I didn&#39;t want to clutter up HH by adding my books there too.

If you take a copy from Alvor, and it&#39;s stolen, and you want that fixed (and if you know what I&#39;d need to do to fix it), let me know and I will.

I tried out this mod, and I really like the way it looks, but it does make the glyphs look a little different. It felt like trying to learn a new language from one person with one handwriting style, and then switching to a new person/handwriting style before I&#39;ve fully grasped the glyphs. I&#39;ve bookmarked this mod so I can use it with a new character from the start for that reason - hopefully it&#39;ll feel like learning all over again.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2580/?]Smooth Dragon Runes[/url] by Mr Bravo - Smooths the edges on the original runes used on the Dragon Walls.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12410/?]Readable Dragon Alphabet[/url] by 175 - Makes the Dragon glyph smaller but adds a tiny Tamrielic glyph above it. \r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24716/?]Menu shouts written in dragons language[/url] by GlutSlup - An alternative to Shouts in the Dragon Tongue.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/51690/?]Dragonborn Can Read Dragon Language[/url] by qqqbbb - Obtain &#34;[url=http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Language:_Myth_no_More]Dragon Language: Myth no More[/url],&#34; and with it in your inventory, approaching a Dragon Wall will add a quest to your log, which when viewed will display the full translation.
