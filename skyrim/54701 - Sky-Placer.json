[Initial Release][/size]\r<br />[size=3]Version 1.0 Alpha[/size]\r<br />[size=5]3. [Initial Release Date][/size]\r<br />[size=3]6/7/2014[/size]\r<br />[size=5]4. [Current Version][/size]\r<br />[size=3]Version 1.0 Alpha[/size]\r<br />[size=5]5. [Current Version Release Date][/size]\r<br />[size=3]6/7/2014[/size]\r<br />   \r<br />[size=5]6. [Description][/size][size=3]\r<br />   Ever wanted to place some objects like barrels and chests and things like that into your house or anywhere you want. Well this mod is for you.\r<br />   This mod adds batch scripts for you to use with skyrim (No SKSE Scripts)\r<br />\r<br />[color=orange]I eventually wanna make a SKSE version but i&#39;m not an expert on Papyrus so it may take a while for me to do. I wanna make it like PocketEmpireBuilders System for spawning and editing but that&#39;s gonna take a while to figure out.[/color]\r<br />   \r<br />   Please note that this mod is a WORK IN PROGRESS\r<br />   \r<br />   The way I made the mod is a bit different so check the “How to use in game” Section on instructions on how to place the objects into the game.\r<br /> I suggest having the folder directory &#34;Objects&#34; open when playing the game to know the name of the batch files until you get used to it. (Its pretty simple after a while)\r<br />[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]7. [Installation][/size][size=3]\r<br />   Place the “Objects” Folder in the Sky-Placer Folder into your skyrim directory (The One with TESV.exe and SkyrimLauncher.exe in it)\r<br />   [/size]\r<br />[size=5]8. [Un-Installation][/size][size=3]\r<br />   Remove the objects folder from your skyrim directory.\r<br />   [/size]\r<br />[size=5]9. [How to use in game][/size][size=3]\r<br />   Because of the way the mod is structured you cant just use the console code &lt;bat WRDoor&gt; You have to tell the game exactly where the file is located so for example you want to place a Chest into the game Press ~ on your keyboard and type the following command \r<br />   Look at the pic Below for the command[/size]\r<br />   [center][img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/54701-1-1402203595.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />[size=5]10. [Current Objects in the mod][/size][size=3]\r<br />{Containers}\r<br />   -Barrel (No Respawn)\r<br />   -Chest (No Respawn)\r<br />   -SovBarrel (No Respawn)\r<br />\r<br />{Crafting}\r<br />   -Alchemy Lab\r<br />   -Armor Workbench\r<br />   -Wood Chopping Block\r<br />   -Arcane Enchanter\r<br />   -Forge\r<br />   -Anvil\r<br />   -Sky Forge\r<br />   -Smelter\r<br />   -Tanning Rack\r<br />   -Sharpening Wheel\r<br />   \r<br />{Doors}\r<br />   -Nordic Iron Door\r<br />   -Nordic Portcullis\r<br />   - Nordic Wood Door\r<br />   -Whiterun Door\r<br />   [/size]\r<br />   \r<br />[size=5]11. [Useful Console Commands for this mod][/size][size=3]\r<br />So this is a list of the useful console commands for this mod most will be targeted commands and some wont. \r<br />\r<br />{Instructions for Targeted commands}\r<br />Press the ~ key while in game (A console window will pop up)\r<br />Drag the cursor and click on the object you want to use the command on (Should be a reference ID on the top of the Console Window.)\r<br />Type in the command and your done\r<br />\r<br />{Targeted Commands}\r<br />GetAngle X                         GetPos X\r<br />GetAngle Y                         GetPos Y\r<br />GetAngle Z                         GetPos Z\r<br />\r<br />SetAngle X &lt;Value&gt;              SetPos X &lt;Value&gt;\r<br />SetAngle Y &lt;Value&gt;              SetPos Y &lt;Value&gt;\r<br />SetAngle Z &lt;Value&gt;              SetPos Z &lt;Value&gt;\r<br />\r<br />Disable                               Enable\r<br />SetScale &lt;Value&gt; (Default is 1.0)\r<br />RemoveAllItems\r<br />SetOwnership\r<br />MarkForDelete[/size]\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]12. [Known Issues and how to fix them][/size][size=3]\r<br />   Issue: Some Objects when you spawn them are not level to the ground. (Like Below)\r<br />   [center][img]http://static-2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/54701-4-1402199898.jpg[/img][/center]\r<br />   Solution 1: Use the GetAngle X,Y, or Z and SetAngle X, Y or Z. And see if that works. On Some objects this doesn&#39;t work either (This is apart of the game and cant be fixed as far as I know)\r<br />\r<br />Solution 2: If the above solution doesn&#39;t work then this method is a bit more tedious but what I&#39;ve found is depending on where your crosshair is on the screen the angle of the object will be different. (In Most cases if your crosshair is in the middle straight so you character is looking straight on the object will be about level enough to the ground when spawned) Sometimes you have to look up from the middle maybe down but in most cases you look up. Just keep experimenting and if the object isn&#39;t level then use the “Disable” or &#34;MarkForDelete&#34; targeted command on the object and try again.[/size]",
