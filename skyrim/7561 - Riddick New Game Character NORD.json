I\\'ve not Started on the Char, just to be done with the First Quest, And I am right outside of the Cave.\r\nThe character is named Riddick, It is a NORD, and i my Opinion Looks like Riddick.\r\n\r\nHe does not have Hair in the face, but I do Not Know how I can remove the Facial hair on his Chest, If I knew, I would\\'ve done it, I just made this to have something to do, not to make it perfect. Just a little look\\'a\\'like. Thanks. But Seriously, thanks for the Comments, I need them if I\\'m gonna make more. I need Feedback ;-)\r\n\r\n and again! Thanks for Downloading!
