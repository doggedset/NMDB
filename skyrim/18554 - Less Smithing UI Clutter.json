  "summary": "Removes items you do not have the materials for from the smithing list.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I was deeply annoyed by the fact that the items you do not have the materials for, still show up in the smithing ui. So I made this mod, that hides items you do not have the materials for.\r\n\r\nThis mod works by changing all of the forge and smelter recipes. This means there will be incompabilities with mods that change the same recipes (such as CCO). What I recommend is loading their mod last, so you will still have those changes. The changed recipes from those mods will then still show up if you do not have all the requirements.",
