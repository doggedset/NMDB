(I think they all know 8))\r\n-There is a currently INACTIVE quest to find three of the six books. You can start looking for notes that were lying on the bedroom at home in this fashion! This quest does not go beyond Blatskreach.\r\n================================\r\n\r\nThis home is located in the Blackreach of the exact location shown on screen, surrounded by walls with gates for safety.\r\n\r\nGates open levers and buttons (to open the main gate from the outside looking at the screen).\r\n\r\nBehind the walls except for the entrance to the house itself has everything you need to smith, there is also a place to relax and enjoy views of the blue ceiling of 8).\r\n\r\nThe house has three room (main hall, bedroom cabinet, and he\\'s an alchemy lab.)\r\n\r\nLog into the bedroom and the laboratory is blocked by two doors, one of the doors are opened for each room with slightly hidden buttons and inside lever.\r\n\r\nOf course this mod is not for those who collect all the books, all kinds of weapons and armor as it has only one dummy, two stands of arms and four working shelves for books.\r\n\r\nThis mod most likely targeted for those who like black limit Dwemer house and alchemy classes!\r\n\r\nPosted:\r\n1 book (raising Alchemy skill);\r\n2 diary (raising Alchemy skill).\r\n\r\nAnd who is not a loner, and travels with his companions - do not worry there are ways to mesh!",
