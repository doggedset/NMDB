  "descriptionHtml": "\r\nOPALs are also known as Object Palettes. These allow you to have organized little ‘groups’ of items. For example, one of my Palettes includes all the Dwarven Armor and Dwarven Weaponry. They make it easier to create places or people. I suggest you read this tutorial to learn more about it: http://www.creationkit.com/OPAL.  It’s easy enough to make your own, but I have created a group of 23 Palettes. These consist of Armor and Weapons.\r\n\r\nAn Overview of the Palettes in this mod:\r\n\r\n• Bandit – Armor\r\n• Blades\r\n• Companions – Armor\r\n• Daedric\r\n• Dark Brotherhood – Armor\r\n• Dragon – Scale and Plate\r\n• Draugr – Ancient Nord\r\n• Dwarven\r\n• Ebony\r\n• Elven\r\n• Falmer\r\n• Forsworn\r\n• Glass\r\n• Hide, Scale, Studded – Armor\r\n• Imperial\r\n• Iron\r\n• Leather - Armor\r\n• Orcish\r\n• Silver – Weapons\r\n• Steel \r\n• SteelPlate – Armor\r\n• StormCloak – Armor\r\n• Thieves Guild\r\n\r\nThere is no actual in-game content, this is merely to help you in creating mods! I am not asking for credit at all!!! All I would ask is that you endorse if you like it and comment!\r\n\r\nAgain make sure to look at this tutorial: http://www.creationkit.com/OPAL to know how to really use it!\r\n\r\nNew Palettes should be coming soon if people enjoy these enough. Please Endorse and [u][b]Comment![/b][/u]\r\n\r\n[u][b]Installation:[/b][/u]\r\nDrag and drop the OPAL Folder into your Skyrim Directory. This is not the Data file. It is the file just above it. (C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim <-- Drag it in here).\r\n\r\n[u][b]Uninstallation:[/b][/u]\r\nEither just don’t use the Object Palette, or go into C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\OPAL and delete my 23 Palettes.\r\n\r\nGood Modding!\r\n\r\n[size=\\\"3\\\"][color=\\\"#000080\\\"]~~BayHarman~~[/color][/size]",
