  "descriptionHtml": "[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img35/854/sanctuaryx.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img29/261/descriptionc.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n\\'Sanctuary\\' is a mod inspired by the game \\'Fable III\\', which adds a unique new gameplay feature that allows the player to travel to this player home, then back to their previous location in the world. The Sanctuary also includes a map so the player can easily change the destination they will be transported to upon leaving.\r\n\r\nTo gain access to the player home, you must open a chest in Riverwood, to the right of The Riverwood Trader ([url=http://imageshack.us/a/img29/6545/sanctuarylocation.jpg]Click this link to see the location[/url]). This chest will give you a book called \\'A Heroes\\' Sanctuary\\', which will teleport you to the Sanctuary every time you read it. Your followers will not come into the Sanctuary with you, but they should be waiting for you when you return to the world, unless you change your location. Remember, don\\'t loose the book, because you can\\'t get it back!\r\n\r\nThe Sanctuary includes:\r\n\r\n~A Map Room, with the 9 Divine Shrines and Banner customisation options.\r\n~A Living Area, with a Bed and crafting station (Alchemy, Enchanting or Smithing).\r\n~A Treasury, which displays how much gold you currently have on your character.\r\n~A dressing room with several mannequins.\r\n~An Armoury with lots of plenty of displays.\r\n~Custom Music whilst in the Sanctuary.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img834/7458/installationx.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n1) Download the main file\r\n2) Extract all 3 files from the .rar to your Skyrim>Data folder\r\n3) Make sure \\'Sanctuary.esp\\' is checked under the active files list\r\n4) Run Skyrim, Save, Quit to Desktop, then re-load as a precaution if the mod doesn\\'t appear to be working.\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can just download using the Nexus mod manager.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img844/7953/videosk.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[youtube]0Qwh68iXKZk[/youtube]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img818/9751/faqkw.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n~Loading times going into the Treasury can often be very long, due to the large amount of models in the room\r\n~Low FPS in some parts of the Sanctuary\r\n~Followers can go missing if you change your destination in the Sanctuary\r\n\r\nQ) Can I translate this?\r\nA) Please message me about it and I\\'ll likely say yes, but normally I\\'ll only let you upload it on the Nexus.\r\n\r\nQ) Can I re-upload this to another website?\r\nA) No, you may not re-upload this mod elsewhere.",
