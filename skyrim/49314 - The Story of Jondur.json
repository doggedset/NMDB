  "descriptionHtml": "Hi and thank you for checking out my mod, this book came about at 6 AM at a random moment. Suddenly i wanted to write a book in the game. I walked around Whiterun and got an idea for a story. It might not be the best epic story ever but I hope you like the story so far. You can find the book at the well in Whiterun, the well is historic, its where i got the idea. The file is simply an .esp so it shouldn&#39;t be any problem installing the mod manually.",
