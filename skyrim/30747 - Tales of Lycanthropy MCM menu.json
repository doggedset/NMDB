  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4]Description:[/size]\r\nThis mod adds an MCM menu for [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12687]Tales of Lycanthropy - Werewolf Overhaul by Brevi[/url], which provides all of the functionality of the Ancient Silver Ring.  \r\n\r\n[color=yellow][b]Version .91 is based on the v1_5 core, but [u]IS[/u] compatible with the SKSE 1.0 version, see known issues below.[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nYou must place this mod after ToL in your load order.   [b]It does not replace ToL nor does it contain any scripts from ToL.[/b]  Instead, it calls the original functions in ToL that the ring used.  This way it will remain compatible with future releases of ToL or merged with ToL itself. \r\n\r\n[size=4]Known Issues:[/size]\r\n[list]\r\n[*]When infecting yourself with lycanthropy through the menu, you will not see it take effect until you close the MCM menu and return to the game.\r\n[*]You may use this mod with the [color=lightskyblue]SKSE 1.0 standalone version of ToL[/color] and NOT install v1.5 core.   The keybinds will work properly but the [u][b]howl keybind overrides the howl menu selection.[/b][/u].  \r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[size=4]Change log[/size]\r\n.91 - Updated the download file to include the scripts.  The menu should show up properly.\r\n\r\n[size=4]Future plans:[/size]\r\nRemove the Howl Totem menu item if you are using the SKSE 1.0 version of ToL so that you only rely on the keybind to change the setting. \r\n\r\n[size=4]Credits:[/size]\r\nBethesda for this amazing game!\r\nBrevi/spwned, the author of [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12687]Tales of Lycanthropy - Werewolf Overhaul[/url]\r\n[url=http://skse.silverlock.org]SKSE[/url] and [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3863]SkyUI[/url] for adding the features that make mods like this possible",
