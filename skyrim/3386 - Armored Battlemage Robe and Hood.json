  "summary": "Battlemages rejoice! Retexture of Psiijic Robe so that appears to have armor plates underneath the robe. Also includes a chin guard head piece. This is clothing, it has no AR.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a retexture of the Psiijic robes and hood that gives the appearance of steel plate beneath the robes. Unfortunately, since this is replacing the Psiijic robe, I cannot make it \\\"armor,\\\" so it actually behaves like clothing. \r\nAlso added a jaw guard head piece/hood. Check out the screensdhots.\r\n\r\nI plan to re-implement this as an unique armor when the Construction Set is released in January. I also plan to reskin the gloves and boots to match, but this is meant to be mixed and matched with heavy/light armors.\r\n\r\n*******************************************\r\n!!WHERE TO FIND THE ROBES!!\r\n*******************************************\r\nKill a Psiijic mage (if that\\'s possible).
