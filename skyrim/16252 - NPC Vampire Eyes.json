This seems to work best when its the last in my load list, however some trial and error is required, some npcs seem to dislike been edited, and remember after okaying your changes click the actor in the object window and press CTRL+F4 to export your facial changes THEN Save.\r\n\r\nFinal version, same changes to other races eye may be a future extra files.\r\nFree to use for All!\r\n",
