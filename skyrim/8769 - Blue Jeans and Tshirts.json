  "descriptionHtml": "Blue Jeans and T-shirt mod.  V. 1.0\r\n\r\nNOTICE:  This version has been superceded by a new version.  While this version does work, there are improvements and additions with the newer version which is linked below.\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12252\r\n\r\n===================================\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n===================================\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nThis is not an immersion mod.  IF u are critical about immersion, then this mod is not for you.  It can break immersion with some players.  Also, this is a male-only mod.  There are literally hordes of female clothing mods, but very few male ones.\r\n\r\nAdd some colour to your wardrobe. This mod adds blue jeans and t-shirts to the game.  They are added to the inventory of the Radiant Raiment shop in Solitude.\r\n\r\nYou are offerred several colour choices:\r\njeans with no shirt (shirtless) for 60 septims,\r\njeans with a red t-shirt for 80 septims,\r\njeans with a baby blue t-shirt for 80 septims,\r\njeans with a dark blue t-shirt for 80 septims,\r\njeans with a white t-shirt for 80 septims,\r\njeans with a black t-shirt for 80 septims,\r\nand jeans with a black Dragonborn logo t-shirt for 100 septims.\r\n\r\nThese items offer no armour value or enchantments.\r\n\r\nThese items do respawn with the normal inventory of the Radiant Raiment shop.  So, if u happen to sell them, u can re-buy them later.\r\n\r\nWe have also included the .psd layered file used to create the textures.  It has a UV map overlay to show you where to place logos and such. You can use it if u want to add different logos or colours to the items.\r\n\r\nAfter making this mod, I realised that some of the boots in the game actually allow skin to show through them at various points.  With how we placed the dismemberment, it may show part of the jean texture also when wearing those types of boots.  I did not test every pair of boots in the game with this mod.  I also did not test every position on the weight slider with boots.  I do know the Nightingale and Thieves\\' Guild boots work well at every position on the weight slider.\r\n\r\nSome of the specularity with the t-shirts might be off too.  I\\'m not totally familiar with some of the aspects of modding Skyrim yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n============================\r\nREQUIREMENTS\r\n============================\r\n\r\nVanilla game with latest updates.\r\n\r\n\r\n============================\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n============================\r\n\r\nCopy and paste the \\\"data\\\" folder into your Skyrim install folder.  Choose \\\"yes\\\" if prompted to merge the folders.\r\n\r\nThese files should be present in your \\\"data\\\" folder:\r\nBlueJeans.esp\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\1stpersonJeans_0.nif\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\1stpersonJeans_1.nif\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansBabyBlueShirt_0\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansBabyBlueShirt_1\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansBabyBlueShirtgnd.nif\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansBlackDragonbornShirt_0.nif\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansBlackDragonbornShirt_1.nif\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansBlackShirt_0.nif\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansBlackShirt_1.nif\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansBlackShirtgnd.nif\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansDarkBlueShirt_0.nif\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansDarkBlueShirt_1.nif\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansDarkBlueShirtgnd.nif\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansDragonbornShirtgnd.nif\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\Jeansgnd.nif\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansRedShirt_0.nif\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansRedShirt_1.nif\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansRedShirtgnd.nif\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansShirtless_0.nif\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansShirtless_1.nif\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansWhiteShirt_0.nif\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansWhiteShirt_1.nif\r\nmeshes\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansWhiteShirtgnd.nif\r\nTextures\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansNormal_n.dds\r\nTextures\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansWithBabyBlueTshirt.dds\r\nTextures\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansWithBlackTshirt.dds\r\nTextures\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansWithDarkBlueTshirt.dds\r\nTextures\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansWithRedTshirt.dds\r\nTextures\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansWithTshirtBlackDragonborn.dds\r\nTextures\\\\clothes\\\\jeans\\\\JeansWithWhiteTshirt.dds\r\n\r\nWe probably will never be using the Steam Workshop for mods.  It seems to want all mods to be archived to .bsa files, and that seems like a big pot of trouble waiting to be spilled.\r\n\r\nAlso, since there are several mod managers, and this is a simple mod, we will just leave it as it is.  If your chosen mod manager can grab the zipped file and install it, then fine.\r\n\r\nTo uninstall the mod, delete the files listed above.  If you used a mod manager to install, it should do this for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n=======================\r\nCREDITS\r\n=======================\r\nNancy Krantz...modelling.  She made the actual models of the items.  And she created the textures except for the normal maps.\r\n\r\nAndrew Clements...conversions to .nif format, among other Skyrim-specific \\\"obstructions\\\" (such as that abominable weight slider crap.\r\n\r\nBethesda...the usual.\r\n\r\nSpecial mentions are deserved for some vastly intelligent people on the various forums.  Although they did not contribute to this mod, their tutorials and forum contributions certainly made my learning curve much less steep.\r\n\\\"CherryHotaling\\\"\r\n\\\"Vannus\\\"\r\n\\\"Ghogiel\\\"\r\n\\\"ThrottleKitty\\\" (a NifSkope genius)\r\n\\\"Joe Pikop\\\" (who made the \\\"somuchmorpher\\\" plugin for 3DSMax)\r\nAnd there are many others also.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
