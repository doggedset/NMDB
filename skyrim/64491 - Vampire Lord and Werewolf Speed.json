  "descriptionHtml": "Hello everyone,\r<br />\r<br />I searched high and low for a mod that did something similar but as is usual for little things like this it seems nobody has bothered before. That&#39;s why I decided to quickly make this mod and put it out there for people.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is designed to be used in conjunction with the Realistic Humanoid Movement Mod (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32229/?) but it is not necessary to use that mod. What this does is it applies the walk and run speed changes and applies them to both Werewolves and Vampire Lords in order to standardize the speeds. I&#39;ve also made it so Werewolves sprint as fast as both Vampire Lords and Horses.Â \r<br />\r<br />It always annoyed me how my character would be able to walk and run at a reasonable speed but then when I transformed my character would be slower walking and faster running which threw me off.",
