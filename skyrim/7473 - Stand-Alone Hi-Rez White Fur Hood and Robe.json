  "descriptionHtml": "[center][b]WHITE FUR HOOD AND ROBE[/B][/CENTER]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][b]>>20/02/12<< fixed texture so that the accessories on the robe displayed properly\r\ndarkened the white robe and added a darker robe --- fixed glow map issue that I messed up on with the first HotFix\r\n\r\n\r\n>>19/02/12<< color pack is now available, enjoy!\r\n\r\n>>> 17/02/12<<<\r\n\r\nFIX IS AVAILABLE\r\n\r\nIt was brought to my attention that there were gaps where the leg and arms are, CK has more equipment slots than SkyEdit apparently, and any armor built with it needs to be addressed, ie; single chest pieces that also cover arms & legs needs to use the BODY -- CALF -- FOREARM combo or those parts WILL NOT SHOW UP in the game.\r\n\r\n[/b][/CENTER]\r\n\r\n[CENTER][b]>>> 08/02/12 We added a Light Armor Variant for the females, beast race compatible ... hood is unisex [/b][/CENTER]\r\n\r\n[CENTER][b]>>> 02/02/12 W.I.P. <<<[/b][/CENTER]\r\n\r\n[center][b]small addendum to correct a statement --- the armor is female only but the hood is unisex[/b][/center]\r\n\r\n[b]Teamed up with Fouracres to bring you folks a STAND-ALONE SET with a lowered resolution @ 2048. We were able to make it craft-able at the Tanning Rack & for those who have a hard time finding one of the components, it\\'s also available for sale at Lucan\\'s Trading Post in Riverwood. \r\n\r\n***Beast Race compatible but for now it\\'s just for the females, sorry fellas, we are working hard on making a male variant suitable for download.\r\n\r\ncolor variants will be available in the near future\r\n\r\nThis is just the clothing version, we are planning a series on making this into light armor.[/b] \r\n\r\n\r\n[b]>>31/01/12<< Added new Hi-Rez Retextures of Monks Hood [variant2 brown leather] it\\'s the model I used for the hood that you get from my accoutrements mod so you should have no issues if you want to use it, also worked on the Master Robe, again this is the same model as the one I used --- These are replacements, I\\'m not a big fan of replacing anything in the game, but this I wanted to share. I spent about 8 hours learning how to manipulate textures, trust me it\\'s something that I wasn\\'t too familiar with before getting into it, so I was extra critical on myself. I finally got an end product that I am pleased with, this all started with the pursuit of a \\\"white\\\" fur hood and not being able to find one so I decided to work on one myself. This is what I came up with, I hope you like it.[/b]\r\n\r\nI re-textured the hood & robe for this mod: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6781]Nocturnal Accoutrements[/url] \r\n\r\n\r\nInstall notes -- drop the data folder into your main game folder or for the savvy you can open it up onto you desktop then check the paths yourself to see if it is going to overwrite anything you may want to keep.\r\n\r\nI would love to see some screens of your toons with this on.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i384.photobucket.com/albums/oo286/alienzerox/Skyrim%20Screens/fur%20gear/ScreenShot254-1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i384.photobucket.com/albums/oo286/alienzerox/Skyrim%20Screens/fur%20gear/ScreenShot252-1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n",
