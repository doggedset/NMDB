  "summary": "This mod aims to fix the broken endorsement button that is plaguing Nexus users.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This mod was inspired by a user who was taking a cheap shot at a Mod Creator in the post section of a new mod. This particular user hasn't endorsed a mod since before i was a nexus user, over 3 years. Being that they had time to deploy cheap shots at Mod Creator the only logical explanation is that there endorsement button does not work, Now it all makes sense as to why countless users refrain from endorsements. This conclusion was derived from the fact the attacker in particular case is an Accomplished mod author themselves. Has to be a button. Well the fix is made. Happy Endorsing fellow users. Lets made sure our Mod Authors know we appreciate their efforts.",
