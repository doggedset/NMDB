  "descriptionHtml": "   Ever thought that the vendors just didn&#39;t have enough Shoul Germs in their inventory to sell to you? Get tired of having to wait countless days to buy up some filled Grand Shoul Germs? Well now that&#39;s in the past&#33; Or future? Depending on what exactly you use your Shoul Germs for. Anyway. this mod adds an insane amount of Shoul Germs for you to buy from vendors all across the wilderness of Skyrim. No longer will you have to hunt them down in those annoying dungeons. You can just buy them&#33;...you dirty little thief you&#33; We know you have a lot of money stashed ;). Thanks for reading and downloading and I hope you enjoy this mod as much as I enjoy using it&#33;",
