  "descriptionHtml": "Version 0.7 changes (warning! cheats spoiled):\r\n\r\nI was wrong! Sorry about that.\r\nHere is attack speed mechanics in game.\r\nDefault value for WeaponSpeedMult ActorValue is 0 (!!!). But, actually, there is no difference between 0 and 1 (you can try throught console). \r\nI.e. adding 0.2, 0.4, 0.6  to player\\'s ActorValue will not give anything at all. You start to get attack speed increasing only while adding more than 1 to base value (i.e. 1.1, 1.2...).\r\nFor example, MagicEffect of DualFlurry perk checks, if you wear two onehanded weapons, and if so, adds 1.2 and 1.35 at respective perk levels to you base WeaponSpeedMult value.\r\nI think the same or near mechanics works with bows. So, adding value of 2 is equal 100% of attack speed increasing (from base which is 0 at game start).\r\nBecause of such strange mechanics (magnitude of MagicEffect used in Enchantment affects amount of added value) it\\'s seems like it is hard to draw MagicEffect description shown enchantment info (i tried automate shown effect stat, but call \\'<mag>\\' (magnitude) from MagicEffect properties sends to item info in game \\'1\\' even if actual magnitude is 1.2 or 1.6 (unable to show decimals)).\r\nDue that, changes have been applied.\r\n\r\nBy the way, i found, that base values can be damaged in your saves while using old versions of mod (!!!).\r\n\r\nHow to check (console):\r\n- Pull off all of your gear (!)\r\n- Type in to console (or copy/paste to file without any extension in you Skyrim directory, then type it in console: bat your_file_name)\r\n  player.getav weaponspeedmult\r\n  player.getav leftweaponspeedmult\r\nIf values are 0.00 - it\\'s ok. \r\n\r\nIf they are not, here the way to fix it:\r\n- Pull off all of your gear (!)\r\n  player.forceav weaponspeedmult 0\r\n  player.forceav leftweaponspeedmult 0\r\n- Save your game\r\n- Put on your gear & check your values\r\n_____\r\n- Haste now works for 1H dual weapon set also (possible bug if DualFlurry or QuickShot perk active, even if it\\'s not - PLEASE, LET ME KNOW)\r\n- Enchantment power applied on items which are available with the trader is decreased (you still can make more powerfull enchantments up to 50% for \\\"Boost Speed\\\" & up to 2.0 for \\\"Haste\\\" at maxed \\\"Enchantment\\\" skill level)\r\n  \\\"Boost Speed\\\" items - 15, 20 & 30%\r\n  \\\"Haste\\\" items - 20, 40 & 60%\r\n- \\\"Boost Speed\\\" is Boots applicable only (no clothing!)\r\n- \\\"Haste\\\" is Gauntlets applicable only (no clothing!)\r\n\r\nActual task:\r\n- How Haste should work with perks such as DualFlurry (OneHanded hive) or QuickShot (Marksman hive) (now buggy, abnormal effect report needed!)\r\n___________________________________________________________\r\nVersion 0.6 changes:\r\n\r\nWarriors! Get ready!\r\n- New Enchantment - Haste (Attack Speed increase for Bows, 2H, 1H -> righthand only!) (Daedric and Dragonscale Gauntlets added to shoplist)\r\n\r\nEnchantment works with WeaponSpeedMult ActorValue (default = 1.00) by adding 0.1 (base) - 1.0 (max lvl) to it. \r\n\r\nHaste1 - adds 20 % to attack speed (if it was not forced throught console or other mods, i.e. Weaponspeedmult ActorValue becomes 1.20)\r\nHaste2 - adds 60 %  (1.60)\r\nHaste3 - adds 100 % (2.00)\r\n\r\nPower of enchantment at item info not shown because of strange WeaponSpeedMult realisation, or... i\\'m just lacking of CK skills :) Well, going to learn!\r\n__________________________________________________________\r\nVersion 0.5:\r\nAdds a trader to BreezeHouse In Whiterun with some specific (incl. quest) items (Dragon Masks, Daedric & Dragon (only armor) Armors & Weapons (Ench. & Common)), basic and advanced materials, rare ingredients & soulgems (incl. AzuraStar & BlackStar).\r\n\r\nAll items are at standart prices, so you don\\'t need to force console or something if you don\\'t wish to break the game process too much. It would be usefull for those gamers wich are bored to get this items through already done quests, but doesn\\'t want to get it too easy. Here is a compromise - bring money & get you items ;) (at least, one command to get a lot of money is easier and more comfort than all these item-get-lists throught console - get what you really need! Need advanced equipment - earn money throught gameplay, come, buy & keep enjoying gameplay).\r\n\r\nI was so surprised that its not in game but can (if not MUST, actually) be. Here you are!\r\nAdds new enchantment (!!!) - Boost Speed (you should buy Dragonscale Boots of marathon from trader & use it as usualy - break to learn, then you can enchant with its effect. Now, you can compare movement speed with its dressed and undressed. Voila!\r\n\r\nAt this moment tested only with Russian locale ver Skyrim 1.77 patch + Dawnguard (with custom translate). But something telling me that actually must be playable in all update versions & most of mods.\r\n\r\nThere is English & Russian locales version for new enchantment.\r\nIt would be nice to know any opinions or suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere, bigger list of items:\r\n- Mace of Molag Bal, Mehrunes Blade, Sangwine Rose, Ebony Mail (Boetias quest), Thieves Guildleader armorset, Nightingales armorset, Ancient Dark Brotherhood armorset, Cicero\\'s set, Clavicus Vile mask, Spellbreaker, Hircines Rings (2), Blade of Woe, Wabbajack, Ebony Blade, Skeleton Key (unbreakable lockpick!), Azura Star & Black Star (unbreakable soulgems, many)\r\n- All ingots + dragon bones & scales, rare ingredients, common destructable soulgems (filled with Grand)\r\n- Daedric Arrows\r\n\r\nI\\'ve planned to add few enchantments like AttackSpeed, Boost Crit Damage & Crit Rate. Maybe some more - please make response! What are you intrested in?\r\n\r\nAaaaaand, please, VOTE if you like it!!!\r\n___________________________________________________________\r\n?????????? ??? ???????.\r\n?????, ????????? ? ???????? ?????, ?? ???????? ??? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?? ?????????? ?????????, ? ????? ? ????????????? ????? ???????, ??? ??????? ?? ??????????? ????????, ??????? ??????
