  "descriptionHtml": "Not sure how popular it is among other players, but I\\'ve ended up using the Savior\\'s Hide a good bit on my \\\"intended-thief-turned-amazon\\\" character. It\\'s got decent bonuses and a distinctive look, and while I\\'m also a huge fan of Rekicker\\'s \\\"Forsworn Snow Leopard\\\" armor, whenever I suit her up in it, I can\\'t help thinking \\\"Damn she must be cold...\\\"\r\n\r\nI enjoy the SH model but I thought the original fur was kinda banal, so I replaced it with this one edited from a photo of a wolf pelt. Due the manic clone stamp process, I think it ended up looking a little more like \\\"hyena\\\" but I\\'m ok with that.\r\n\r\nI will probably upload another version with a better \\\"seam\\\" up the back... was kinda hard to match the fur pattern on an unrolled model on a first pass. First mod I\\'ve ever done, so it wasn\\'t going to be perfect.\r\n\r\nIf for some reason, people are really interested, I may do some other fur patterns, but if left to my own devices, I\\'d rather work on other light armors.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you want to add it without getting it from the quest, use player.additem 0002ac61\r\n\r\nIn case you haven\\'t done it before, you\\'re going to drop the \\\"textures\\\" folder into your \\\"data\\\" folder.",
