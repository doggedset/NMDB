  "descriptionHtml": "Elven Ponytails!\r\n\r\nBow strings getting in your hair? Men making fun of your old woman hair-do? Tie that back, girl! \r\n\r\nThis replaces several of the Dark Elf hair \\\"matronly\\\" hair styles with two ponyails, a long one, and a high one, both taken from Female Humans\\' selections. This works on all Elves! Enjoy!\r\n\r\nAddendum: \r\nPictured mods include Xenius\\' excellent female skin detail mods, as well as my own \\\"Goblin Eyes Begone\\\" For Wood Elves.\r\n\r\nTo install: Drag and drop \\\"meshes\\\" folder into your Data directory, check \\\"Load Loose Files\\\" on the Data Files section of the Skyrim Launcher before launching the game, pick a Elf, enjoy.\r\n\r\nTo uninstall: Simply delete the hair.nif and .tri files from the hair directory under meshes/actors/character/.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\nAll meshes copyright Bethesda Softworks, simply moved and replaced.
