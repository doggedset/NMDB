  "summary": "this is a small simplistic player home i made for personal use but thought i may aswell share it,as the title says this is a tree house,its outdoors but accessible only by fast travel,i designed it this way to cut out an extra load door and for an epic view of whiterun,read the long description for details,",
  "descriptionHtml": "Situated to the south of whiterun,it will show up on your map automatically (this is because i wanted an accessible player home from the start of a new game).\r\nTheir is a working miniature forge,an alchemy and enchantment workbench,seperate chests for weapons and armour and smaller containers on each workbench for supplies.\r\nTheir is also a weapon plaque and mannequin and your own personal merchant with 20k gold.\r\nthe mod will be updated quite regularly and will soon have a second smaller floor,this is my first mod so any suggestions or advice are very welcome especially in regards to what i can add for future updates.",
