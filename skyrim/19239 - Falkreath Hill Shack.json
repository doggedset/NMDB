  "descriptionHtml": "[center][url=http://www.skyrimgems.com][img]http://i.imgur.com/1wXSO.png[/img][/url][/center]\r\n\r\nA small open shack on top of a hill overlooking Falkreath available to the player to live in. Starting a new play through, I decided to make a place for my character to stay in, therefore it suits my character\\'s personality and needs. The area surrounding the shack has been slightly edited with a few more trees, ferns and general aesthetic touch ups. It\\'s follower friendly with a few idle markers for them to use, and navmeshed. I wouldn\\'t really recommend more than 3 followers (If you use mods such as UFO) wandering around, because it might get cramped. First mod I ever felt like uploading; please let me know if you find anything wrong.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nBed\r\nSafe Storage\r\nBook Shelf\r\n2 Weapon Racks\r\nCooking Pot\r\nAlchemy Table\r\nWorkbench\r\nTanning Rack\r\nSharpening Stone\r\nAnvil\r\nChopping Block\r\nA couple removable torches, since the enb I use makes it really dark at night\r\nNice view of town\r\n[s]Goonzy\\'s love[/s] Feature belongs to someone else.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimply drop the .esp into your skyrim Data folder.\r\n\r\nMost likely compatible with anything that doesn\\'t modify the area in this cell. Though you shouldn\\'t have to worry too much about things spawning and killing you nearby, be aware that mods that add more spawns in the world may interfere. \r\nWARZONES NPCs (or anything similar) might feel like hanging out around your shack, and use your equipment. \r\nAlso keep in mind, there is no collision detection for rain, so if you\\'re using any rain texture replacers, might storm a little bit inside. Default rain is more believable, leaky unpatched roof and all.\r\n\r\n",
