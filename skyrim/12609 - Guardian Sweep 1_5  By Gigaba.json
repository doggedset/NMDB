  "descriptionHtml": "THE GUARDIAN SWEEP IS NOW FINISHED!\r\n__This mod creates a perk that allows you to use the much loved Sweep perk from the two-handed skill tree to one-handed while using a shield.\r\n\r\n__My goal was to make this mod (as well as Savage Cleave and Titan Bash) Without making them over-powered, so I split them up, shield users and dual wielders, each with there own places, advantages and disadvantages. It would have been easy to just make 1 one-handed Sweep mod that does everything. but that leads to extreme OP abilities that just make the game dry. so I have been slitting up melee combat into as many different ways as I can, then giving each type its own Sweeping perk each with there own buffs and debuffs to make them more practical. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n___Here is the break down for each of the perks:___\r\n\r\n-SAVAGE CLEAVE is a perk that replaces your Dual Savagery perk. It makes all of your sideways AND Standing power attacks sweep, hitting everyone in front of you. But your weapon damage is reduced by 20% while dual wielding. This is unlock-able at skill level 100.\r\n\r\n-GUARDIAN STRIKE Makes all of your Sideways Power attacks Sweep everyone in front of you and gives you a 25% damage increase, But you MUST be using a shield with your One-Handed Weapon in order to sweep. this perk replaces Paralyzing Strike in the One-Handed Skill tree and is unlock-able at skill level 70.\r\n\r\n-TITAN BASH causes your Shield Bash to hit everyone in front of you... I think that is pretty self explanatory. Replaces Disarming Bash in you Block skill tree and is unlock-able at skill level 70\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n__Download Savage Cleave here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13308\r\n(A Dual wielding sweep Perk that staggering everyone in front of you)\r\n\r\n__Download Titan Bash here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13339\r\n(Shield bash sweep that hits everyone in front of you)\r\n\r\n\r\n__future adjustments:__\r\n- making the perk visible and usable in the perk tree-----------------(COMPLETE!!)\r\n- making a separate perk for dual wield------------------------------------(COMPLETE!!)\r\n- making shield bash stagger everyone in front of you-----------------(COMPLETE!!)\r\n- More still to come!-----------------------------------------------(To be announced soon)\r\n\r\n_V1.5 Now Ready_\r\n_What\\'s new?_\r\n-Guardian Sweep is now at One-Handed level 70 instead of 100.\r\n\r\n\r\n_V1.0 Now COMPLETE_\r\nFIXED:\r\n-fully visible and functioning in the skill tree (now replaces Paralyzed Strike, don\\'t wanna lose our de-caps do we? :P)\r\n-The 2 tier perk has been merged into 1 still gives the benefit of both tiers from Beta.\r\n\r\nBugs:\r\n-none that I can see so far, please let me know if you run into any issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n-NMM works like a charm\r\n\r\nFor you manual installerers:\r\n-unzip the folder and put everything into the Skyrim Data folder.\r\n-[Computer/HP(C:)/Program Files/Steam/Steamapps/common/Skyrim/Data]\r\n-don\\'t just put the whole folder into data files after you unzip it, take the contents of the fold and drag/copy & past it into the skyrim data file.\r\n\r\nthis is my first mod btw. Send the Kudos if you like it! thanks all",
