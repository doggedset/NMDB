  "descriptionHtml": "\\\"Master Alchemy\\\" includes recipes for some of the most powerful potions in Skyrim. The book is located at the Alchemist\\'s Shack. This book also improves your alchemy skill. I\\'ve included a few screenshots, although there are a few more pages that I didnt take pictures of. The last page of potions are all of the potions in the game with 5 effects. That is the maximum number of effects per any one potion, and those potions will increase your alchemy skill the fastest.\r\n\r\nThis book does not include all possible potions, just a selection of a few of the best potions you can make. If you would like me to add more potion recipes or books, I can do that. Just let me know.\r\n\r\nAlso, I\\'m open to suggestions for improvement. Remember to endorse it if you like it. Thanks!",
