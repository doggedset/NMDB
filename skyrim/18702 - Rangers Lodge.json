They are just not for me. I like to keep my Skyrim experience as lore friendly as possible and this nice little player house will do just that! This mod will add a Rangers Lodge close to Whiterun wich can serve as the players house. \r\n\r\nThis adds a Rangers Lodge, a \\'bathing basement\\' and several fellow Rangers to accompany you in the lodge. These Rangers all have custom packages and will walk around making the place feel much more alive. They go out on patrols to keep you and your Lodge safe from any danger.\r\n\r\nOfcourse, no container in this house respawns. So you can safely store your belongings here. If you want to deinstall this mod however, don\\'t forget to take them back first!\r\n\r\nI\\'ve tried to minimize the chance of bugs as much as possible but I cant promise that this file contains none whatsoever. So use this file at your own risk. If you happen to run across a bug, please report it in the comments so I can do whatever I can to fix it!\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.majhost.com/gallery/gekkebek/Random/companions.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[size=2][b]Updates V 1.4[/b][/size]\r\nChanged lightning and ambiance of the inside area to set a better mood. (Yes, again)\r\nMade two of the Rangers followers\r\nMade one Ranger a vendor\r\nSome A.I. Tweaks\r\nMinor Cluttering changes.\r\n\r\n[size=2][b]Updates V 1.2[/b][/size]\r\nAdded more detail to the outside area, Clutter, Trees and a Tanning Rack for the Rangers to use.\r\nChanged lightning and ambiance of the inside area to set a better mood.\r\n\r\n[size=2][b]Upcoming/ideas[/b][/size]\r\nVoicing of the Rangers for a unique Skyrim experience. Perhaps addings some small quests to accompany this.\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]If you like this, a comment and endorsement would be really appreciated![/size][/b]\r\n[size=2]Additionaly, if you have any good ideas, dont be afraid to tell me about them in the comments![/size]\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.majhost.com/gallery/gekkebek/Random/bannerthing.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]This is a video showcasing an older version of the mod, version 1.2 [/size][/b]\r\n[youtube]Jev2d3u6jao[/youtube]\r\nA youtube video showcasing the mod done by the great MrTamarian!
