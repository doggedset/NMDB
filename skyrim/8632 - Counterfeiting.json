  "descriptionHtml": "Bit of a lore-friendly cheat I suppose, though not really any more so than making jewelry, in my opinion.  It adds three new crafting recipes for the forge.  One allows you to make 87 Septims from a gold ingot, for low to no profit, one that lets you make 1392 Septims from 15 iron ingots and one gold ingot (gold plated iron), and one that allows you to make 1500 Septims from 10 dwarven ingots and one gold ingot (thinner plating, heavier core metal).\r<br />\r<br />After I made this I noticed that there were a couple other mods that let you smith coins.  I decided to upload mine anyway because it approaches the issue a little differently.",
