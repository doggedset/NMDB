  "descriptionHtml": "This are some retextures for the Armored Bikini by Ortog.\r\nThey are not really lore friendly, so if you care about that, this mod is not for you.\r\n\r\nThis is not standalone.\r\nYou will need to install the Armored Bikini mod by Ortog first.\r\nFind it here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10020\r\n\r\nIt is for the UNP Body by Dimon99, so you will need to have that installed as well.\r\nIt is made for the standard UNP Body, but i think the textures will work with the skinny\r\nversion as well.\r\n\r\nMy mod contains only the texture files.\r\nIn case of the Latex Net Bikini and the Leaves Bikini, i added the mesh as well \r\nbecause of the transparency.\r\n\r\nIt is a retexture for the Bikini only, not for the other clothes included in Ortogs mod.\r\n(like Boots, Gauntlets, Stockings...)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nChose ONE of the retextures and place my files in the Armored BikiniÂ´s texture Folder.\r\nUsually it is this:  C:\\\\programs\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\textures\\\\Clothes\\\\UNP bikini\\\\\r\n\r\nIn case of the Latex Net  or Leaves Bikini, also place the meshes in the correct folder.\r\nUsually it is this: C:\\\\programs\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\\\\meshes\\\\Clothes\\\\UNP bikini\\\\\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nThank you Ortog for creating the original Armored Bikini and for allowing me to\r\nrelease this retextures.\r\n\r\nThank you Dimon99 for creating the stunningly beautiful UNP Body.",
