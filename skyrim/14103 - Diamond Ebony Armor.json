  "descriptionHtml": "READ PLEASE!\r\n\r\nMALE ONLY for a while. Busy with my Improved Fish mod, so not sure when I will finish this, also I lost my files that I was working on when my HDD died. So I dunno if I will ever feel like finishing this.\r\n\r\nSecond re-texturing I have ever done :D I wanted to make a diamond version since I got Skyrim, but I never tried re-texturing until recently. And sorry for the clipping in the pic around the neck, supposedly this happens to only mid-sized redguards. So no it is not the mod that made this, it did this to me even with the vanilla armour. :P MOST RECENT ONE FIXES THIS. Used a redguard ebony armor fix, and assigned the textures properly for it. Male armor is completely done now! :)\r\n\r\nMANUAL install instructions! Easy as pie. Just follow the the folders in the ZIP. In fact, just copy and paste them.",
