  "descriptionHtml": "I&#39;m only really uploading this for a friend of mine, but if anyone likes it feel free to use it. This is my first mod ever, and as such it&#39;s pretty lightweight. It&#39;s literally just a standard spouse made with the vanilla assets.\r<br />\r<br />His name is Flows-Like-River, and he&#39;s studying to be a dancer at the Bard&#39;s College. You can find him in the Bard&#39;s College in Solitude, usually in the first room on the right when you enter. He&#39;s a real cutie. :3\r<br />\r<br />INSTALLATION\r<br />Totally standard practice; just download the file with Mod Organizer or NMM and add it.\r<br />It&#39;s an esm, not an esp, in order to make the facegen work, but load order shouldn&#39;t make a difference; it&#39;s just a marriageable NPC. Position your other esms first; their positioning is more important than this one.",
