  "descriptionHtml": "When was the last time you visited Helgen, whatever happened to the citizens there? After the very first sighting of the dragon, the army of darkness, the draugs rode into Helgen and occupied that hold. Will you brave this quest and try to save those poor women and girls held captive by the death overlord? \r\n\r\nA small mod I made, I didnt even make it through the gate lol. So if you have a high end rig, and your player is levelled high enough then go for it. However, I have lag even running it on a duo core 3ghz. So be reminded that CTD is a probable and many deaths for your player surely. \r\nSorry, I can\\'t take screenshots off this game, dont know how to do it, if someone could kindly help out with a screenshot will be much appreciated,",
