  "descriptionHtml": "++++Still in progress++++\r\n\r\nThis version is still in early stages, I uploaded just to give an idea of what it is like, if you\\'re interesed download and let me know.\r\n\r\nThe island can be found above the lake Ilinalta, just north of Falkreath. There is an entrance portal to the island is just north of Ilinalta\\'s Deep (or if you have the flyable dragons mod you could fly there)\r\n\r\nAs I said this is still in the early stages so some things aren\\'t functional yet and there are few glitches. As far as I know there are no compatibility issues with other mods. The island isn\\'t follower friendly at the moment.\r\n\r\nCan be applied to Vanilla Game. No DLC required.\r\n\r\nLatest Update: This project is now a collaboration between myself and NordRaider.\r\n\r\nFinished Sky Palace interior and most of the other interiors, added the entrances to a few dungeons. dungeons not yet fully implemented and removed the floating arch :)\r\n\r\nStarted the quests but having a bit of trouble with it, this is my first mod for questing and there\\'s a few bugs with them. If anyone wants o help out with it let me know :)\r\n\r\nWhat is completed/functional:\r\n*Entry Island\r\n*Main Island\r\n*Town Exterior (buildings/clutter/Some interiors)\r\n*Sky Palace\r\n*Sky Forge\r\n*Cave with enemy\r\n*Basic Quest (buggy: most of the time it can\\'t be started)\r\n\r\nTo Come:\r\n*More Interiors\r\n*More NPCs: Guards/Townsfolk/Merchants\r\n*Dungeon\r\n*Quest-line\r\n*More in-depth lore\r\n\r\nAny doors that require a key are to room s that are not created, leave them be for now.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you are interesting in collaborating for any of the above future updates. If anybody wants to use the new land in their mods they are free to do so but please ask me first (I would like to know) and you can credit me too :)\r\n\r\n",
