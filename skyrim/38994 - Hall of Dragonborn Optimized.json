The game engine was rendering most of the stuff inside on certain spots so that caused FPS drops.\r<br />\r<br />My system is a Core i7 3.8Ghz, 120GB SSD, ATI 7850 2GB@1200/5800 clocks\r<br />I run with ENB with RealVision profile and can keep 50-60 FPS at all times in all Skyrim, except this house WAS a FPS killer.[/SIZE]\r<br />[/COLOR]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[SIZE=3]ENB[/SIZE]\r<br />[COLOR=#4F81BD]\r<br />If you want the exact same lighting level/shadows that are in the screens, using RealVision, change the intensity in enbseries.ini to\r<br />\r<br />AmbientLightingIntensityInteriorDay=0.25\r<br />AmbientLightingIntensityInteriorNight=0.25\r<br />[/COLOR]\r<br />\r<br />[SIZE=3]Installation[/SIZE]\r<br />[COLOR=#4F81BD]\r<br />Obviously this mod overwrite the original so you must take out all items from the old house mod and do a clean saving. \r<br />\r<br />Save your game, then exit Skyrim and disable the old .esp, load your game, create a new savegame, exit Skyrim, then you can copy the archive content and overwite all files from this mod and load your newly cleaned savegame.\r<br />[/COLOR]\r<br />\r<br />[SIZE=6]Credits[/SIZE]\r<br />[COLOR=#4F81BD]\r<br />[SIZE=3]Halordy and all mod authors resource materials on original mod page, Thanks&#33;[/SIZE][/COLOR]",
