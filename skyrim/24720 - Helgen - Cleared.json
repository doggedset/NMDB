  "descriptionHtml": "[size=4][b][color=red][center]WARNING!!!  LOADING THIS MOD AND STARTING A NEW GAME WILL BREAK THE MAIN QUEST, AND POSSIBLY MORE!!!  DON\\'T DO IT!!![/center][/color][/b][/size]\r\n[size=4][b][color=red][center]WARNING!!!  DO NOT USE A SAVE GAME YOU CARE ABOUT!!!  THIS MOD REMOVES A LOT OF DEFAULT BETHESDA STUFF IN HELGEN AND HAS A CHANCE OF SCREWING UP A SAVED GAME!!![/center][/color][/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[u][b]RECOMMENDED USE[/b][/u]\r\nThis mod was designed to be used with the [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22330]Tundra Defense[/url] mod by Elderwind.  It is highly recommend that you only use this mod for the purpose it was intended.\r\n\r\n[u][b]DESCRIPTION[/b][/u]\r\nThis simple mod basically clears all the damaged buildings, fires, rubble (some remain for effect), bandit spawn locations and everything to do with the Starting Quest.  The towers, walls and main Helgen Keep have all been preserved to be used as you see fit.\r\n\r\nI have nav meshed the entire area.  The main road leading through Helgen is set as preferred, walls have nav meshes on their tops, the two main gate entrances have been nav meshed as well.\r\n\r\n[u][b]COMPATIBILITY[/B][/u]\r\nWill not work with any mod that modifies Helgen in anyway.\r\n\r\n[u][b]KNOWN/REPORTED ISSUES[/b][/u]\r\n- Will not work with a new game, it is suggested this mod be loaded [color=red]AFTER[/color] a new game has begun and the main quest has been started.  Simply save after you start the main quest (a good time for this is when you exit the Helgen dungeon), quit game, load mod, restart game.\r\n- Minor follower pathing issues...followers take very odd routes sometimes to keep up with your character.  I have nav meshed and re-nav meshed, yet followers still choose odd pathing routes at times.\r\n- Sometimes there seems to be double gates when entering Helgen after this mod is installed.  Exiting and reloading the game seems to fix the issue however.\r\n- Installing this mod, going to Helgen, then uninstalling this mod breaks Helgen.\r\n\r\n[u][b]VERSION HISTORY[/b][/u]\r\nv1 - Original Version\r\nv1.1 - NG Edition (removes main gates)\r\n\r\n[u][b]INSTALL/UNINSTALL[/u][/b]\r\nAlways use NMM!!!\r\n\r\n[b][u]PERMISSIONS[/u][/b]\r\nThis mod may not be uploaded to any site or used in any way without prior consent from it\\'s creator, Diamok.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Credits[/u][/b]\r\nElderwind - For his fantastic [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22330]Tundra Defense[/url] mod.\r\nSkyrim Nexus and all [url=http://www.nexusmods.com]Nexusmods.com[/url] sites - For being kick ass!!!\r\nBethesda - For the Elder Scrolls series of games.\r\n\r\n[b][u]My Mods[/u][/b]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/16816]The Scribes Lecturn[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/18872]Target Training System - TTS[/url]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24720]Helgen - Cleared[/url]",
