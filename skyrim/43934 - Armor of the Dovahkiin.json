  "descriptionHtml": "Ever wanted to look like the dovahkiin from the trailers? Nows your chance! Armor of the Dovahkiin adds a new weapon and armor set to your skyrim game.\r\n\r\nThe armor and weapons ratings are close to glass, so they are very powerful. They can be upgraded at a workbench/grindstone with their normal items.\r\n\r\nThe mod includes:\r\nCuirass of the Dovahkiin - Studded Armor with enchant\r\nHelm of the Dovahkiin - The iconic Iron Helmet with enchant\r\nBoots of the Dovahkiin - Iron Boots with enchant\r\nGauntlets of the Dovahkiin - Iron Gauntlets with enchant\r\nShield of the Dovahkiin - Banded Iron Shield with enchant\r\nSword of the Dovahkiin - Steel Sword with enchant\r\n\r\nUPDATED INFO: For version 1.1L and 1.1H, I have updated many things. The armor is now much more powerful, and has stats higher than daedric. However, the armor is now located in a chest at the Throat of the World. There is also a chest there that has arrows for the bow, and the chest respawns so you can visit the Throat of the World to get more arrows. I would have used a vendor in this case, but I couldn\\'t get him to work :( Another update I have made is to the armors info. Now, there is a heavy variant of the armor and a light variant, which is what the L and H in the mod versions name stand for. Leave me comments about this updates or updates you would like to see in the future :)\r\n\r\nI made this mod just so that you can look like the Dragonborn from the trailers. \r\n\r\n\\\"Wow those textures are awesome!!! Where can I download them????\\\"\r\nThe textures I am using are from the aMidianBorn series by CaBaL120 (If you haven\\\\\\'t heard of him, you have issues). Unfortunatley, the files cannot be individually downloaded, BUT you can download his AMAZING compilation of all his retextures called \\\"aMidianBorn Book of Silence\\\" right here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/24909/?\r\nTrust me, you WILL NOT regret downloading it. CaBaL is awesome.\r\n\r\nPLEASE LEAVE FEEDBACK!!!! If you think the armor is too OP, let me know and I can make a less OP version for you. \r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUPDATES\r\n1.1L and 1.1H - Added light and heavy variant, stat changes, enchant changes, new chest. \r\n\r\n1.1 - Fixed cuirass, now correct armor\r\n\r\n1.0 - Initial release\r\n",
