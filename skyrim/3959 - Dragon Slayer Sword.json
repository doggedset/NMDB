This weapon takes the place of the Daedric Greatsword by default but can replace any two handed sword as long as it is named correctly and placed in the correct folder.  To install the weapon Place the textures and meshes folder in:\r\n\r\nC\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\commom\\\\skyrim\\\\Data\r\n\r\nto uninstall simply remove the textures and meshes folders your Data folder and the default textures and meshes will be loaded.\r\n\r\nFeel free to edit the file for personal use but please don\\'t edit and repost without asking me first... thank you.",
