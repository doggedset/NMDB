  "descriptionHtml": "Better Dark Brotherhood Mage Clothes\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\nThis is my extremely simple change to the fairly crappy mage clothes Dark Brotherhood initiates are able to pickup on their first visit to the Sanctuary.\r\n\r\nAlterations:\r\nRobe - 15% damage boost to Destruction spells + 100% boost to Magicka Regen\r\nHandwraps - 20% bonus to Sneaking\r\nBoots - no change (muffle)\r\nHood - +40 Magicka\r\n\r\nThese changes aren\\'t meant to be game-breaking, just to make the clothes worth using.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nUse NMM for total easiness.\r\n\r\nManual Installation:\r\nOpen the archive and drop the .esp into your Data directory.\r\n\r\nTo un-install, either use NMM or just delete the .esp\r\n\r\nThis is my first released mod. It\\'s as simple as they come and I don\\'t really intend to do much more with it. I can\\'t imagine it\\'ll throw up any incompatibilities but please let me know if something weird happens.",
