  "descriptionHtml": "This is a mod that increases all alchemy items in all apothecary\\'s.\r\n\r\nFor instance, ever go into an apothecary only to be disappointed by them only have 3 bits of a common flower you want to make potions with, but notice that outside there are 50 different flowers that suggest they should have more?\r\n\r\nThis is a fix for that. It makes all apothecary\\'s carry more of everything for your potion making needs. Or even if you aren\\'t an alchemist, this gives most apothecary\\'s more potions to sell.\r\n\r\nTake note, that it\\'s still going to give one item per each time the apothecary uses a leveled list, so you might see 30 small antlers, and then 15 salt, and 7 nightshade, and the rest a few 1-3s. The reason for this is that the number of items it gives is based on a random roll for a single item in a list of about 30 items. So it will only give about 3-4 items in counts of 15+ this was not intended, but I feel like it provides some amount of balance, and makes it so you still have to go harvesting plants every once in awhile in order to get some things.",
