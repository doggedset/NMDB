  "descriptionHtml": "This mod is Skyrim version of alchemy cave found in All-in-One Basement mod for Oblivion. Only ingredient jars and textures (though renewed) created by Dark Jester are being used. Sorting script and cave design is my doing.\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion: 0.8 - working as intended except for a little quest bug\r\nLast release: 7/15/2012\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n===========================\r\n\r\n• Quest to get access to the cave\r\n• The Cave - Alchemy bench, Ingredient Jars, command console (see readme), bedroom, storeroom (all containers in the cave are non respawning, so is the entire cave) and cooking stands.\r\n• Ingredient jars are sorted alphabetically by their original English names in Skyrim\r\n\r\nINSTALATION\r\n===========================\r\nExport archive to Skyrim\\\\Data folder\r\n\r\nBUGS\r\n===========================\r\n• the quest is supposed be started by courier but when the courier meets you he will say he has a note for you but doesn\\'t give it to you. Just travel to another habitable cell  (ideally different city) and the courier approaches you again, gives you a note and the quest starts.\r\n\r\n• there are few texts I wrote - couriers note, some book about the cave etc but it might be grammatically incorrect \\'cos English is not my native language.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo do / Future plans\r\n===========================\r\n• make cave more natural - more clutter and better lighting, hence the version 0.8\r\n• new potions, Dawnguard ingredients jars, add a garden of some sort etc\r\n\r\n\r\nHope you\\'ll enjoy it\r\nUmpire\r\n\r\n\r\n",
