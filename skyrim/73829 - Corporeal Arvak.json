  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=6]CORPOREAL ARVAK\r<br />[/size][size=3]\r<br />This mod is designed for those who love horses, retexturing Arvak so that he is a very light dapple grey with eyes that shine either blue or red.\r<br />\r<br />This particular coat colour appears to glow as well as the eyes, especially in full sunlight (at least on the lower settings that I play on) meaning that Arvak retains a supernatural appearance while also being beautiful & comfortable to ride bareback.\r<br />\r<br />No other changes have been made & Arvak should remain exactly the same in all ways other than his appearance.  Please let me know if he is not behaving as he should&#33;\r<br />\r<br />This mod has been difficult for me to properly test as I do not have Arvak yet, I do not recommend using it at this early stage of it being uploaded unless you already have him, make a backup save, & can quickly identify whether the mod does what it is supposed to do without any unintended surprises (I don&#39;t foresee any problems, & I would really appreciate you reporting your findings either in the posts or via pm).\r<br />\r<br />There are now also some &#34;Restored&#34; options - the intention of these downloads is for Arvak to initially have his vanilla bone form & be restored to his former corporeal beauty when you complete the quest & are able to summon him.  Please consider these two options experimental for now as I am unable to actually test them in my own game yet - a huge thanks to anyone in the position to do so who also spares the time to post whether or not they are working as planned&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Requires Dawnguard.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=5]CREDITS\r<br />[/size][size=3]\r<br />Slof for the horse textures used.\r<br />Nakoichi (Shadowmere Blue Eyes & Glow) for the blue eyed horse mesh.\r<br />Alek (Convenient Horses) for the red eyed horse mesh.[/size][/center]",
