  "descriptionHtml": "This mod requires Dragonborn and the latest update!! It will not function properly (probably not at all) without them. That being said...\r\n\r\nThis mod makes the gray quarter into, in my opinion, a far better home for the Dunmer of Windhelm. It is still a slum, I took that into account. Its just that I felt that it lacked that certain cultural flair that it needed. Dragonborn gave me the oppurtunity to give it just that. It also adds a very small player \\'house\\'. It is hidden but there is a chest safe to store your items in and a bed to sleep in.\r\n\r\nI have tried to keep the objects and lighting that I added to a minimum to keep the mod from bogging down slow computers. I know that with it on I don\\'t even lose one fps (But I am running on a very expensive build.) Also I made this mod mostly for me but with thought put into it for others. As such I have added a few features that I probably will not use (like the small player \\'house\\').\r\n\r\nAs for compatibility. The mod itself only alters the gray quarter. The rest of Windhelm is left untouched. However I do not use very many mods that alter Windhelm. I know that it is compatible with the mod \\'Pit Fighters\\' the only issue is that an urn is sticking half way out of the wall, very minor. Also it is completely compatible with interior lighting mods as I did not edit any interior except for the New Gnisis Cornerclub. The lighting mod I use still functions properly with the addition of two light sources I added. Other than that... You\\'ll have to back your own judgement for now.\r\n\r\nBut if there is any interest I may do the other interiors aswell. I personally do not venture inside many of the buildings inside the Gray Quarter and thus left them untouched. \r\n\r\nAnd finally, I hope that all of you who download it run into no issues. If you do, tell me, and I\\'ll see if there is anything I can do. (Although I only editted the appearance so there shouldn\\'t really be any major issues. But you never know with these mods.) \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n\r\n1.0 - Initial Release\r\n1.1 - Per request added Dunmeri drinks to the Gray Quarter. Mostly the New Gnisis Cornerclub.",
