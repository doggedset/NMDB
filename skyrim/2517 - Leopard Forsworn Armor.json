  "descriptionHtml": "Leopard Forsworn Armor\r\nby XunAmarox\r\nVersion: 2.0\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nThis is a retexture of Rekicker\\'s wonderful [url=http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=263]Snow Leopard Forsworn Armor[/url].\r\n\r\nI completely redid most of it. My version 1 was just recolored, but... I felt it was a little subpar for a normal leopard coloration, so I redid the whole thing with a better leopard texture. I colored the furry stuff hanging off like leopard down fur too (like bridge between sides & white on tummy).\r\n\r\nI also removed the bra strap in favor of a little something that just goes up a ways and covers the nipple.\r\n\r\nAnyways, hope you like it. It\\'s been circulating around for awhile, but I felt I should probably actually package and upload it for better distribution and easier to find.\r\n\r\nPackage:\r\nDefault: no-undies\r\nIncluded: no-top\r\nPanties not included.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n1. Paste contents /Data/ into /Data/.\r\n2. If you want the alternative versions, replace files afterwords with those.\r\n3. Enjoy~\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nRekicker for their Snow Leopard Armor (the entire base and idea, really)\r\nScorpionHunter for their [url=http://skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=742]edit of the gloves/boots[/url] (which I\\'m not sure I even used? But... may as well credit, all the same!)",
