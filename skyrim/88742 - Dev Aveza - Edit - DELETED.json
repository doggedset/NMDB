  "summary": "As I play with this mod on, I realized how important the beacon is...<br />so I gave the Captain a beacon, when you kill her you can get it from her corpse.<br /><br />I also made the beacon a lot easier to make.<br />I removed the Dwemer Smithing requirement because as a mage, I don't want to waste a perk.",
  "descriptionHtml": "You don't want to drive this Airship without a beacon, otherwise when you go out of bounds, you have to say goodbye to that neat airship you stole from the Thalmor.\n<br />That's why I edited it.\n<br />\n<br />Credits to Deapri, the one who made the mod.",
