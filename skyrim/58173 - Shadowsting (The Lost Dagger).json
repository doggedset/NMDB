  "descriptionHtml": "Once wielded by a great adventurer, this mighty dagger is now lost, in the ruins of the adventurer&#39;s demise. Find his remains, and you can claim this dagger as your own&#33;\r<br />The dagger itself has a unique enchantment (you have to find out what it is for yourself), and can be tempered, but not crafted or un-enchanted, making it truly unique. It can be found in the ruins of a great maze, where an unfortunate adventurer met his end.\r<br />\r<br />About the dagger: This is the third weapon I have 3D modelled and textured from scratch. I believe it is an improvement on my last two. For it I made both a normal map and an environment map - the latter I had never done. It&#39;s also the first weapon I&#39;ve made that has blood effects for it (so when you hit people it will actually get bloody&#33;). I spent quite a long time on this so I hope you guys like it :)\r<br />\r<br />Installation: Choose the version you want (either the one with the gem in the hilt or the one without it), then just install normally via NMM, or extract the esp to your data folder, and merge the meshes and textures folders with the ones in your data folder.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility: There should be no problems with other mods that I know of.\r<br />\r<br />Have fun&#33; :)",
