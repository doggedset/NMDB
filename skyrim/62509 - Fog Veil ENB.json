  "descriptionHtml": "Ever notice how bad the distant details in skyrim look? Of course you have. Sure, there&#39;s mods to aid it, but mainly they only change the textures, and some can slow you game immensely. Here&#39;s a solution: cover it up instead&#33;\r<br />[img]http://s17.postimg.org/p5n09a4zj/Screen_Shot5.png[/img]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=6][b]For best effect, go to Throat of the World.[/b][/size]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />This ENB uses a feature called ENB Mist, which is basically a completely revamped fog system for the game. I have been tweaking the parameters for it for 3-4 months, and I believe that I have found the preset that I feel is completed (that doesn&#39;t mean there won&#39;t be possible updates). I find that the mist does an excellent job in covering up the arguably bad looking distant LODs and textures that the game has, while providing a very realistic environment. Especially compared to the grey sheet of whatever that Bethesda called fog...\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />The ENB itself is nothing too special; it is a simple, cleaner variant of the vanilla game, the portion I spent the most time on was the fog. (But that doesn&#39;t mean I didn&#39;t spend time on it&#33; It has HBAO ambient occlusion, bokeh DOF, godrays, ENB sharpening, reworked environmental rendering, and all that jazz.)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />And, the crowning jewel of the fog is the changes it brings to nighttime. I found this effect worked great for screenshots at first, but my main goal was to make It as playable as possible. It is not disorientationaly bright, but it is subtle, noticeable, and (in my opinion) looks pretty damn good. And, c&#39;mon, they&#39;re nights, they should be dark&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]prkQ1YQkdiI[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]7RNKRFP4MV8[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://s29.postimg.org/bq7425e1z/fog_3.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />It&#39;s more of a background effect really, as light from fires and torches and such fills the area with color([b][u]huge[/u][/b] inspiration from Noir ENB-Fogbound)\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve tested this preset extensively, and probably wasted more time tweaking it than actually playing it, but the end result is perfectly usable in battles and just playing normally. But, if your still not sure, just try it yourself&#33; If you don&#39;t like it, fair enough, and maybe you could tell me something about it you want changed.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />But if you reeeeeeeaaaaaaaalllllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyy can&#39;t stand the concept of a darker night, there IS a vanilla nights version...But I don&#39;t really recommend it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][u][b]Required Mods\r<br />\r<br />[/b][/u][/size]For dark nights, you need the realistic nights mod, and you need to pick the darkest option: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49472/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49472/?\r<br />\r<br />[/url]Mindflux particle patch (fixes bright water at night): [url=http://enbseries.enbdev.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1499]http://enbseries.enbdev.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1499[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Also need ENB v .250+\r<br />\r<br />[size=5][b][u]Recommended Mods\r<br />\r<br />[/u][/b][/size]Wearable Lanterns : [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17416/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17416/?[/url]\r<br />Hassle-Free Night Light&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=5]Credits\r<br />[/size]\r<br />[size=2]Boris Vorontsov - ENB\r<br />\r<br />[/size]ZeroKing - Post Process Addon : [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50638/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50638/?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />Rusey - Noir Enb Fogbound (for the inspiration...and the fog placements) : [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60935/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60935/?[/url]",
