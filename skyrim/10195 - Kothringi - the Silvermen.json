  "descriptionHtml": "A race of men mentioned in only a few in-game books hailing from Black Marsh. They were said to look like men only with metallic skin and were quite common in Black Marsh during the Second Era. They were eventually wiped out by the Thrassian Plague before the start of the Third Era.\r\nTheir origin is unknown. Some say they are the result of Nedes and Argonians interbreeding, others say that they were simply Nedic settlers that adapted to life in Black Marsh.\r\n\r\nKothringi are a little bit shorter than other races, and most of them have a leaner build, but they are also faster than average. They can make up good Blacksmiths, Alchemists, or Thieves. (10+ Smithing Bonus, 5+ Sneak, Lockpicking, Speech, Alchemy and Enchanting Bonus).\r\n\r\nSkin textures based on Thepal/Xenius textures.\r\nThanks to Bethesda and their great Creation Kit.",
