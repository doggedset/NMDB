  "descriptionHtml": "A dragon companion that you will find somewhere near Whiterun where she crash lands after escaping.\r\n\r\nAfter being injured from fighting her way free from Alduins grasp and no longer able to fly she will provide ground support with a variety of different shouts including Ice Form and Marked for Death.\r\n\r\n\r\nA work in progress and my first mod so i may end up working in custom textures to make her truly unique when i get more experience in creation kit and finish with them, i will also be working on a quest line for her and maybe just for laughs marriage? Though it\\'d be tricky getting her in the temple enough for the marriage to get started without making her any smaller\r\n\r\nShe is smaller than other dragons in the game being a female of the species, she is also essential  and will level with you \r\nLikes to use ice form alot on smaller enemies like bandits and animals paralyzing them for a few seconds \r\n\r\nI also increased her speed to 130 so she can keep up with you plus i think it suits her, may increase further in the future\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any suggestions as to improvements or changes that you think would make this better by all means let me know ill see what i can do, i will make sure suggestions get due credit if i use them\r\n\r\nALSO FEEL FREE TO TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------> UPDATES \r\nworking on follower scripts\r\n\r\n- 0.2a - added some scripts and abilities including call animals may need a bit of testing to get it to work the way i want it to\r\n\r\n- 0.1b - added 2 larger sizes .8 and .9 scaled up from original .72\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------> Will provide updates as soon as i can\r\nFORGOT SHE HEALS HERSELF SOMETIMES WHEN SHE GETS LOW ON HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\n------>Recommendations\r\n-Ultimate follower overhaul - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14037\r\n-Dragon combat overhaul - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32597/\r\n-Come together n out of the way - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33562/\r\n\r\n\r\n-----> FUTURE PROJECTS\r\n- A dragon city and dragons that thrive underground out of sight, mostly non-hostile, maybe ill make it an environment like Blackreach but a bit bigger and have a few settlements dotting the landscape with dragon npcs roaming around and a quest leading off of Lizdiinlaas after you finish her questline for an actual story-ish area\r\n\r\n- maybe baby dragons? along with other ages\r\n\r\n- need to figure out\r\n           - how to put in situational followers and merchant dragons\r\n           - how to make actual arm textures and meshes instead of wings for some of the dragons underground \r\n                    ^(gonna need help with this one)^\r\n            - a way to call her without her getting stuck on stuff \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---->Requirements - subject to change\r\n the only thing that should be required for now is the latest update.esm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---> Install\r\ndownload and install with nmm or take the esp and drop into the data folder\r\n\r\n\r\n-------> Uninstall\r\npart ways and then save quit game and delete or deactivate esp\r\nfor nmm just remove her as a follower and deactivate mod\r\n\r\n-----> Known errors so far\r\n\r\n-she gets stuck on the environment but will teleport to you after a little bit\r\n\r\n-you may get stuck under her when she follows you into towns and such i find using a shout like unrelenting force  or whirlwind sprint seems to do the trick, working on a way to solve this because i use her as well and its kinda annoying\r\n\r\n-gets messed up in tight areas with limbs getting misplaced, haven\\'t seen a way to solve this yet\r\n\r\n-anything else that i may have forgot to include about a grounded dragon follower :p \r\n\r\n\r\n-------------> Credits to.......\r\n\r\nAnyone willing to help me better this mod \r\n\r\nBethesda for making this damn fine (if not glitchy as hell) game",
