  "descriptionHtml": "\r<br />This mod expands on the idea of dwemer ingenuity. Recently excavated site contains mills allowing for powdering and refinement of ores into powders, fine enough to use in alchemy. Workshop contains a bronze head , capable of dictating research journals to anyone with time (and some paper and ink) on their hands. \r<br />\r<br />The greatest prize of this lab is an everburning charred substance, result of alchemical research into creation of the world powering whole complex, and gathering aethyric energies over time and crystalising soul gems in a small chamber.\r<br />Currently this process is barely understood and visiting scholars can sometimes gather randomlyÂ  developed soul gems.\r<br />\r<br />There is a &#34;to do&#34; list:\r<br />-main workstation\r<br />-crafted journals\r<br />-breadcrumbs leading to the site\r<br />-possibly a quest",
