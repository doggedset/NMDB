  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://static1.nexusmods.com/110/mods/110/images/16020-1-1336233681.png[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a Spiderman costume (as well as a Symbiote Costume!) to a 'Cobwebbed Closet' on the upper floor of the Radiant Raiment in Solitude. (For those of us counting, that's 32 new meshes and 27 new textures.) :D\r\nCurrently the costume adds no special bonuses and is just for decoration. (It's obviously not lore friendly).\r\nI made this mod because I love Spiderman and Skyrim, and because it gave me an excuse to learn blender to Skyrim nif conversion. I hope you like it!\r\nPs. Be sure to check out my other mods by clicking [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/modules/members/index.php?id=1398716]here[/url] and clicking on the files tab. :D\r\n\r\nSee Spidy in action! (Thanks Angstyferrets!)\r\n[youtube]EpwTrNbvnRs[/youtube]\r\n\r\nOur, check out Muzzammil12's showcase of the updated Symbiote costume, along with a web shooting mod!\r\n[youtube]o7-hDQ-m6eY[/youtube]\r\n\r\n[img]http://z13.invisionfree.com/IceburgsSkyrim/index.php?act=Attach&type=post&id=22002745[/img]\r\n\r\nMerge the 'Data' folder with the 'Data' folder in your Skyrim folder.  Don't forget to check the esp \"AK- Iceburgs Spiderman Suit\".\r\nIt's just that simple!\r\n\r\n[img]http://z13.invisionfree.com/IceburgsSkyrim/index.php?act=Attach&type=post&id=22002750[/img]\r\n\r\nTo uninstall, remove these two folders:\r\nData\\textures\\armor\\AK Spidersuit\r\nAnd Data\\meshes\\armor\\AK Spidersuit\r\n\r\n[img]http://z13.invisionfree.com/IceburgsSkyrim/index.php?act=Attach&type=post&id=22002744[/img]\r\n\r\nThis mod took way more time to make than I expected it would! To see what I mean, check out some of the [url= http://z13.invisionfree.com/IceburgsSkyrim/index.php?showtopic=4] WIP pictures![/url] *Updated\r\n\r\nVersion 2:\r\nVersion 2 includes 2 changes. First, I've updated the normal maps of the body and hands so that they are as dark as the other parts of the costume. Second, by using AdPipino's [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=12801]Optimizer Textures,[/url] the unzipped file size has been reduced from 80mb to 18mb, (without perceptible loss of quality).\r\n\r\nVersion 3:\r\nVersion 3 adds a mesh like texture for the blue parts of the Spiderman costume (as per FrankFamily's suggestion), as well as an all new Symbiote Suit! \r\n[img]http://static1.nexusmods.com/110/mods/110/images/16020-1-1341852116.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://z13.invisionfree.com/IceburgsSkyrim/index.php?act=Attach&type=post&id=22002743[/img]\r\n1) Fix issues listed in Bugs section\r\n2) Powers to accompany the suit (in progress)\r\n3) POSSIBLY a Venom suit\r\n\r\n[url=http://z13.invisionfree.com/IceburgsSkyrim/index.php?showtopic=7]View news about progress on future features.[/url]\r\n\r\n[img]http://z13.invisionfree.com/IceburgsSkyrim/index.php?act=Attach&type=post&id=22002740[/img]\r\n\r\nBah! I don't like this section!\r\n\r\n*Disclaimer: These really aren't bugs, but things I want to improve. None of them will affect gameplay in an averse way. Don't be afraid to download. ;)\r\n\r\nI've worked for a long, long time on this mod and I'm not happy with it yet. Here are the things I'd like to improve. If you understand how I could fix any of these problems, I'd be very grateful! Pm me or leave me a comment. Thank you!\r\n\r\n1) I don't like the UV mapping error on the top of the mask. This was the best I could do uv unwrapping it with Blender, but it clearly has some seam problems. Any ideas?\r\n\r\n2) BSLightingShaderProperty may well be my bane. No one seems to know what to do with this guy (or if they do, I can't find them on google). I want the eyes of the mask and the webbing to be shiny, and the rest of the suit to be non reflective like cloth. Specular maps have no effect, and while a layer mask that controls alpha value of the normal map effects it, I'm still not at all happy with it. I also don't seem to understand the practical difference between _n and _msn, or at least how to make one vs the other.\r\n\r\n3) I think that's it. If you have found a 'bug' or have constructive criticism, please drop me a pm or comment!\r\n\r\n[img]http://static1.nexusmods.com/110/mods/110/images/15827-1-1336699278.png[/img]\r\nIf the mesh is invisible or black, it's because of a problem with Bethesda's HD Texture pack. Check out [url= forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/557650-fix-for-beth-hd-texture-pack] the fix that dimon99 provided: [/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Find your skyrim.ini file \r\n- for Windows 7 users, it will be in My Documents/My Games/Skyrim/skyrim.ini. \r\n- for others, it will be in Skyrim/Data/Skyrim.ini. \r\nOpen it. \r\n\r\n2. add HighResTexturePack01.bsa, HighResTexturePack02.bsa to the sResourceArchiveList=Skyrim line, make sure there is a , (comma) and space after each one \r\n\r\nshould look like this: \r\n\r\nsResourceArchiveList=Skyrim - Misc.bsa, Skyrim - Shaders.bsa, Skyrim - Textures.bsa, HighResTexturePack01.bsa, HighResTexturePack02.bsa, Skyrim - Interface.bsa, Skyrim - Animations.bsa, Skyrim - Meshes.bsa, Skyrim - Sounds.bsa \r\n\r\n3. save the skyrim.ini file \r\n\r\n4. open the game launcher, click on data files, and uncheck the 2 bethesda texture pack files \r\n\r\n5. you will get a warning that the game has missing files when loading your gamesave, just ignore it and click ok. \r\n\r\n[img]http://z13.invisionfree.com/IceburgsSkyrim/index.php?act=Attach&type=post&id=22002748[/img]\r\nI am currently not posting any mods on Steam Workshop. If you see one of my mods on Steam Workshop, please report the file to me. Thanks! :D\r\n\r\n[img]http://z13.invisionfree.com/IceburgsSkyrim/index.php?act=Attach&type=post&id=22002742[/img]\r\nThanks to Bethesda and Marvel. Both of you have stretched my imagination and encouraged me to be creative. :D\r\n\r\nThanks to FrankFamily for the meshed-texture idea.\r\nAlso, thanks to Angstyferrets for creating a video for the mod. :D\r\n\r\n[img]http://static1.nexusmods.com/110/mods/110/images/16020-2-1336233682.png[/IMG]\r\n",
