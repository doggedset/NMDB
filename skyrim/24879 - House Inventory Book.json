  "descriptionHtml": "Update:\r\n Fixed items you put on manequins to display now.\r\n When you open the inventory book your items will be shown imediatly (no need to close book and player inventory)\r\n !!!! If you got the first release from nexus go to your [skyrim_folder]\\\\data\\\\scripts and make sure you don\\'t have any files starting with LH_HIB. Just delete those if they are, but no other files starting with LH_ cause they may be form other mods of mine. You may wish to do the same for ...\\\\script\\\\source folder.\r\n \r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nEver wanted to quickly see what item you stored in a particular player house? To see what piece of armor/weapon you still miss from that daedric armor you collect? To see where you placed a certain unique artifact? I know I want that. Now you can do that via a book you create yourself. You will gain a book called \\\"Inventory at [Location]\\\" and when you open it (then close it) it will display the contents of a container filled with (copies of) the items you placed around the house.\r\n\r\nHow to use this:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the tanning rack, misc category and create an inventory scroll from a roll of paper.\r\n2. Go to a player house and use your scroll, you\\'ll get a book called \\\"Inventory at [Location]\\\"\r\n3. Place some stuff around your house: put items down/in containers/mannequins/etc\r\n3\\'. If you want something not to be display (like clutter for example) then enter stealth mode when you place those\r\n4. Check your book from anywhere: open your inventory book\r\n5. Repeat for other houses\r\n\r\nLimitations and other considerations:\r\n\r\n* This is CK only, I have to use what CK gives me and may not be the nicest way you may imagine the inventory to look.\r\n* It will work for items you placed in houses after starting to use this mod. If you wish to display something already there then pick it up and put it down again. \r\n* The inventory will display the base object of the item you placed meaning: \r\n   - NO player temper enhancement is displayed (like Fine to Legendary)\r\n   - NO player enchantment is displayed nor the name you gave to the item upon enchanting it\r\n   - NO renamed items via text replacement (one most unfortunate example would be thane rewards)\r\n   - NO soul name in gems from my other mod \\\"Named Souls in Gems\\\" (they use text replacement too but as I control both mods I may be able to do something if this mod will be successful)\r\n* This will work for modded houses if the modder marked the house with LocTypePlayerHouse which they should for other reasons too like the well rested bonus\r\n* Items you give a follower while inside the house are not displayed, but take care when them ask you if they can take something you dropped.\r\n* There is a mechanism to prevent taking/placing items in the inventory container by undoing what you took/placed. This is just to protect against situations when you did that by mistake, if you want to click fast enough you may end up breaking it but I won\\'t add overwhelming scripting on each itemAdded/itemRemoved operation just for the ones that try to compete with the protection. Unless there\\'s some simple \\\"magic\\\" I don\\'t know about that can simply block taking/placing items in open containers that script won\\'t be enhanced.\r\n* A possible bug in CK was identified while making this mod. If you wish to help sorting that out check the file version marked as BUGGED and 1.00 which contains a workaround and the related topics:\r\n   http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1413703-reference-from-referencealias-with-fill-type-create-cant-be-casted-to-the-type-i-know-it-is/\r\n   http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/795654-myactorplaceatmemycustomobject-as-mycustomobjectscript-is-none/",
