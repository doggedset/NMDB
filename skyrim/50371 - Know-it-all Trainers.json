  "descriptionHtml": "Have you ever had to travel all over skyrim to find that one trainer who could train you in that skill you need to improve? This mod adds trainers that will train you in all 18 skills, for a price of course.\r<br />\r<br />price scale:\r<br />\r<br />under level 50 = 250 gold\r<br />level 51-99 = 500 gold\r<br />\r<br />There is a know-it-all trainer in every faction:\r<br />College of Winterhold - Tolfdir\r<br />Companions - Vilkas\r<br />Thieves Guild - Brynjolf\r<br />Dark Brotherhood - Babette\r<br />Imperial Legion - General Tullius\r<br />Stormcloaks - Glamar StoneFist\r<br />\r<br />There are also two new trainer NPCs who can also become followers.\r<br />\r<br />Aurelia: \r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/50371-1-1390739950.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />Aurelia is the only child of a noble family from the Imperial City in Cyrodiil. Even though Aurela could have anything she could ever ask for, material things and wealth never matter to her. Aurelia \r<br />values knowledge above all else. She has traveled all over Tamriel learning from many teachers. She is prodigy of the arcane arts and practices her magic whenever possible. You will find her in the College of Winterhold Arcanaeum looking for hidden and rare texts.  She will join you on your adventure because there are some things you can&#39;t learn from just reading books.\r<br />\r<br />Zerith the Rogue\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://static2.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/50371-4-1390739951.jpg[/img]\r<br />\r<br />As his name suggests, Zerith didn&#39;t have the privileged upbringing and life of luxury enjoyed by Aurelia. Zerith started out as a highwayman at a young age in his homeland of Valenwood. After a couple of years of taking money from innocent people, he decided that power and fortune awaited him in Skyrim. Zerith again took up the Highwayman&#39;s trade until he was sent to prison for robbing a couple of farmers outside of Whiterun. He made some friends in jail who were part of a bandit group located at Halted Stream Camp and joined up with them the day he was released from jail. Zerith robbed and plundered his way up the ranks until he was promoted to second in command, but that was not good enough for the power-hungry Zerith. He waited until everything calmed down at the camp and slit the bandit leader&#39;s throat while he slept. Zerith was in command of the group of bandits for over 80 years. He retired when he had amassed such wealth that he could live the life of luxury he had dreamed of. You will find him at the Winking Skeever in Solitude wiling away his days with good drink, good food, and song. \r<br />\r<br />Know-it-all Trainers v1.1 Update:\r<br />Now you can change the amount you pay for training to the amount of gold you wish.\r<br />Just open the skyrim console and type:\r<br />\r<br />set trainingfeenovice to 300 (or any number you want) \r<br />to set the cost for training skills that are below level 51.\r<br />\r<br />set trainingfeeexpert to 1000 (or any number you want)\r<br />to set the cost for training skills that are level 51 or more.\r<br />\r<br />This mod requires:\r<br />a copy of Skyrim and the newest update\r<br />\r<br />I hope you enjoy my mod. :)\r<br />",
