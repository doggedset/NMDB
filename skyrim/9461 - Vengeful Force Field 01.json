  "summary": "Alright!! So I made this mod for my personal use, and out of fun. It adds an new perk called Fus Ro Nahkriin.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Simply put whenever enemies get close to you they are violently pushed back by an invisible force field.This comes very useful at low levels, even on higher level or if you play as a fragile wizard.\r\n\r\nBecause I\\'m barely a novice at modding you need to add this perk through the console. In game open the console and type \\\" help Nahkriin 0 \\\" without the quotes, and a few names should pop up containing the word Nahkriin. Choose the ID on the one that says \\\"Fus Ro Nahkriin\\\" and type \\\"player.addspell xxxxxxxx \\\".\r\n\r\nYou can see this perk in the magic effects menu in the game. Well that is everything there is to it. Just put the file in the Data folder. Cheers!!!! \r\n\r\nBy the way according to lore Nahkriin means \\\"Vengeance\\\" in the dragon language.\r\n\r\n",
