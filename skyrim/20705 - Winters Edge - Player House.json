  "summary": "A player house located at the end of the Winhelm docks.  Replaces the unused Warehouse",
  "descriptionHtml": "Version History:\r\nv1.0 - Original file\r\nv1.01 - Adds a firepit to the main floor and a fireplace to each bedroom (see screenshot)\r\nv1.1 - Removed the amulets from the enchanting table.  One of them was advancing a quest.  I replaced them with vanilla necklaces so you can enchant them.\r\n\r\nI always thought that the warehouse located at the end of the Windhelm docks was kind of a waste of space.  There weren\\'t any quests attached that I could find so I made a house out of it.  It replaces the the Warehouse cell.\r\n\r\nWinters Edge was the home of a retired soldier named Valgeir.  He went out to do a favor for a friend one day and never returned.  But his loss is your gain.  You can find poor Valgeir and a couple guards behind the Traders Post across the river (see screenshot).  You\\'ll need his key to get in.\r\n\r\nWinters Edge is converted warehouse with a loft and features:\r\n-All crafting stations including a smelter (outside)\r\n-Dragon Priest mask display busts\r\n-A lot of storage\r\n-A few mannequins and weapon/shield plaques and cases\r\n-A ladder on the loft that opens into Windhelm near Sadri\\'s Used Wares\r\n-A kitchen and sitting area on the loft where you can spend a few quiet hours reading or eating\r\n-A sitting area on the main floor with a couple thrones, a bench and a small bar to entertain friends or threaten enemies\r\n-Main and guest bedrooms\r\n-Banners of some of Valgeirs friends and enemies hanging on the walls\r\n-A dragon skull mounted above the door\r\n\r\nIt\\'s got a map marker, can be fast travelled to and will show up on your map. \r\nAll the chests are labelled with what I would put into them.  Kind of presumptuous of me I know, but I think they work.  If you don\\'t like them labelled let me know and I can upload a new file.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\nFollowers won\\'t enter or exit using the ladder on the loft - not sure why.  They\\'ll spawn at the front door if entering or down the road if exiting into Windhelm - but they catch back up in seconds.\r\n\r\nKnown Conflicts:\r\nAnything that affects the Warehouse.  I checked the Nexus and didn\\'t see anything but you never know.\r\n\r\nInstall/Uninstall:\r\nDownload using the Download with Manager button and activate it in the NMM \r\nor\r\nManually download the .esp file, place it in the ...\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\skyrim\\\\Data directory and activate the mod in the Skyrim launcher.\r\nUninstall - delete the .esp from the Data directory.",
