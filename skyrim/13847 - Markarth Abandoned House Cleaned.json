  "descriptionHtml": "Just listed -  \r\n\r\nBeautifully appointed one bedroom condo in the heart of downtown Markarth.  Walking distance to the shops and tavern.  Just a short trek up the hill will take you to Understone Keep for an audience with the Jarl.    Includes all crafting amenities: private forge, enchanting lab, alchemy lab and indoor cooking spit.  Fully furnished with many custom touches including cold storage for food items.  Must see to believe.  Perfect for the young Dovahkiin just starting his or her adventures. \r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial thank you to ShadenzZz and P210 for helping me work out the bugs.
