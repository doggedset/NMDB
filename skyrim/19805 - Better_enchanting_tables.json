  "descriptionHtml": "Description\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis mod allows you to place almost all enchantments on clothing or armor\r\nfor head, body, hands, and feet as well as on necklaces and rings.  A few\r\nenchantments are quite restricted (e.g., muffle can only be applied to\r\nclothing or armor for the feet).\r\n\r\nI was annoyed that you are awarded armor such as the guild master\\'s thief\r\narmor that has enhanced carry weight for the cuirass but you cannot use\r\nan enchanting table to place the same enchantment on a cuirass yourself.\r\nWhile making this change, I decided to remove a number of other enchanting\r\nrestrictions.\r\n\r\nThis mod is unbalanced as it allows you to create some extremely powerful\r\narmor and weapons.  For example, you can increase your alchemy skill by\r\ncreating alchemy enhanced equipment for the head, body, hands, feet, neck,\r\nand fingers.  Then wear this equipment and create an enhanced enchantment\r\npotion.  Then use this potion to create even more powerful alchemy gear.\r\nRepeat until you run out of ingrdients, equipment, or you simply get bored.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nJust copy the \\'Better_enchanting_tables.esp\\' file to your data folder for\r\nSkyrim.  When you start Skyrim, the data file should also be selected but\r\nthat appears to happen automatically.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\nFeel free to change and use this mod in any way.  Just credit me if you do\r\nso.",
