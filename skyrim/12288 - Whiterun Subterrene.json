  "descriptionHtml": "A very well-equipped, yet simple player home. Kinda cheater-ish, because you don\\'t have to do anything to deserve it. Includes the following amenities:\r\nBookshelves\r\nBed\r\nMerchant (fence)\r\nMannequins (more than 30)\r\nEnchanting and alchemy tables\r\nSmelter, forge, workbench, grinder\r\nAmple storage. \r\n\r\nFully navmeshed, but thanks to a CK bug, your companions still won\\'t follow you. Great. \r\n\r\nThe entrance is right next to the forge in Whiterun. Just look around next to the smelter. \r\n\r\n\r\nVersion .9:\r\nUploaded to Skyrim Nexus. \r\nAll 31 mannequins downstairs work. \r\nBookshelves are a little wonky, because they are scripted for a specific mod. \r\nWeapon racks off of the main chamber don\\'t really work, thanks to another CK bug. The weapons just kind of float off to the side. ",
