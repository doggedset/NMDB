  "descriptionHtml": "[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40615]Included and expanded in Relics of Hyrule[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[i]This mod is no longer supported because of its inclusion in Relics of Hyrule. [/i]\r<br />\r<br />Now before you start throwing full mead bottles at the screen for my clear and utter disregard for Zelda and all it stands for, shouting, &#34;THESE ARE NOT THE HOVER BOOTS I KNOW AND LOVE YOU FILTHY DODONGO BONGO BONGO&#33;&#34; Let me explain. \r<br />I did try very hard to make Hover Boots that were true to the appearance of the ones in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I tried....and failed. They looked stupid. Really stupid. \r<br />So I asked myself, &#34;Self, what would the Hover Boots have looked like in Twilight Princess if they were included? What would they look like if they were an actual artifact?&#34; \r<br />\r<br />These fine things were the result&#33; \r<br />As you can see, they have a nice wing motif, and are that lovely shade of light gold that the Hover Boots have always been. Their soles even glow if you look at them the right way&#33; \r<br />\r<br />The boots can be found in Volunruud, right next to Knevel&#39;s feet. Unless he kicked them away somehow. \r<br />They have a Waterwalking, Muffle Movement, and Reduce Fall Damage enchantment on them. And they look pretty good. \r<br />They are equal in armor to Glass boots, and can be improved with two ingots of refined moonstone if you have the Arcane Blacksmith perk. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />If for whatever reason your character never stops walking on water even if you are not wearing the Hover Boots, try entering one or both of these in the console:\r<br />\r<br />player.setav waterwalking 0\r<br />player.setav waterwalking -1\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />And if you&#39;re in an outrage that I didn&#39;t copy and paste the Hover Boots from Ocarina of Time (which is impossible), try Iceburg&#39;s boots:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/23769]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/23769[/url]\r<br />SPOILER: they&#39;re not perfect either, but they have more endorsements, so by deduction they are intrinsically better than mine&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Watch out, because text is an awful medium for sarcasm. That Spoiler is sarcastic. Get it?\r<br />Be honest in your comments, not facetious.\r<br />Otherwise I will lay my misguided vengeance upon thee.",
