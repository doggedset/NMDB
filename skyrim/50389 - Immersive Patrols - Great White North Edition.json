This is a collection of my edits to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2237521]Scrabbulor&#39;s[/url] [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12977/?]Immersive Patrols[/url].\r<br /> - I am not merging them\r<br /> - If you don&#39;t like my changes [s]I don&#39;t wanna fuckin hear it[/s] I do wanna hear it\r<br />Upon installation, the esp&#39;s I provide will overwrite the esp&#39;s provided by Scrabbulor.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffa500][size=6][font=times new roman,times,serif][b]Detailed Description[/b][/font][/size][/color]\r<br />[color=#C3C3E0][size=4][font=times new roman,times,serif][b]Immersive Brigands[/b][/font][/size][/color]\r<br />No longer are all bandits called &#34;Bandit&#34;, I gave each patrol a gang name.\r<br /> - Red Triangle Circus Bandit\r<br /> - White River Gang Bandit\r<br /> - [s]Oblivion&#39;s Angels Bandit[/s] Raiders of the Hammershield [i]thanks to TrTech for the name[/i]\r<br /> - United Blood Nation Bandit\r<br /> - Winter Hill Bandit\r<br /> - Dead Rabbits Bandit\r<br />\r<br />[color=#C3C3E0][size=4][font=times new roman,times,serif][b]Immersive Factions[/b][/font][/size][/color]\r<br />Incredibly tiny background change. I use [url=skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286]SkyRe[/url] pre-Dragonborn and in that mod the perk [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Twin_Souls#Skill_Perks]Necromancy[/url] has been removed so even though I&#39;m a huge necromancer the Witchhunters wouldn&#39;t come after me. In my mod I changed it so they come after you if you have the Necromancy perk OR the Dark Souls perk (perk above Necromancy in vanilla game).\r<br />\r<br />[color=#C3C3E0][size=4][font=times new roman,times,serif][b]Immersive Mercenaries[/b][/font][/size][/color]\r<br /> - 4 very small fixes from the USKP\r<br /> - Also I changed when they come after you, before they would appear in the same cell as you when you accumulated 1000 gold in bounty or more. Now they appear in the same cell as you if you get a bounty of [b]more than 1000 gold[/b] and your not in combat or being searched for. I can&#39;t put a delay of time on it but the more than 1000 gold sorta makes sure you have to commit more than one crime including murder and the waiting for you to be out of combat/searched for means it won&#39;t be the second you commit a crime and are seen doing it.\r<br /> - Also there level is calculated as 1.3 of the player&#39;s level i.e your level 30 there level 40. Your level 90 there level 120. Also there is no cap on there leveling, before it was 81.\r<br />- I also gave them all better perks.\r<br /> - Karina: removed ConjureFamiliar, kept VampireDrain and ConjureDremoraLord, also gave her Firebolt, Ebonyflesh and Grand Healing. Removed her dagger and gave her a Master Conjuration college robe.\r<br /> - Daoma: Full Glass gear, weapons and armor.\r<br /> - Shen: Ebony dagger, paralyzing bow and arrows. Black thieves guild outfit.\r<br /> - Malik: Full blown Companion. Skyforge Battleaxe.\r<br /> - Kodiak (formerly Paisal The Stern): Completely overhauled. I figured the original Jarl of Winterhold would hire an old school Nord and not a mage considering he hates mages. Full Nord gear. Ancient Nord Armor. Nord Hero greatsword and bow and arrows.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#C3C3E0][size=4][font=times new roman,times,serif][b]Immersive Travelers[/b][/font][/size][/color]\r<br />Crazy beefed up the bodyguards of the traveling merchants. I figure if your gonna hire just one bodyguard and your a traveling merchant he/she better be top of the line.\r<br /> - Rae: full blown Dwarven gear, armor and weapons\r<br /> - Grukag (formerly Murdock): I just changed his name\r<br /> - Fakreela: full blown Blade. Blades armor, sword and shield. Elven bow, steel arrows\r<br /> - Javier: full blown Imperial. Imperial heavy armor, sword, shield, bow and steel arrows\r<br /> - Carmella: gave her a Master destruction robe and glass dagger\r<br /> - Yahir: full blown Companion. Wolf armor. Skyforge greatsword.\r<br />[u]April 15, 2014 changes[/u]\r<br /> - All vendors and traveller&#39;s now pull there weapon from a list rather than have it be static, even though they will never use them.\r<br /> - Vendors now use [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ahkari]Ahkari&#39;s[/url] vendor chest. She travels from Dawnstar to Riften and the vendors never travel to Dawnstar so it decreases the chance of buying/selling with this mod&#39;s vendors and the Khajiit vendors and have them both be empty after going to one.\r<br /> - Bodyguards no longer have a level cap\r<br />\r<br />[color=#C3C3E0][size=4][font=times new roman,times,serif][b]Immersive Werewolves[/b][/font][/size][/color]\r<br /> - Only change is when the Silver Hand come after you. Before they would only come after you if you were a werewolf. Now they come after you if your a werewolf OR you complete a [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Silver_Hand]certain quest (spoiler)[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[color=#C3C3E0][size=4][font=times new roman,times,serif][b]Immersive Dawnguard[/b][/font][/size][/color]\r<br />Buncha changes hurr&#39;. The Dawnguardians are now more varied. They mostly spawn with a melee type weapon/crossbow combination but there is a chance they spawn with just a melee weapon or just a crossbow weapon.\r<br />In terms of melee they can now spawn with just a waraxe, [i]2 waraxes[/i], just a warhammer or a waraxe and shield. [s]Maybe in the future I&#39;ll edit them so they can spawn with 2 waraxes and dual wield.[/s]\r<br />In terms of crossbows when they hit level 50 there is a chance they can spawn with an &#34;Enhanced Crossbow&#34;. At level 60 there is a chance they can spawn with enchanted bolts. At level 70 an enchanted crossbow. No Dwarven materials, all steel stuff.\r<br />Also there patrols have a chance of spawning with a Husky (as before), a Vigilant of Stendarr or an Armored Troll.\r<br />---------\r<br />The Vampire NPC&#39;s all have unique names now:\r<br />Exiled Morbid Vampire, Exiled Rancid Vampire, Exiled Nefarious Vampire etc.\r<br />Also there patrols have a chance to spawn with a Death Hound (as before) or a Gargoyle.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffa500][size=6][font=times new roman,times,serif][b]Requirements[/b][/font][/size][/color]\r<br />Skyrim.esm\r<br />Dawnguard.esm (only required by the Immersive Dawnguard plugin)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ffa500][size=6][font=times new roman,times,serif][b]Extended Information[/b][/font][/size][/color]\r<br /> - Keep an eye on this page in the future.
