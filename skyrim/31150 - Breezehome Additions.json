  "descriptionHtml": "I created this mod so that i could have all the aspects of breeze home at once.\r\nThe game additions set forth by hearthfire replace the lab with the addition of a childs room, so in order to keep all items i simply lowered the alchemy lab down one floor.\r\nHowever, being a modeler at heart i am never satisfied... hence the other additions i have since added here in this mod!",
