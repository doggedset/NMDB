  "descriptionHtml": "Since my PC is about 10 years old and it cannot handle that well these amazing weapons by JaySuS.\r\nSo I decided to simply resize textures by half (1024x1024 and some 512x1024) with DDSOpt. And here you go, it is not much but it will help people who also might be experiencing issues with high resolution textures that JaySuS uses.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n1. In case you did not installed JaySuS Swords mod yet, go get it right here - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1002\r\n2. Just copy Data folder to your Skyrim root directory\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n-JaySuS for making these outstanding weapons and giving me permission to upload this\r\n",
