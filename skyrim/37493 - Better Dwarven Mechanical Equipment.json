  "descriptionHtml": "[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14060/?]Dwarven Mechanical Equipment[/url] by raden5 is an awesomely designed mod that adds animation to your shield and dagger when sheathing your weapons and drawing them. It had quiet a few annoying bugs and quirks though. The player when, drawing his weapon, would play the animation and sound twice. The animation didn\\'t match the weapons much either since you would end up reaching to the other side of your body to try and grab thin air.\r\n\r\nI haven\\'t completely gotten rid of the double draw bug yet, but I have made it far less noticeable by adding custom, and stealthier, sheath and draw sounds. Also, the animation has been made to look more like you are stabbing someone instead of flailing your arm around in the air. The draw animation is considerably faster due to the new stance. I however had to cut out the left blade from this. I just couldn\\'t get the mesh to stay in one place. I have left the requirement in that you must complete Unfathomable Depths before they items can be crafted.\r\n\r\nThis version requires SKSE and is a complete replacer for the original mod.",
