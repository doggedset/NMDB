  "descriptionHtml": "This is the dungeon from the wiki tutorial for beginners. i used to mod for oblivion but im just getting used to doing it again. I added some other things from the wikis into this dungeon. For my first mod i thought i would try one of the tutorials on the creation kit page.\r\nIts my first mod but everyone has to start somewhere! It is west of riverwood.\r\nThere are a few tutorial weapons in the main room just a test and they should be craft able.\r\nEntrance is just west of riverwood \r\nit has 6 test rooms: one with storage with leveled items in it one using a nordic kit and a cave kit and just a few more rooms for testing. I will update with more useful things and possibly a teleport spell to it for moving storage. Like i said this is my first mod and i appreciate constructive criticism so fell free to comment with ideas and bugs (i know its floating thats another bug)\r\nI am also working on making it a house dungeon with azuras star rooms and more so its a work in progress.",
