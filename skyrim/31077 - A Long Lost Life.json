  "modName": "A Long Lost Life",
  "summary": "A short mod I made over about 2 days. It is the story of man\\'s grandfather who was never put to rest.",
  "descriptionHtml": "BACKGROUND:\r\nI made this mod in about 2 days while working on a Biology project, so as you can expect there are some bugs. I am currently releasing this to see if anyone finds some more bugs, or has some recommendations for the mod. It is in early BETA. This means it is currently in a heavy testing phase, and is still under development.\r\n\r\nSTORY:\r\nThe main part of the story can be found upon entering Jargrief\\'s Crypt. There are 2 books when you enter. The one to your left explains the story, and the one to the right is basically a longer copy of the above. \r\n\r\nFUTURE ADDITIONS:\r\nLater on I will be adding 2 more crypts, and making the current one much more complex. Right now it is a + shape, and is very boring. This is my first mod, so please no raging at it.\r\n\r\nBUG TESTING:\r\nIf you find any bugs, then please put them in the comments for this mod. All help is appreciated, so please do not withhold a bug because you think it has already been found. I may believe it is fixed only to find out it was persisting.\r\n\r\nQUEST START:\r\nTalk to Johansson Pickstorm in the Bannered Mare Inn.\r\n\r\nOTHER:\r\nPlease check out my YouTube channel here: http://www.youtube.com/user/numberboxgamer\r\n\r\nThe SEQ File:\r\nYOU MUST ADD THE SEQ FILE TO YOUR DATA FOLDER. When it is downloaded you will get a .zip file. Extract it, and place the QSP folder directly into your data folder. I do not know why this has to happen, but it does.\r\n\r\nCHANGELOG:\r\nVersion 0.1\r\n*Fixed broken dialog  \r\n*Fixed lighting glitches  \r\n*Fixed broken Draugrs  \r\n\r\nVersion 0.0.1\r\n*Main Release ",
