  "descriptionHtml": "Changed Dawnguard Heavy Armor stats from regular Steel to Steel Plate, I felt it was way underpowered.  You can find Nord Plate armor or Orcish armor right from the start of the game if you go to the right places.  So why is the Dawnguard Heavy Armor so weak that its only as good as steel but takes from the advanced armors tree?\r\n\r\nWell now its as good as Steel Plate, so it\\'s not worthless to use when you get it at earlier levels.\r\n\r\n",
