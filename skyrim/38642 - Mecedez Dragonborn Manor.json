  "descriptionHtml": "HUSH. It\\\\\\'s been quite a while since I planned to make this mod - about half a year ago. My design isn\\\\\\'t very complicated, but quite abundant. Because ALL OF MY TEXTURE COMES FROM THE ORIGINAL TES V GAME. \r\n\r\nBEGAN USING THIS MOD:\r\n\r\nYou should reach The Throat of the World - that\\\\\\'s where my entrance is set. If you haven\\\\\\'t proceed far enough in the main quests yet, you can climb the mountain using your horse.\r\n\r\n(with pictures below)\r\n\r\nLet\\\\\\'s see what we can find inside the portal. See the small island not far away? Living there are two unaggressive giants and a mammoth. Those peace-loving creatures are your neighbors.\r\n\r\nYou can ask them for cheese. And if you insist, you can help yourself with their incredible toes that have never been cleaned.\r\n\r\n(with pictures below)\r\n\r\nI\\\\\\'ve designed almost all of the basic facilities inside our manor. Nevertheless, if you want to use the Atronach Forge, you still have to go to the Winterhold College.\r\n\r\nThe mill can produce flour from wheat.\r\n\r\n(with pictures below)",
