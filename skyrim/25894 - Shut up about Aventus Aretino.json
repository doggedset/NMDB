  "summary": "Prevents the guards\\' dialogue about Aventus\\' Black Sacrament from adding Innocence Lost to your quest log.",
  "descriptionHtml": "Don\\'t feel particularly sneaky?\r\nAre you more a hack-and-slash kinda guy? Maybe a bit too morally constrained to murder for money?\r\nOr is it that you just don\\'t feel like having anything to do with the Dark Brotherhood this time around?\r\n\r\nWell, if you\\'re like me and the last one applied to you, once again I am here to help.\r\nI often start new characters and go different routes with them, but I hate quests I don\\'t plan on doing clogging up the log. This meant that any time I wanted to visit Windhelm talking to the guards was a big no-no unless I wanted to do the DB\\'s quests.\r\n\r\nThis mod means you no longer have to dodge guards even when you\\'re a law-abiding citizen.\r\nI\\'ve stripped the scripts from those lines of dialogue and rendered them harmless in that aspect.\r\n\r\nSadly, the scene between Grimvar and Idesa will still give you the quest if you get close enough to trigger it. I don\\'t know how I would be able to locate the dialogue in this scene in order to strips its scripts. Thankfully it\\'s in an out of the way place, so you\\'d really only trip it if you were looking for it.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nJust drop the .esp into your data folder and tick it off in your mod manager of choice, whether that be the default launcher or the Nexus Mod Manager.
