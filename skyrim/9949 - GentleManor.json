  "descriptionHtml": "[b]Like this?, then please endorse[/b]\r\nand help spread the word and let more people have the enjoyment this mod offers ;D\r\n\r\n[quote=Moar Mods:]Liked GentleManor?\r\nWhy not try Optimised Breezehome?:\r\n[url=file.php?id=8104]Optimised Breezehome[/url]\r\n\r\nOptimised Breezehome is a small mod modifying Breezehome to make it more usefull and look and work better.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[u]Description:[/u]\r\n\r\nWith this mod I want to offer players a unique fully equipped home for any playstyle (thieves in particular), in the Riften like Manor style.\r\nThis because Honeyside (the thief like home) is not really appealing to me and I am rather dissappointed in its looks and effectiveness, certainly compared to the superior Hjeirm.\r\nThis after fully enjoying the Thieves Guild quest line and so I decided to create a mod offering what I wanted and hopefully what others want as well.\r\n\r\nI thought that thief like characters should have a home where they feel at home, one better suited for the guildmaster of the Thieves Guild than Honeyside.\r\nI created a medium sized manor and made it into the ultimate thieves home, GentleManor (a play on the Gentleman and Manor, for the fancy thief of course ;D).\r\nThis is a complete Riften styled playerhome made for thieves and other play styles, complete with everything you will ever need.\r\nIt\\'s located conveniently just outside Riverwoord and reachable by fast travel.\r\n\r\n[b]Features:[/b]\r\n\r\n- Completely new build player home in Riten style and fully decorated\r\n- a Complete smithy\r\n- a Display room and trophy room\r\n- It has a secret basement with tons of handy stuff.\r\n- 2 secret hatches to: \r\n      -The ragged Flagon (in Riften)\r\n      - The Bannered Mare (in Whiterun)\r\n- a Thief trophy holder (same as in the Ragged Flagon Cistern)\r\n- Plenty of mannequins, Weapons plaques, Display cases and Weapon racks\r\n- a study with arcane enchanter etc.\r\n- Secret hatches to Riften and the Thieves Guild\r\n- Map marker to travel directly to the front door\r\nand of course:\r\n- Enough storage, to store what ever you want, where ever you want\r\n- off course [b]fully nav. meshed[/b]\r\n- Fully uses portals etc. to make performance better\r\n\r\n[u]GentleManor Vault:[/u]\r\nWith version 2.0 a Vault is added, this one has a seperate key.\r\nThe Vault can be used to store your riches and loot.\r\nIt is in a different cell to not influence the performance of GentleManor.\r\n\r\nIt has:\r\n\r\n- Enough storage to do..... whatever thieves do ;D\r\n- A special suprise from the Unholy Maiden (Nocturnal)\r\n- Did I mention storage? :D\r\n\r\nand some [u]servants:[/u]\r\n\r\n- Guards to keep it lively (inside and outside)\r\n- a Blacksmith/merchant\r\n- a Fence Merchant\r\n- a Khajiit servant (why Imperial when you can has Khajiit)\r\n\r\n\r\n[b] Entering:[/b]\r\n\r\nTo enter this house of thieves, steal the key from the guards outside (you are a thief eh?) or use console commands (type help gentle 0 and add the key with player.additem keyID or unlock the door))\r\n\r\n[u]Update Notes:[/u]\r\n\r\n[b]Before Updating to 2.0[/b] make sure you have the night stands and wardrobe in the bedroom empty, since they have been changed.\r\n\r\n[b]v2.0[/b]\r\n\r\n- Adds a whole new area, the Vault, where you can store items etc.\r\n- GentleManor now uses portals for better performance\r\n- Mannequin in the Display room now works\r\n- Fixed several misplacement issues\r\n- Fixed lots of lightinh\r\n- GentleManor now does no longer influence vanilla Skyrim items and objects\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]v1.02[/b]\r\n- Fixed misplacement issues and some stuff is moved.\r\n- Added some banners\r\n- Replaced the Riften trapdoor with one leading to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun, since\r\n  directly linking to citys seems impossible.\r\n\r\n[b]v1.01[/b]\r\n- Fixed misplacement issue and various staggering bugs\r\n- Fixed Merchant\r\n- Replaced guard by different guards\r\n- Now different guards on the in and outside\r\n- Added a Khajiit butler ;D\r\n\r\n[u]bug notes:[/u]\r\n\r\nThis home is not yet completely bug free.\r\nThe creation kit seems to move stuff around on its own (which is reall frustrating and I keep fixing graphical glitches thanks to that)\r\n\r\n[b]Bugs:[/b]\r\n\r\n- some minor misplacing issues (Creation Kit seems to move stuff on its own and so I keep finding small stuf that\\'s just not optimally placed.)\r\n\r\nI am working on this, and actively searching for bugs.\r\nfeel free to point any out\r\n\r\nThis is my second mod ever, so there may be stuff not optimal, again please point them out and and i\\'ll try to fix them ASAP\r\n\r\n[u]NOTES:[/u]\r\n\r\n[b]Yes, this is a re-upload,[/b] I re-uploaded it because downloads were sometimes malfunctioning and comments did not work at all.\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\n\r\n[b]mgbeach[/b]\r\nfor helping me with the book shelves encouraging me to try to reverse engineer\r\n\r\n[b]Th3uNKn0wN[/b] \r\nfor suggesting what to do with the lighting\r\n\r\n",
