  "descriptionHtml": "I am pretty new at this nexus-site and I can\\'t really seem to find a way to get my request out in the bigger picture. I have a idea of some mods that would go perfect with Dawnguard. Only problem is that I don\\'t know anything about making mods. I have a pretty good skills of photoshop and so but no programming skill what so ever. I have the detecation that it takes but not the skill. If anyone sees this, help a brother out. \r\n\r\nI have idea about a \\\"crucifix-torch\\\" just like a torch looking like a big crucifix with the power to make vampires flee or stay away when low on health. I dont think it\\'\\'s a problem making, if you know how to do it..  Also, how about a mod that makes the crossbow fully automatic? Like In the van helsing movie. If you haven\\'t seen it. Do see it. \r\nAnd last, the clothing. Not a very important mod when almost every piece of clothing in skyrim is legit to this movie. But Maybe a Amish-cowboy-looking hat? Like the one he wears in the movie. \r\n\r\nI dont know if anyone vill just trash this \\\"idea\\\" because its not a mod. But I don\\'t know where to put it... I\\'m sorry!",
