  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod and my first attempt at modding, just adding a simple weapon into the game that I&#39;ve wanted for a long while. It looks nothing like it and I&#39;m not sure whether I want to make it one or two handed yet but eventually I will eventually create my own animations for it utilizing my favorite of his combinations but for now I hope you like it, and just fyi, in the game I am taking this from the weapon is quite strong as I made it, unfortunately I had to make it one handed for it to look similar, and yea I hope you like it, if anyone has any advice for modding let me know",
