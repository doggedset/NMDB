  "descriptionHtml": "Requires Dawnguard and Update 1.8\r\n\r\nWelcome to Ace\\'s Vampire Home!\r\n\r\n:: Description ::\r\nThis mod is a vampire home in the mountains overlooking Whiterun. Everything that is needed to enchant, craft etc is in the home, all you have to do is kill the owner Ace and his guards.\r\nIt includes some new drain spells, weapon and royal vampire armor with some good enchantments in a secret room. There\\'s a room that teleports you hidden areas in most cities, useful for starving vampires. Another room with a few thralls for you too feed on. There\\'s a coffin for you and another coffin for your companion, whether they\\'re a vampire or not they can sleep there. A meal area, also some mannequins and empty chests. The blood chalice that adds to your drain spell and a Molag Bal shrine. I\\'ve probably missed a few small things but those are the major ones.\r\n\r\nThe 2 spells are both drain oriented. One which is similar to the Vampire lord drain spell but not as powerful and the other is a drain rune spell. I\\'ve tested both on expert and master difficulty and the do well. \r\n\r\nThe armor is a full set of Royal vampire armor plus the vampire hood. It should be the same one that Serana wears.\r\n\r\nEven if you\\'re not a vampire and wish to be one, taking on Ace and his gang will certainly infect you unless you\\'re only using range from a far distance.\r\n\r\n:: Plans ::\r\nI hope to connect the owner to the secret room with all his secret gear. He\\'s planning on taking on Dawnguard on his own you see. I was thinking of having a letter on his body.\r\nIf anyone finds a bug let me know and I\\'ll get on it. Any way you can think to improve the mod let me know and I\\'ll try and implement it.\r\nIf anyone knows how to make the marker unable to travel without discovering the location I\\'d appreciate it if you taught me how. This is my first mod but I\\'ve tested it for 19 levels and I haven\\'t had any problems with it. The drain spells and the armor are actually useful. I\\'ve been able to hold myself in against small quite a few enemies without taking the impact perk. I haven\\'t used the weapon though but it should work well. I should add weapons for another types of vampires, if anyone can think of a good model to use it for I\\'ll do the rest.\r\n\r\n:: Location ::\r\nIt\\'s located South West of Whiterun but you\\'ll have to take the path up the mountain from Riverwood. You\\'ll be able to see the marker as I haven\\'t figured out how to make it discoverable yet. This will change in future updates.\r\n\r\n:: Install ::\r\nDrop the esp file into the data folder and then tick it and you should be good to go. \r\nIt should be NMM safe now.\r\n\r\n:: Uninstall ::\r\nRemove my esp while no where near the home. I suggest you place the items in one of the chests just to be safe but it shouldn\\'t matter.\r\n\r\n:: Update ::\r\n1.4 Added signs and fixed a few small things. No more grey face.\r\n1.3 No more respawning vampies, changed carpet and fixed a few small bugs.\r\n1.2 Ace\\'s guards don\\'t respawn anymore.\r\n1.1: Fixed script problem.\r\n\r\nSPOILER to secret room: Have a read, browse the book shelf.\r\n",
