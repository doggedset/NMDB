  "modName": "Forelhost - DELETED",
  "summary": "Now you can live in Forelhost ...if you totally crazy.",
  "descriptionHtml": "It&#39;s still dark dirty Forelhost, but with shelfs, chests, urns, items and etc. Forelhost is a common tomb in TES:Skyrim, where you can take a quest for Raghot mask, but now you can live here.\r<br />It have several parts:\r<br />HALL - which looks like library more. You can throw off books and put there other items or normal books. For books it takes really long time, since where is no shelf activators. I decided not to do common shelf (and display cases too) since maybe you want to put something other there.\r<br />KITCHEN - just a common kitchen. You can prepare meals there.\r<br />STOREROOM - with sacks and alchemy laboratory.\r<br />BLACKSMITH ROOM - there you can find all for creating weapons and armor. It have mannequin and safes.\r<br />ENCHANT LABORATORY - here you can see table for enchanting, strongboxes, urns, chest and many weapon racks. To be honest, it looks more like weapon store room.\r<br />\r<br />----------------------------------------------------------\r<br />OPTIONAL FILES:\r<br />\r<br />Forelhost Forge - it&#39;s just an anvil, but you can forge here draugr weapons and armors, hero nordic weapons and dragon priests masks without enchanting, but you can add your own. Need Dawnguard and Dragonborn addons. I recommend you to download &#34;Cloaks of Skyrim&#34; and &#34;zzDraugr Parts&#34; mods for this.\r<br />\r<br />Forelhost Merchants - two ghosts Misty and Ashley who buys and sell items. I added them because I really tired walking around all Skyrim for to sell items. You can buy here ghost weapons and potions for to be invisible or ghost.\r<br />\r<br />Forelhost Tower - it&#39;s a tower near Forelhost, but now it&#39;s a good house where lives smith, who can sell you armors from dungeons. You can take this guy as your follower. Also you can find here ghost horse...actually it&#39;s looks weird when you try to ride D= Need Dawnguard and Dragonborn addons. If you have Creation kit, you can delete smith from the house (ForelhostTower) and use it as your own home...or if you play for female character you can leave as it is.\r<br />\r<br />Forelhost Valmir - high elf who asking you about to find a mask in Forelhost. After you took his quest, he can sell you weapons and armors. Need Dawnguard and Dragonborn addons. You don&#39;t need it if you already cleared Forelhost, or you need to start new game to see him.\r<br />\r<br />Forelhost Draugrs - last file for Forelhost. Now you can take draugrs as your followers. Dusty and Flat you can find in Forelhost Crypt. Rahgot will be waiting you in Forelhost Refectory. WARNING&#33; This file better activate after main quest is complete.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />----------------------------------------------------------\r<br />For this house, better to use Decorate Assistant (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13586 or http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2475) or Jaxonz Positioner (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52583)",
