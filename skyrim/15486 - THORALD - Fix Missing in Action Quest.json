It might be fixed by installing the Unofficial Skyrim Patch.Â \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />THORALD\r<br />Note: if you downloaded &#34;Fix Missing in Action&#34; before, you can just overwrite it with this. \r<br />Also available on Steam Workshop. \r<br />\r<br />This is a fix for the missing peaceful way to finish Missing in Action. \r<br />Save Thorald without bloodshed&#33;\r<br />\r<br />==What it does==\r<br />Imperial Note received from Tullius, if you are part of the Imperal Legion&#33;\r<br />Makes the Thalmor guard escort you. \r<br />Finish the quest peacefully without a failed objective in your log.\r<br />Imperial Note actually has text in it now. \r<br />\r<br />==Notes==\r<br />You won&#39;t be able to finish this quest peacefully as a Stormcloak, for obvious reasons.\r<br />This mod does not change any other quests.\r<br />I am not going to add more ways to solve this quest. You may use this mod and change it in Creation Kit if you want, as long as you credit me. \r<br />\r<br />*spoiler**spoiler**spoiler**spoiler*\r<br />Talk to Thorald after saving him when you&#39;re out of the fort, or you will be attacked. I&#39;ve tried to fix this, but no matter what, the Thalmor kept becoming hostile.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />==Files==\r<br />QF_MS09_0001CF26.pex\r<br />TIF__0003AF78.pex\r<br />TIF__000524D6.pex\r<br />TIF__0008994A.pex\r<br />Thorald.esp",
