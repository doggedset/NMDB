  "descriptionHtml": "Skyforge redone the way I think it should of been.  I added some clutter, workbench, smelter, tanning rack.  All clutter shoud go away for the funeral, and return afterwards.  I added a skyforge armory with a guard.  You have to be a companion to remove stuff from the armory, unless you fight the guard.  Lastly I made the skyforge steel weapons craftable at the skyforge.  You must have the Arcane smithing perk, as well as be level 50 or higher in smithing.",
