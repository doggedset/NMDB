  "descriptionHtml": "Thought I made my own home in Skyrim. Found out about Hearthfire, and have been itching about making my own, lore-friendly, home.\r<br />\r<br />The house is located in Whiterun, exterior of Dragon&#39;s Reach. For now, it&#39;s shown on the map and I have no idea how to set it to *getting discovered*.\r<br />I added a vendor in the house, Kahjiit. He sells alcoholic beverages and a couple of food (food is for the purpose of &#34;Realistic Needs and Diseases&#34;).\r<br />\r<br />The house, the design, and the bits in it is still incomplete. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m missing, but I&#39;m feeling so. I&#39;d really appreciate some inputs on making it a better lore-friendly home.\r<br />\r<br />Currently, I plan on making some kind of a treasure hunt without the need for activations (quests)\r<br />Just make some notes, just like the one you may find on the doorstep of Wilderhome\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m staying away from:\r<br />Vendor being able to buy (although if you want to earn some gold from him, change/add gold to his vending items)\r<br />Alchemy lab\r<br />Enchanting table\r<br />\r<br />This is my first mod ever created, and decided I share my piece.\r<br />\r<br />I suggest these mods that I can&#39;t play without:\r<br />Realistic Needs and Diseases\r<br />Frostfall\r<br />Realistic Lighting Overhaul\r<br />Drinking Gives You Bottles",
