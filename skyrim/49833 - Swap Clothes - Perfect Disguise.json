  "descriptionHtml": "Ok, I had a lot of stuff to do and suddenly some strange idea came to me, I play as a mage and always did so I create a couple spells sometime, simple spells to make Skyrim more funny, and this one I made today and he does exactly what is in the title, he swaps your clothes with someone else.\r<br />NOTE: Some clothes in the game (I don&#39;t know for sure if it&#39;s cuz other mods are running too) may not appear immediately on you, or you&#39;ll get bald or your head simple disappear, but relax, just put a ring or a necklace and you&#39;re fine again. Initial Release.\r<br />\r<br />~REQUIRES SKSE~\r<br /> The Spellbook can be found on the Arch-mage&#39;s Quarter, on the Arcane Enchanter :)\r<br />Anything, yell, or contact me via email, pm.. leave a comment below... up to you",
