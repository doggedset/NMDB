  "descriptionHtml": "--- Version 1 (18.12.2011) - Initial Release, Info Below.\r\n--- Version 2 (20.12.2011) - New feature - can reanimate anyone to fight for your permanently. No more level restriction. Third version will bring ability to have two Thralls, but also some kind of handicap so it isn\\'t overpowered.\r\n\r\n\r\n// DEMO\r\n\r\nVideo Demo - Master Difficulty: \r\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?kc1u4prm7141k0p\r\n\r\n-- Draugr Deathlord vs Horkers :)\r\n\r\nYou can see that I implemented all of the Thrall capabilities. Deathlord uses weapon I put on him before reanimation and repeatedly uses shouts.\r\n\r\n-- Vampire Mage vs Giants\r\n\r\nHere you see Vampire using ALL it\\'s abilities including dodging, life drain and doing everything to keep alive. Witness the power.\r\n\r\nAnyway, just wanted to show that Thralls you can reanimate now behave like they normally do. Nothing is bugged or taken away.\r\n\r\n// MAIN INFO\r\n\r\nDead Thrall spell can only be used on people. And even that is limited - no mage type characters.\r\nNow you can reanimate ALMOST everyone! People, Undead and Creatures!\r\n\r\n// ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\n- Everything about the spell is the same except added ability to reanimate more NPCs.\r\n\r\n// POSSIBLE BUGS\r\n\r\n- In rare instance, after fast traveling your Thrall might drop dead. Just reanimate him again.\r\n- In rare instances, Thralls can get stuck. Move away from the area either by fast traveling or going to another area so Thrall can \\\"reboot\\\"\r\n- Maybe something else I haven\\'t seen. Please report in comments\r\n\r\n// INSTALLATION\r\n\r\n1. Copy FluxMOD_DeadThrallEnhanced_v1.esp to game data dir. Example: C:\\\\Games\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data\\\\\r\n2. Mod will be enabled by default but you can check if it is in Data Files in the Skyrim Launcher.\r\n3. Enjoy reanimating powerful companions!\r\n\r\n// ABOUT\r\n\r\nMod made by argie (FluxMODs)\r\n\r\nCODEFLUX RELEASES ARE ALWAYS MALWARE FREE!\r\n\r\nCODEFLUX RCE\r\nhttp://www.codeflux.com.hr/",
