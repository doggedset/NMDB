  "descriptionHtml": "Ever wondered why Orc Tribes in Skyrim don\\'t use Orcish Armory at all?\r\nWell, this always buged me out, so I decided to make this little \\\"fix\\\" that make all Orc in the Tribes wear Orcish Amor and Weapons. The Chieftains wear a full set including the Helm. the Warriors and Scouts wear Orichs Armor without the Helm, the Shamans wear Black Hooded Warlock Robes and the Blacksmiths and Miners wears Blacksmith and Miner Clothes.\r\n\r\nThis is my First Mod, so tell me if you find any bug or any tribe member that isn\\'t using the Orcish Armor.",
