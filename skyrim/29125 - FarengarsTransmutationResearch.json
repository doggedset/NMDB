  "descriptionHtml": "This is a small mod that uses the base transmutation script but doesn\\\\\\'t change it in any way.\r\n\r\nThere are 11 spells added by this mod to allow transmutation freedom, each spell will first turn the ore into an ingot and then change the ingot type.\r\n\r\nThe spells are\r\n\r\nTransmute Corundum to Iron\r\nTransmute Corundum to Orichalcum\r\nTransmute Ebony to Corundum\r\nTransmute Gold to Ebony\r\nTransmute Iron to Silver\r\nTransmute Iron to Steel\r\nTransmute Malachite to Moonstone\r\nTransmute Moonstone to Corundum\r\nTransmute Orichalcum to Malachite\r\nTransmute Quicksilver to Gold\r\nTransmute Silver to Quicksilver\r\n\r\nThis freedom allows you to mass transmute without having to drop ores, It also allows you to cycle through the transmutations so you can turn any ore to any ingot (but steel is a dead end).\r\n\r\nI have left out Daedric as it is not a pure metal, I have also left out Dwarven Metal due to its mysterious nature, I hope you enjoy the spells.\r\n\r\nThey can be found in Farengars study/library area on the bookshelves, there is a research research journal on the desk that adds a bit of backstory to why Farengar has these spells.\r\n",
