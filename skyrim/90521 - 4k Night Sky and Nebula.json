  "descriptionHtml": "Simple mod, not much to say here.  Replaces the night sky star field and nebula textures with those seen in the screenshots.\n<br />\n<br />You may have to adjust your enbseries.ini starintensity setting under the [SKY] section if the nebula and stars are to bright/dim for you.  Mine looked good between 2.0 to 2.5\n<br />\n<br />If you like these, come back and leave an endorsement.  Hate the textures?  There are others out there and you won't hurt my feelings if you don't use it.\n<br />\n<br />Note about my mods:  I make things to suit my own tastes.  I do not usually consider if it will appeal to the majority of nexus users.  I release them in case others would like to enjoy them.  I welcome critiques, but if you come to the comments to just outright complain about something without offering constructive feedback, i'll just block you from my mods.",
