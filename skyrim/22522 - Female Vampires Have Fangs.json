Such as your character once she has changed into a vampire and any npc listed in the Creation Kit as a vampire race , such as nordvampire , imperialvampire etc.....This will not work on any companions unless they are flagged as one of the vampire races ....[/SIZE][/COLOR][/B]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[B][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=3]Installation:[/SIZE][/COLOR][/B]\r\nCopy meshes folder to data folder\r\n\r\n\r\n[B][COLOR=#ff0000][SIZE=3]List of my other mods[/SIZE][/COLOR][/B]\r\n[*][URL=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7782]\r\nAcDale\\'s Armor N Clothing Compilation[/URL] \r\n[*][URL=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=5390]Acdale\\'s EyeCandy Body (ADEC)[/URL]\r\n\r\n",
