  "descriptionHtml": "So you&#39;re probably thinking &#34;Man, you know what, after Brhuce Hammar, Call of Trainwiz, and Transportato, what I really need is more trains&#33;&#34; and you&#39;re also probably thinking &#34;Man, dragons suck, I wish someone would replace them with Thomas the Tank Engine Characters&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />Well fear not&#33; I have heard your thoughts, because I am amazing like that, and have decided to answer your prayers with this new mod, Really Useful Dragons.\r<br />What does it do you ask? Did you not just read the previous part?\r<br />\r<br />FEATURES\r<br />__________________\r<br />All vanilla dragon models replaced with Thomas the Tank Engine characters. Yep. You read that right.\r<br />All dragon sounds replaced with appropriate sounds. This doesn&#39;t count voices though, I&#39;m not willing to rip Ringo Starr&#39;s voice just yet.\r<br />Some dragon spells replaced with more appropriate versions of said spells. You&#39;ll see what I mean.\r<br />\r<br />COMPATIBILIITYTYTYAER\r<br />__________________\r<br />This mod modifies Dragon armoraddons and sounds. Anything that modifies those will be incompatible. However, things that modify dragons stats are fine.\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS\r<br />__________________\r<br />Haishao and Shippin for model help\r<br />Thomas for model inspiration, creepy, horrifiyng inspiration. Said models are models released under the GPL v2 license and have been approve for use by the authors involved.",
