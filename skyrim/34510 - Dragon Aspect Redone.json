  "summary": "Removes the Power restriction of the Dragon Aspect Shout, allowing for unlimited use of the shout per day. Cooldown times are the same as Storm Call.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I didn\\'t like the \\\"Once a day\\\" restriction for Dragon Aspect, so I just threw this together so I could use the coolest looking shout as much as I wanted. I also edited the description to match the change, and increased the cooldowns to balance it out.\r\n\r\nI did not change anything else regarding the shout, I left the effects as is. I just wanted to look cool whenever I wanted.\r\n\r\nThe only issue right now is with the shout itself. Casting it twice in a row removes the visual effects, but casting it a third time re-adds the effects. I guess this only applies if you can get full shout reduction, but I\\'m just throwing it out there.",
