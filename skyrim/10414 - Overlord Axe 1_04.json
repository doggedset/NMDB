  "modName": "Overlord Axe 1_04",
  "summary": "An evil-looking, oversized two-hander, in four versions, plus 1h and 2h versions for each",
  "descriptionHtml": "WHAT IT DOES\r\n\r\nIt adds a new oversized two-handed axe, called the Ancient Overlord\\'s Axe. In fact, it adds three versions, a completely oversized one, and two slightly more in line with the normal game items. All three also come in larger two-handed versions and smaller one-handed versions.\r\n\r\nIt also adds an Overlord\\'s Scythe, and respectively the one-hand version called an Overlord\\'s Kama, though it\\'s really just a scaled-down one-hander European-style scythe.\r\n\r\nIt has a sturdy octogonal metal shaft, with leather wrap on the lower half for better grip, and two broad blades, perfect for cleaving through those pesky heroes threatening an overlord\\'s rule or just through the peasants showing up with torches and pitchforks. It is rusty, although not as much as an ancient weapon could get over the centuries, but the blade edges have obviously seen some quality time with a grindstone recently. (Note that I usually dislike rusty weapons, but this was the most obvious way to make it look ancient.)\r\n\r\nIt is furthermore tastefully decorated with two small polished silver skulls, placed to create the striking visual impression of a human skull on a spike from either side. Guaranteed to make an impression, whether you\\'re hewing down heroes at the front of your Legions Of Doom, or granting audiences while sitting on your Throne Of Skulls in your Fortress Of Doom.\r\n\r\nTruly a great accessory to any Spiked Armour Of Doom, and a fine choice of weapon for the discerning Evil Overlord.\r\n\r\nBalance-wise, \r\n\r\n- the smaller axes and scythes are on par for weight, speed and base damage with the daedric two-handed and respectively one-handed axes, except they have twice the chance to crit. \r\n\r\n- the bigger axe is on par for weight, speed and base damage with the daedric two-handed hammers and respectively one-hander hammer, except again it crits twice as much. I figure all that extra metal in the axe head ought to realistically make it slower and harder hitting.\r\n\r\nAll versions are craftable and upgradable with the same ingredients as the daedric counterparts listed above.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO GET IT\r\n\r\nAt the end of the WolfSkull cave, or more precisely the WolfSkull ruins part, after you kill the boss and lower the drawbridge, cross the drawbridge and there\\'ll be a nord chest to your left. The axes are in it, along with a bunch of other, more mundane stuff. It\\'ll be locked, but it\\'s a very easy lock. Still, bring a lockpick or two. If you don\\'t know where the caves are, you get a quest to clear them from the Solitude palace.\r\n\r\nOr, if you\\'re the less honourable type, word on the street is that the blacksmith in Solitude recently bought some of these from some adventurer and still has them somewhere in his smithy. Someone light footed and skilled with a lockpick could probably get a five finger discount on it. (Note that he\\'s NOT actually selling it. But you can steal it from him instead of going all the way down WolfSkull cave, if you can open a master-level lock.)\r\n\r\nOr you can craft them, if you can do daedric smithing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO INSTALL IT\r\n\r\nExtract the archive, with directories, in your \\\"Data\\\" folder. Select it in the list of plugin files in the launcher.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO UNINSTALL IT\r\n\r\nDelete the .esp file from your Data directory.\r\n\r\nDelete the OverlordAxe directory in both the Meshes\\\\Weapons and Textures\\\\Weapons directories.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFLICTS\r\n\r\nIt shouldn\\'t conflict with anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\n\r\nThe skull and skull texture are a reprocessed version of Bethesda\\'s, so I can\\'t give you permission to that. It\\'s fair game though if you want to include this in a Skyrim mod.\r\n\r\nThe rest is my own work and I release it in the public domain. You can do anything you wish with it. I would, of course, appreciate it if you give credit, but if not, so be it, I can live with that too.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERSION HISTORY\r\n\r\n1.04:\r\n\tFixed the blood mesh for the one-handers. Oops. Sorry for the screw-up.\r\n\r\n1.03:\r\n\tRenamed all two handers from \\\"Ancient Overlord\\'s Axe\\\" to \\\"Overlord\\'s Battleaxe\\\"\r\n\tAdded one-hander versions called \\\"Overord\\'s Waraxe\\\"\r\n\tAdded the Scythe and Kama, since it seems to fit the whole theme of death theme\r\n\r\n1.02:\r\n\tBLOOD\r\n\tAdded Axe 3\r\n\r\n1.01:\r\n\tMade the axe head texture non-symmetrical, so it looks more natural\r\n\tTweaked the heads a little\r\n\tAdded both the big head and small head axe as items in the same mod, so you don\\'t have to download 2 files\r\n\tAdded the chests, for people who can\\'t craft daedric\r\n\r\n1.0:\r\n\tFirst Skyrim release",
