Still, you should always make a backup save before installing ANY mod, in case something goes wrong.\r<br />\r<br />Have you ever been bothered by all these pots hanging over fires, but never having anything inside? Are people from Skyrim shy eaters, or did you always catch them after they had their meal? Well, this is no more&#33; \r<br />\r<br />This lightweight mod adds food to these pots, one item at a time of course, since you cannot cook two meals at the same time, can you? The foods are all cooked, and range from vegetables, to meats, soups and stews. Raw foods, and items like bread, drinks and fruit are not included. Should come in handy if you have one of those fancy hunger mods. \r<br />\r<br />This really shouldn&#39;t conflict with anything, and it requires no DLCs. Bon appetit&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Notes[/b][/u]\r<br />I originally made this mod for the Steam Workshop. Link [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=119874707]here[/url]. To install, place the files in your &#39;Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim/Data&#39; folder. Then activate the mod through your preferred launcher by ticking the checkbox next to the esp. Or use your mod manager of choice to install the mod automatically. Have fun&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/UJ12AJk.png[/img][/center]",
