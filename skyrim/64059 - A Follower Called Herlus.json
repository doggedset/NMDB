The Follower is a Imperial Called Herlus. His backstory is that when he was younger he joined the imperial legion but after he found out what the Thalmor did to his family he went berserk and left the legion to join the stormcloaks, but they denied his. With nothing left, Herlus travelled to the Windpeak inn, Dawnstar in hopes of finding the Dragonborn.   ",
