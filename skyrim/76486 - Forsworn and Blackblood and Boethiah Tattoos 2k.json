  "summary": "High Resolution texture set replacing the Forsworn male and female tattoo sets with 2k war paints, also replaces Blackblood tattoos and adds the unplayable Boethiah tattoo as a replacer for the sixth dark elf warpaint.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is simply a texture replacer mod that gives the male and female Forsworn tattoos a 2k highres version, as well as the Blackblood tattoos. I recommend the latest version of Racemenu for the best level of warpaint customization for your character, as well as the use of SKSE and adding the line &#34;iTintTextureResolution=2048&#34; under [Display] in your skse.ini\r<br />\r<br />I find that these tints are often left out of highres warpaint replacers entirely so this is my attempt at rectifying that.\r<br />\r<br />Also, since the sixth dark elf warpaint for both genders is my absolute least favorite and I&#39;ve always wanted to make the unplayable Boethiah cultist tattoo playable, I made a highres Boethiah tattoo for both genders and it replaces that sixth dark elf warpaint. An improvement, in my humble opinion.\r<br />\r<br />Please see the images I have uploaded for a good look at the new paints and feel free to upload your own if you like them&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Tools used: Paint.net",
