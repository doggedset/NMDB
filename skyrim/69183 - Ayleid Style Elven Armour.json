It uses vanilla texture paths, so any retex of Elven armour will effect this too.",
  "descriptionHtml": "(This is based on the Elven armour in Oblivion)\r<br />\r<br />Ayleid styled Elven armour.\r<br />\r<br />This is an alteration of the Elven Cuirass and Helmet (With pauldrons taken from ebony armour) to make some armour that looks like the style of armour the Ayleids used. (From the design in Oblivion)\r<br />It&#39;s just the Cuirass and Helmet. It uses vanilla texture paths, so any retex of Elven armour will effect this too. This does not replace any armour.\r<br />I made this for fun.\r<br />\r<br />By the way, you need the Elven smithing perk to make them at a forge. Use the same ingredients as the Elven armour.\r<br />\r<br />There are 2 versions of the cuirass. One with pauldrons, and another without. If anyone wants to use these for another mod, then go right ahead.",
