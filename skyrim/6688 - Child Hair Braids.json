  "descriptionHtml": "[u]Child Hair Braids[/u]\r\n\r\n- by Bethesda, and Vergis, aka VirusType2, December 25, 2011 (uploaded Jan 21, 2012)\r\n\r\n_____________________________________\r\nTHIS IS A BETA, PLEASE READ CAREFULLY\r\n_____________________________________\r\n\r\nNormally, only the redguard child has the long braided hair style, but I liked the braided hair, so I made it work with the Breton and Nord child races. This way, we can pick alternative hair and skin colors.\r\n\r\nThis will make ALL female Breton and Nord children have the braided hair style! Imperials are unchanged. This mod assumes you understand how to play as a child race, if you intend to do so. I don\\'t plan on providing support for other mods here, however you are free to comment -- ask and others may assist.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the CK, I\\'m sure it won\\'t be difficult to allow all hair types for all children, making this particular mod obsolete!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mod may have a dependency on other mods, please continue reading:\r\n\r\n[b]NOTES and ISSUES: This is a pre-CK beta, with somewhat limited testing. \r\n\r\n*******\r\nThis mod was created in December, but I had one of the braids disappear once I hit the first loading screen, and I was able to replicate this issue. \r\n\r\nToday I noticed it was working fine. Then I did some more testing, including fast travel and loading new areas, and the problem is fixed. I\\'ve even changed the character\\'s race and sex, and was able to use the braids again. Therefore, I have decided to upload the mod. \r\n\r\nI can only imagine it was fixed when I started using the \\\"new children\\\" child body mesh (which includes the head).\r\n\r\nTherefore, this mod probably has a dependency on \\\"new children\\\" body mesh replacer.\r\n\r\nI recommend the mod regardless, since it is a big improvement:\r\n\r\n \\\"new children\\\"\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6172\r\n\r\n*******[/b]\r\n\r\nBEFORE ANYONE ASKS:\r\n\r\nThe eyes for the player selectable child race have their own exclusive mesh, so replacing the color is easy and affects no other NPCs. To get red eyes like mine, well, I haven\\'t uploaded them yet. It will be available soon. In the mean-time, you can check my mod listed at the bottom of this page \\\"Child Eyes\\\", and find a different color, again, that you can change at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease comment and leave feedback.\r\n\r\n__________\r\nInstallation: Merge the data folder with Skyrim\\'s data folder.\r\n\r\nUninstall: Remove the file included with this download.\r\n\r\nBy removing this mod, your hair will default to the style originally used by that race.\r\n__________\r\n\r\n\r\nI HAVE SOME OTHER UPLOADS :D\r\n[LIST]\r\n[*]Child Eyes - Eye Colors\r\n\r\n[*]Rift Performance PLUS\r\n\r\n[*]Eye Glow Colors\r\n\r\n[*]Conjuration Sound FX\r\n\r\n[*]Catacomb Ambiance\r\n\r\n[*]Level 1 and level 49 Imperial Male gamesaves\r\n[/LIST]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=3137532]FIND THEM HERE[/url]",
