  "descriptionHtml": "Description:\r\n\r\nYou are tired of your Daedric Armor? Playing the whole time with only one armor, because it has the best stats?\r\nWell, then this is the perfect mod for you!\r\n\r\nThis mod adds \\\"Advanced Versions\\\" of all standard armors & weapons . These advanced armors/weapons use the same textures as their standard versions do, but they´ve got the stats from the Daedric Armor (Heavy) and from the Dragonscale Armor (Light) & from the Daedric Weapons.\r\nThe armors/weapons  are craftable with the \\\"Omniscient Smith Perk\\\" which needs a smithing skill of 90 and the perk \\\"Daedric Smithing\\\" or the perk \\\"Dragon Armor\\\". You also need the Smithing Perks for the standard armors/weapons , you want to craft in an advanced version.\r\nTo craft fraction related \\\"Advanced Items\\\" you a specific rank in this fraction or at least you must join them.\r\n\r\nNow with Dragonborn support, some items are still not implemented because I hadn´t time to play Dragonborn myself yet. These items will be added in the next version!\r\n\r\nThe latest versions requires the latest Skyrim version!\r\nIMPORTANT: Now with Dragonborn/Dawnguard support, scroll down to \\\"installation\\\" to see how it works :)\r\n\r\nPlease leave feedback and sorry for my english :D\r\n\r\nThis mod contains:\r\n- The \\\"Omniscient Smith\\\" Perk\r\n- The \\\"Advanced Elven Armor\\\" \r\n- The \\\"Advanced Dwemer Armor\\\"\r\n- The \\\"Advanced Falmer Armor\\\"\r\n- The \\\"Advanced Glass Armor\\\"\r\n- The \\\"Advanced Iron Armor\\\"\r\n- The \\\"Advanced Orcish Armor\\\"\r\n- The \\\"Advanced Draugr Armor\\\"\r\n- The \\\"Advanced Steel Armor\\\"\r\n- The \\\"Advanced Leather Armor\\\"\r\n- The \\\"Advanced Ebony Armor\\\"\r\n- The \\\"Advanced Hide Armor\\\"\r\n+ CHANGELOG\r\n\r\nThere is also a \\\"No-Perk Version\\\". It adds all the armors and weapons but you you need the \\\"Daedric Smithing\\\" Perk or the \\\"Dragon Armor\\\" Perk instead of the \\\"Omniscient Smith\\\" Perk to craft them.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nYou need the latest version of Skyrim installed!\r\nSimply download the version you want with the NMM and activate it. \r\nIMPORTANT: If you don´t own \\\"Dawnguard\\\" or \\\"Dragonborn\\\" disable the \\\"Omniscient Smith (Dawnguard).esp\\\"  or the \\\"Omniscient Smith (Dragonborn).esp after activating the mod.\r\nIf you´re playing with both dlc´s you don´t have to care about that!\r\n\r\nYou always can add screenshots :)\r\n\r\nPlans for the future:\r\n- german version is coming soon!",
