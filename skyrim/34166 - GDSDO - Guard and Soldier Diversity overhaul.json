  "descriptionHtml": "[B][center][COLOR=#c00000][SIZE=7][FONT=Times New Roman]Guard and soldier Diversity Overhaul[/FONT][/SIZE][/COLOR][/center][/B]\r\n\r\n[SIZE=3][center][COLOR=#c00000][FONT=Times New Roman][B]What are my Thoughts of vanilla guards[/B][/FONT][/COLOR][/center][/SIZE]\r\nWell i have played this game so many times, and oh so many more times to test this mod, before i thought there was bugs with \r\n\r\nthis mod but it was to do the old old sky-re i was using (vanilla) so i believe that this is 99% bug free.\r\nAnyhoo my thoughts;\r\n#1 The soldiers are weak.\r\n#2 a petty \\\"trained\\\" soldier facing a almost untrained dragonborn (depends on level and how long you have played the game)\r\n#3 no variation, in their faces originally there is only about 30ish facegens for all the soldiers and guards in skyrim. now there \r\n\r\nis well over 100.\r\n#4 no outfit variation.\r\n#5General Tullius had a quote that i like in game and it went like this, \r\n\\\"Battles are won by Trained and disciplined Men\\\". Now the Men in Skyrim aren\\'t disciplined or trained.. to be honest i\\'d much \r\n\r\nrather face a 9 year old playing call of duty (btw i kinda play call of duty, and battlefield)\r\n\r\n[SIZE=3][center][COLOR=#c00000][FONT=Times New Roman][B]One thing you get allot with this sort of mod is;[/B][/FONT][/COLOR][/center][/SIZE]\r\nOh my! you have mixed up the Armors, i don\\'t like that im not going to download. \r\nA: Quite frankly i don\\'t care if you don\\'t want to download it.\r\nA: They aren\\'t completely mixed up, there is still parts that makes them differ from each other. one thing i didn\\'t like was \r\n\r\nwhen you\\'s finished the Cw quest line and over half the holds had the same armor. It got really boring. a quote from the one \r\n\r\nthing in skyrim, is that the Jarl\\'s are largely independent, and when the Civil war is over it seems as if they are controlled by \r\n\r\none Empire/faction. In oblivion All the holds/major cities are governed by a count/ess. and they are apart of the empire. but \r\n\r\nnone of their uniforms match.\r\nA: The thing is also, if you have another mod that you like and you want it to change the faction armors and it uses the same \r\n\r\nthings i replaced, then you can use it, just load after this mod.\r\n\r\n[SIZE=3][B][center][COLOR=#c00000][FONT=Times New Roman]what does this do?... Well[/FONT][/COLOR][/center][/B][/SIZE]\r\n[b]*boring stuff[/b]\r\n-Guards and soldiers are now much stronger, because i wasn\\'t satisfied with how strong they were before.\r\n-There is also a .esp upgrade that has The soldiers even stronger, look in the downloads for the file.\r\n-all soldiers have new perks such as, Torch Bash, Juggernaut, Barbarian, Armsman, Overdraw, Agile Defender. These all are \r\n\r\nhigher or lower depending on the soldier or guards rank. Also the Field Mages have their own perks.\r\n-Soldier ranks are Based on strength, kinda. [COLOR=#c00000]Stormcloak Skald And Imperial Prefect are the strongest[/COLOR], there is also two other ranks.\r\n-Most if not all soldiers and guards are spawned with a potion of either healing or stamina.\r\n-Most if not all soldiers and guards are equipped with a restore stamina spell.\r\n[b]*Not so boring stuff[/b]\r\n-New weapons have a chance to spawn on guards thanks to various mod authors *noted in the perms/credits section.\r\n-New stormcloaks and Imperials cuirass/gauntlets and boots have chances to spawn on each and every soldier, and some of the \r\n\r\nitems may spawn on guard depending on where they are and who they are.\r\n-I made some of the textures mentioned above.\r\n-New guard and soldier shields, even a light one, and i believe it is blank with no logo.\r\n-Npc\\'s now have random classes, an assassin stormcloak in the field, *say what!\r\n-plus heaps more to much to mention.\r\n-Finally i have added a couple chests in helgen keep with random imperial items and stormcloak items. and you will find some \r\n\r\nother items around the keep, E.g i have changed the mage that is in the cage, and made him wear the stormcloak mage armor \r\n\r\n(his original one in in his inventory also). and there is an imperial mage outfit just around the corner in a slightly harder locked \r\n\r\ncage.\r\n\r\n[SIZE=3][center][COLOR=#c00000][FONT=Times New Roman][B]What diversity?[/FONT][/b][/COLOR][/center][/SIZE]\r\n[b]*boring stuff[/b]\r\nWell i have added more diversity To the faces of the Soldiers and guards, so if you use something like Open faced guard helms: \r\n\r\nhttp://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9514 (if used with sky-re put low in load order) you will notice the difference.\r\nWhen a hold is taken over All hold cuirass armors will Not change but the gauntlets boots and helmets will.\r\nThe soldiers and guards will not only use their light armor counterparts they will also use The heavy helmet, gauntlets and \r\n\r\nboots. Check images for More clarification.\r\n\r\nIn this mod, There is included mods That i have found available to modders for free of use, and i had asked Pvti for his \r\n\r\nImperial spear model\r\nHere is a list of links to reference them PLEASE DOWNLOAD AND ENDORSE THEM!:\r\n\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/21120]Heavy Armory By PrivateEye[/url] \r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29647]Insanity\\'s Steel Bow[/url]\r\n- [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12987]Improved Stormcloak and Imperial Uniforms by lumps[/url]\r\n- New Weapons - [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3871]New weapons[/url]\r\n- New Imperial Scout Cuirass - [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6947]Here[/url] (i changed texture)\r\n- New Stormclaok textures courtesy of - [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5136]Here[/url] \r\n(none of these mods are required to use this mod)\r\nThank you to all the mod authors for allowing me to use their models in this mod, please read perms tab for more.\r\n\r\n[SIZE=3][center][COLOR=#c00000][FONT=Times New Roman][B]Other good mods.[/B][/FONT][/COLOR][/center][/SIZE]\r\nGuard dialogue overhaul: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/23390\r\nOpen faced guard helms: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9514 (if used with sky-re put last in load order)\r\nDiverse guards: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8943 NOTE: not completely compatible with this you either choose This \r\n\r\nones face Gen or the Other ones face Gen last one in load order wins)\r\nImmersive patrols: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12977\r\nDeadly dragons: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3829\r\nT3nd0s Skyrim Redone: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9286\r\nanything that makes enemy\\'s harder.\r\n\r\n[SIZE=3][center][COLOR=#c00000][b][FONT=Times New Roman]What i have tested;[/FONT][/b][/COLOR][/center][/SIZE]\r\n[b]*boring stuff[/b]\r\nI have tested this through both sides of the Civil war, and found no Serious bugs.\r\n\r\nTHIS EDITS THE VANILLA LEVELED LISTS. THIS MOD (ONCE IT IS INSTALLED) CANNOT BE UNINSTALLED AS THE LEVELED LISTS THAT ARE CHANGED WILL AFFECT THE GAME EVEN AFTER THIS MOD IS GONE, AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY EITHER. \r\n\r\nNOTED BUGS!\r\nThe new shields that i have added have a bug when in the inventory as they have the riften sign when it should be the shields logo.\r\nThere is a imperial soldier in Winterhold that won\\'t disappear, just open up the console ( ` ) and click on him, then type disable and \\'enter\\'. then he should disappear, i will fix this later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[SIZE=3][center][COLOR=#c00000][b][FONT=Times New Roman]Install/Uninstall;[/FONT][/b][/COLOR][/center][/SIZE]\r\n[b]*boring stuff[/b]\r\nUse Nmm to install this is the best choice.\r\nOr extract the .zip contents into your Skyrim/data directory and make sure everything is in the correct folder.\r\n\r\n[b]To uninstall, use Nmm or delete the .zip contents.
