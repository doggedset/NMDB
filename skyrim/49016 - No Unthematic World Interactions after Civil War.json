  "summary": "Disables unthematic random interactions after the Civil War is ended. ",
  "descriptionHtml": "EDIT: New version uploaded that fixes first five interactions still happening. Please report if you still see them&#33; The new version checks whether stage 100 of CWFinale is finished (the event when you deal with Tullius/Ulfric when sieging their castles). \r<br />\r<br />Disables some &#34;unthematic&#34; world interactions after the Civil War is finished. \r<br />\r<br />The following random interactions are changed: \r<br />\r<br />Looking to join Imperials\r<br />Looking to join Stormcloaks\r<br />Imperials vs. Stormcloaks\r<br />Imperials with Stormcloak Prisoner (since the prisoner tells you to join Ulfric and runs to Windhelm)\r<br />Thalmor with Prisoner (for the same reason, and since it&#39;s unlikely the Thalmor would be able to openly capture people like that in independent Skyrim)\r<br />\r<br />Disabled after you complete the Civil War. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Imperial/Stormcloak Scout Patrol/On the Road\r<br />\r<br />Fire only if Tullius/Ulfric respectively are alive (meaning, as long as their GetDeadCount is 0). \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Forsworn attacking Imperial Soldiers\r<br />Bandits dressed as Imperial Soldiers (in independent Skyrim, being dressed as an Imperial Soldier shouldn&#39;t grant even the fleeting appearance of legitimacy)\r<br />Thalmor Travelling on the Road \r<br />\r<br />Fire only if Tullius is alive. \r<br />\r<br />My first TESedit tweak (calling it a mod would be overstating its scope), which I use in my own game. Likely unneeded/incompatible with major epic CW-changing mods like Civil War Overhaul.  If you find any coding flaws, let me know. ",
