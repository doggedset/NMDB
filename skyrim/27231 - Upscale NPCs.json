  "summary": "A complete overhaul of all NPCs primarily the female but inclusive of some but not all the male NPCs facial features and hair styles with 25 new Outfits introduced\r\n ",
  "descriptionHtml": "[img]http://i.imgur.com/LoUZM.jpg?2[/img]\r\n\r\nThe object was to beautify in most respects the women of Skyrim but I felt that in the cases of the extremely elderly the most I should do is make them look middle aged not ancient.\r\n In most cases the  wrinkles and scars have been removed or at the least toned down. Some of the men have been reworked as well. Most of the Villain NPC\\'s in game have been left alone excepting for some clothing swaps.\r\nThe work was designed to replace the clothing of the townspeople from the vanilla pug ugly outfits but I did retain vanilla clothes  for most of the farmers,\r\n there should be some contrast in styles. There is a distinct difference between Imperial supporters in the nobility and Stormcloak supporters. There are 25 completely new default outfits introduced in this version\r\n The rebels in the main retained much of the the vanilla Skyrim outfits with some changes.\r\n Almost all merchants in the cities are given more upscale clothing to reflect their higher status over the commoners. \r\nThis mod was throughly tested with V.1.7.7 with and without Dawnguard installed. Recently tested with V.1.8.51 with Dawnguard.\r\n**************************************************************************************************************************************\r\nV-1.0 has a total of 25 new outfits.\r\nV-2.0 Has a total of 68 new outfits.  Dawnguard and Hot Property are additional requirement to all of V-1\\'s required files. You must have Dawnguard DLC \r\n*************************************************************************************************************************************\r\nV-2.1 Update will be out before the end of the year with minor updates that will include several NPC\\'s that were bypassed in V-2 mostly farmers that the player has quest interactions with. There will be no additional required file changes between V-2 and V-2.1\r\n**************************************************************************************************************************************\r\n[Mods Required for V-1]\r\nApachi Hair v 1.3 or Higher               (author-Apachii)                      http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\r\nGizmodian Witchbane v 1.0                 (author-Gizmodian)                    http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12258\r\nCloaks of Skyrim v.09 or Higher           (author-Noodles)                      http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12092\r\nHentai Karliah Armor v 1.0                (author-Hentai)                       http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7681\r\nAshara Romantic Outfit v 5.0              (author-SydneyB)                      http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5577\r\n(Standalone version v50 for UNP and FavoredSoul)\r\n**************************************************************************************************************************************\r\n[Mods Required for V-2]\r\nDLC Dawnguard                             (author-Bethsada)                     Steam\r\nApachi Hair v 1.4                         (author-Apachii)                      http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168\r\nGizmodian Witchbane v 1.0                 (author-Gizmodian)                    http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12258\r\nCloaks of Skyrim v.09 or Higher           (author-Noodles)                      http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12092\r\nHentai Karliah Armor v 1.0                (author-Hentai)                       http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/7681\r\nAshara Romantic Outfit v 5.0              (author-SydneyB)                      http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5577\r\n(Standalone version v50 for UNP)\r\nHot Property (Main File)                  (author-YamiElisa)                    http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/22812\r\n**************************************************************************************************************************************\r\n[Recommended Optional Mods]\r\n Ashara Romantic Outfit Royal Retexture by Messias Muummo**Highly Recomended**   http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15855\r\nReapers Necromancer Runes Robe ***by Reaper911          **Highly Recomended**   http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5875\r\nPhoenix Design - Expert Robes Replacer Female by gekks  **Highly Recomended**   http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3622\r\nCoverwomen v 2.1 by mrLenski                                                    http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/3563\r\nCovereyes v 1.0  by mrLenski                                                    http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4869\r\nBetter Females by Bella v 3.0 by BellaGail                                      http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2812\r\nStraight hair retexture v 1.2 by navetsea                                       http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4333\r\n                                 \r\nI would like to thank Apachii, Gizmodian, Noodles, Hentai, Sydney B, YamiElisa and JeremeW5257 without their very gracious permission none of this would have ever been able to be shared.\r\nThe above authors are the original mod genius\\'s and I take no credit for their work what so ever.

Any NPC that was modded in this mod will have an  *  in the Count column.\r\n\r\n3) If you want to export all the face gen data of every modded npc then hold down ctrl as you proceed through the selection process.\r\n\r\n3) When all relevant NPC\\'s are selected Press Ctrl and F4 simultaneously. A pop up window will appear asking if you want to export Face gen data, click yes.\r\n\r\n4) If you are going to select all the npc\\'s to export face gen data it will take a few minutes for the CK to process them all, you will notice the names in question at the bottom of CK as it processes them all.\r\n\r\n5)Answer yes to all warnings, when the windows pops up with a done response then click ok. Look at the top left of the CK toolbar and  click the save function it looks like an old 3.5 disk (it\\'s the second from the left). You are done.\r\n************************************************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\n\r\n",
