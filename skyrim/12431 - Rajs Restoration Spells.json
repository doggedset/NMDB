This includes all of the old Fortify, Resist, and Cure abilities from Morrowind and Oblivion, as well as fourteen new Master level spells. The Lite and Mastery versions are compatible with one another. [/size][/color][/center]\r\n\r\n[size=3][b][u]Information[/u][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nFind the Kahjiit named Raj or his twin brother Rai hiding behind the Bannered Mare in Whiterun to buy these exotic Spelltomes from the far away lands of Morrowind and Cyrodiil.\r\n\r\nThese spells have been balanced into the game by price, mana cost, skill level, and power to the best of my ability. \r\n\r\nThe Raj\\'s Restoration 100 version of this mod offers players one-hundred Restoration spells. There are \\\"Lesser\\\"(Apprentice), regular (Adept) and \\\"Greater\\\"(Expert) versions of each of the Fortify and Resist spells. As well as Cure Poison, Cure Disease, three versions of a heal over time spell called Rejuvenation and fourteen new custom spells in the style of the Restoration School.\r\n\r\nThe Raj\\'s Restoration Lite version of this mod offers players thirty essential Restoration spells. There is one version of each of the Fortify and Resist Spells equal to the \\\"Greater\\\"(Expert) spells in the \\\"100\\\" version. As well as Cure Poison and Cure Disease. \r\n\r\nThe Raj\\'s Restoration Mastery version of this mod offers players only the fourteen custom Master level Restoration spells from the \\\"100\\\" version and the \\\"Greater\\\" version of the heal over time spell. \r\n\r\nThere is also another optional file filled with spells for testing purposes. Find the \\\"Test Chest\\\" behind the Bannered Mare in Whiterun. Try them out and let me know your thoughts about them on the comments page. Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nThe spells provided are listed below with a short description.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][b][u]Aprrentice Level Spells (100 Version)[/u][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nLesser Fortify Health

not the player\\'s perk apply to the spells.\r\n\r\n[u]Other Notes[/u]\r\nNo longer supported. I do not plan to purchase Hearthfire due to a personal distaste for the product and so cannot mod with the new content. This mod should still work with unexpanded Skyrim (and Dawnguard if noted as such). Sorry for any inconvenience but with this game being almost a year old I feel it\\'s time to move on to newer modding horizons. Thank you to everyone who downloaded and enjoyed my Skyrim mods. I hope to see you all again in other mod workshops. Best wishes!",
