  "descriptionHtml": "---*Lore*---\r\n\r\n There was a beauty pageant to be held in Whiterun. On the way, the escort of some attractive contestants was plucked from his carriage by a Dragon. Warmed by a barrel of Nordic Mead, the girls had been dancing nude in the back of the wagon before the attack. Afterwards they rushed, tripped, and giggled their way to the nearest town, Riverwood. These ladies are waiting at the Sleeping Giant Inn, and the owner is rather suspiciously having a \\\"hard\\\" time finding them something to wear. \r\n\r\n---*Requirements*---\r\n\r\n1. [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10168]ApachiiSkyHair[/url] with Vanilla Colors\r\n2. [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=2666]CalientesBBE v3[/url] [u][b]Important[/b][/u]: When asked to \\\"Install Default Facial Textures\\\" say [u]No[/u]. If asked to overwrite .nif files, say [u]Yes[/u].\r\nor [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6709]Dimonized UNP[/url] If you prefer UNP. Do not install both body replacers.\r\n3. [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7897]envision Face[/url] (Large lips for CBBE) or If you prefer UNP body replacer, use (Large lips for UNP). Do not install both face files.\r\n\r\n---*Recommended*--- \r\n\r\nThese are not essential. \r\n\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=14228]Big Dialogue Overhaul[/url] -I highly recommend this mod for a better follower experience. \r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=8684]Orlongs Hearth[/url] -And this mod for a truly nice home to share with them. (Seen in screenshots)\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=16028]Rayeks End[/url] -Perfect man cave to get away from the women or... to drag one to. (Seen in screenshots)\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11954]Pretty Female Idle[/url] -This mod makes women more feminine. (Seen in screenshots)\r\n\r\n---*Clothing from Screenshots*---\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13004]Remodeled Armor CBBE[/url] \r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=3654]Killer Keos Skimpy CBBE[/url]\r\n\r\n---*Additional Comments*---\r\nThey scale to your level and while good with bows, they can be killed by the player. They prefer to relax somewhere safe and warm, and be given lots of clothes to try on. \r\n\r\n---*Credit*---\r\nJust watched a [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzVIcnfvePw]Tutorial on YouTube[/url] and made these companions in-game using sliders. Some were simply presets that I messed with and others more or less from scratch. That said, the appearances displayed are in no way shape or form the results of my \\\"hard work\\\" and I\\'m happy to give credit to all the talented modders who spared many hours to provide such impressive resources for us to indulge in and make Skyrim more awesome. \r\n\r\nThanks to apachii, RAN46, dd2501, Caliente, dimon99, Boris Vorontsov, sharpshooter8, pikkatze, dualsun, Utopolyst, cire992, killerkeo, MAK07, Rayek, Bethesda and the Nexus Community in general.",
