I appreciate any and all constructive criticism.  I know there\\'s some spots I messed up, some spots that have too much red, different shades of red, so on but I said already I\\'m new to this =P.  If people end up liking the this I\\'ll go ahead and redo it and take more time on it and probably do the scabbard as well.  Enjoy.\r\n\r\n*Update*  Decided to do the scabbard now anyways just because it didn\\'t look right without it.  \r\n\r\n**Be warned...this will replace the default colors for any ebony weapon that uses a scabbard.**",
