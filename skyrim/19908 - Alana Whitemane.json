  "descriptionHtml": "She was my first character on Skyrim, and during the Companions I think it was a good idea to give  Kodlak  a daughter, maybe he was upset because she turn to the lycanthropes and that its why he don’t talk about her!!!  You know (parental care and family conflict).  \r\nShe has a destruction mage combat ability, but I give her the wolf armor and an enchanted sword, that I hope she use… you can find her in Jorrvaskr hall.\r\nShe has some Companions AI. I think she needs to sleep on one of the principal rooms but I can’t or I don’t know how to do it. I think that maybe relocating Varkas to move with Vilkas can work; you know they are after all brothers… But if you want to edit her in any wais to improve the companions experience you can do it, and please share it. \r\n",
