  "descriptionHtml": "There are a plethora of unarmed mods out there. None of them really jived with me, so I decided to create my own with the CK with a bit of a twist.\r<br />\r<br />**Note**\r<br />This mod, along with many other unarmed mods, require an unarmed &#34;weapon&#34; be equipped in order for many perks and skill-ups to trigger. This one is no different. It&#39;s the best I can do, but at least the weapons are weightless and cannot be disarmed. \r<br />\r<br />As such, it is recommended you use SkyUI with this mod, as it makes for easier equipping of unarmed weapons.\r<br />\r<br />[b]**UPDATE v0.3**[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Unarmed Fighting Styles are now automatically added to the player&#39;s inventory (thanks to egocarib for showing me how)&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Unarmed Fighting Styles are now set to not be sell-able so you cannot accidentally sell them. That, and they now have no monetary value. \r<br />\r<br />Did more tweaking with the base damage, as setting it too low made it much more tedious to level up...trying to find a happy medium. \r<br />\r<br />[b]**UPDATE v0.2**[/b]\r<br />\r<br />I reduced the base damage of the unarmed styles as it has the possibility to become very overpowered, especially if you are playing a Khajiit or even Argonian. Styles can still be improved at a workbench or enchanted if you want to increase their power (seeing as how they are still technically weapons)\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Introduction[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Unarmed takes on a life of it&#39;s own with this mod. Not only will you be able to fight with your bare fists and level your one-handed skills, but you&#39;ll also be able to choose your own fighting style or mix and match them to customize your moves to any given situation.\r<br />\r<br />I made this mod for myself, but since I was having fun with it, I figured I&#39;d share it on the Nexus.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Description[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />This mod adds three unarmed fighting styles to the game. They are based on the One-handed perks that go along with the different weapon types. All three are based on the base damage of an iron dagger (4 damage), and each style offers their own base benefits. You can double up a single fighting style or mix and match styles (dual wielding)\r<br />\r<br />To add the item(s) to your inventory, open the Console (~) and type &#34;help unarmed&#34;. You should then see Unarmed (Critical Strike), Unarmed (Savage Strike) and Unarmed (Piercing Strike). Type &#34;player.additem [item code] n&#34; (n being the number of said item. The codes are given below, with &#39;xx&#39; representing your specific load order. [b]**THIS SHOULD NO LONGER BE NECESSARY AS ITEMS SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE PLAYERS INVENTORY AUTOMATICALLY UPON LOADING A SAVEGAME**[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Critical Strike (xx0012cb):\r<br />\r<br />The Unarmed Critical Strike Style adds devastating critical attacks once the Bladesman Perks are chosen. The base damage is 4, but instead of 2 critical damage, it is increased to 8 to make the perks worth it. Unarmed attacks with the Critical Strike style stagger as if attacking with a sword. \r<br />\r<br />Savage Strike (xx0012cc):\r<br />\r<br />The Unarmed Savage Strike Style adds bleed damage to attacks once the Hack and Slash Perks are chosen. In order to show the true savagery of these attacks, the bleed damage is based on Daedric weapons (since bleed damage is based on weapon material), giving total bleed damage of 12/14/18 corresponding to each H&S perk.\r<br />\r<br />Piercing Strike (xx0012ca):\r<br />\r<br />As with maces, attacks with the Piercing Strike Style ignore a percentage of armor once the Bone Breaker perks are taken. In addition, Piercing Strike attacks have a higher chance to stagger with power attacks, similar to those with maces. \r<br />\r<br />[b][u]Installation[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />Simply place the [i]Unarmed Fighting Styles.esp[/i] in your Game/Data directory, or use the Nexus Mod Manager. Don&#39;t forget to activate the mod&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Notes[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />1. Argonian and Khajiit unarmed damage bonuses DO still apply\r<br />2. Damage added by Fists of Steel should still apply\r<br />3. Fighting styles [i]may not[/i] &#34;unequip&#34; during brawls, but they should\r<br />4. All critical attacks do 4 extra damage (3 base damage), instead of just 50% more\r<br />5. Fighting Styles can be &#34;improved&#34; via grinding stone if you want some extra oomph.\r<br />6. They can be enchanted, as well.\r<br />7. Dual wielding perks DO work with individual fighting styles.\r<br />8. Increase Unarmed Damage enchantments DO work with the unarmed fighting styles.\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Recommended Mods[/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9421/?]Martial Arts[/url] - This adds a more dynamic unarmed fighting experience.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863/?]SkyUI[/url] - this allows for easy style combinations and switching between styles with the Group Favorites menu\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Future Releases[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />I may add attack/hit sounds to go along with each fighting style, such as a warhammer sound for Piercing Strike to represent the armor bypass...or something long those lines.\r<br />\r<br />---------------------------------------\r<br />\r<br />This mod is still a work in progress. I&#39;m testing it was a khajiit brawler character. Everything seems to be working so far, but please let me know if you run into any issues.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />",
