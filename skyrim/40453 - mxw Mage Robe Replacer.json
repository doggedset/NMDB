  "descriptionHtml": "Built on CBBE CT77 preset from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25259/?]Remodeled Armor for CBBE Bodyslide and BBP.[/url] Uses the underwear from there too.\r\n\r\nTextures in the screenshot are from [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35002/?]Opulent Outfits[/url] and are highly recommended. Note that the hoods added by Opulent Outfits are buggy for beast races; the Armor Addon\\'s texture sets for them are wrong. You can fix it in TES5Edit with a little copy/pasting.\r\n\r\nv2: Now supports Bodyslide and includes panty texture.\r\nv2.1: Forgot to set the mesh to double sided while making Bodyslide support. Fixes being able to see through the robes from different angles. \r\nv2.2: Briefly had the wrong files uploaded.",
