Because I like to see my character with the body I installed from character creation onward and I need the practice.\r<br />\r<br />I had an optional file with other armors but I took it down because they were not complete.\r<br /> [color=#FF0000]I&#39;ve removed the &#34;Optional File&#34; for now because I&#39;d like to possibly finish it and re-upload it here or in another file.[/color] This is my first time uploading a mod and I am new to armor conversions so any tips, tricks, hints, criticisms, or suggestions are more than welcome. \r<br />\r<br />[color=#FFFF00][b]Included in these files:[/b][/color]  Only Body / Cuirass meshes \r<br />Prisoner Clothes (Main file)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#33CC00][i]Weight Slider compatible.
