  "descriptionHtml": "This is my first mod!  \r\n\r\n\r\n>FEATURES<\r\n>>Recolor of the vanilla elven armor\r\n>>Fully craftable and improvable- slightly edited recipe materials, includes a little malachite\r\n>>Standalone set (does NOT replace the regular elven armor set)\r\n>>Heavy type (including shield) and modified stats to match a heavy set\r\n********The armor rating is about in between daedric and dragonplate\r\n>>Both male and female\r\n>>Works with CBBE\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE let me know if you have any issues with the file, I\\'d be happy to update it.  Read below for instructions on installation.  For beginners (or anyone, I use it myself) I highly recommend the Nexus Mod Manager.  Very convenient and it\\'ll get all your files installed in the right place.  \r\n\r\n\r\n>>Installation>>\r\nI recommend the mod manager download, but if you want to do it manually...\r\n1.   Place the \\'.esp\\' file in your C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data (or wherever you have skyrim installed) \r\n2.   Place the meshes and textures folders in the Data file (MERGE with currently existing folders), this should place the textures/meshes in Data/meshes/armor/elvenrune/...\r\n\r\n\r\n>>Uninstall<< \r\n1.  Remove the same files above!  (folders labeled elvenrune in both meshes and textures, and delete the .esp)\r\n\r\n\r\nMade using NifScope, Photoshop, Skyedit and CK files.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks:\r\nBethesda for game and CK\r\nLateraliss for tutorial on standalone armor",
