  "descriptionHtml": "[center][IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img13/736/nxtm.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\n[B]All of the followers will be naked when first put in game!!! For Freyja, if you have the gear mods, just recruit her and she will eqiup the gold-chain nocturnal robe. For both Odins and Thor, you must trade the armor to them![/B]\r\n\r\nNOTE TO MODDERS: \r\nI don\\'t have permission to use any of your mods, but considering downloaders MUST download your mods for them to show up in my mod, I consider it free advertising, not re-distributing. I hope you all feel the same way.\r\n\r\nNOTE TO DOWNLOADERS:\r\nOnly the pictures that I have uploaded with RED WRITTING on them is how these followers look in-game. The ones without red writing that I have uploaded show what I wanted the followers to look like. However, for some reason Creation Kit would NOT save Freyja\\'s makeup, and I could not get Valfar\\'s beard to work in CK at all.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img833/2217/54f7.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nHere are 4 followers who will follow you and protect you. Inspired and based on the Norse Gods in Norse Paganism (modern day Odinism). \r\n\r\nOdin. The Valfather. The Chief deity. The Terror of the Gods. The Troll Slayer!!! Odin is the god of war, wisdom, fury, battle, victory and death. He is the father of Thor and the leader of the Norse Gods. In this mod I have made 2 versions of Odin. A melee version (Odin Trollslayer) and a wanderer version (Odin Valfather). The Warrior uses melee and the wanderer uses magic. Odin is NOT a potential spouse.\r\n\r\nThor. The son of Odin. He is a god associated with thunder, lightning, storms, oak trees, strength, the protection of mankind, hallowing, healing and fertility. He is not as strong as Odin, but will protect you with all of his might. Thor IS marriageable.\r\n\r\nFreyja. the fairest of all the goddesses. She is associated with love, sexuality, beauty, fertility, gold, war and death. She will follow and protect you with all of her power. She is a magic class, but has the stats to efficently use any weapon!\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img534/66/2evu.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nNot all of these files are actual requirements, but to get the followers to look how they do in the screenshots, you must get all of these mods.\r\n\r\nOdin Trollslayer:\r\nRequired:\r\nApachiiSkyHair - Male Hair: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168/?\r\n\r\nGear he is wearing in Screenshots:\r\nTrollsbane armor: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/35793/?\r\nBandits Eyepatch: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1874//?\r\nRoyal Crown 2: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34209/?\r\n\r\nAlso with the warrior version of Odin, if you want to get more into the roleplay aspect of Odin, the JaysusSwords mod adds Gungnir (a sword made from the tip of Odin\\'s spear). That can be found here: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1002/?\r\n\r\nOdin Valfather:\r\nRequired:\r\nApachiiSkyHair - Male Hair: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168/?\r\n\r\nGear he is wearing in screenshots:\r\nBandits Eyepatch: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1874//?\r\nGandalf Hat - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/4198//?\r\nGandalf Hat Non-replacer version (Adds Gandalf Follower) - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/28432//?\r\nCraftable Greybeard Robes - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11524/?\r\n\r\nThe Gandalf hat will replace Jester hat in-game. However, the Gandalf follower mod will add a standalone version, but also a Gandalf follower in the mage college.\r\n\r\nFreyja:\r\nI\\'m not 100% sure if these are required, being new to making follower mods. I personally use the Diamonized UNP body + UNP Blessed Body. I\\'m not sure if both of those are required or not, but I\\'m putting them under the required section.\r\n\r\nRequired:\r\nDiamonized UNP body: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709/?\r\nUNP Blessed Body: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=37900\r\nApachii hair: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/10168/?\r\n\r\nGear she is wearing in screenshots:\r\nNocturnal Dresscode- Gold: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8042//?\r\nBuyable Nocturnal Clothing - Keyed to Wearable: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8229//?\r\n\r\nThor:\r\nRequired:\r\nNone! He is made from pure vanilla!\r\n\r\nGear is he wearing in screenshots:\r\nHeart of Thunder Asgard Edition: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/25709//?\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img443/4866/n1ug.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nAll 4 followers are level 120, but have different stats. On a fresh game they will be over-powered, but at level 81 they won\\'t be, however they are gods, so they SHOULD be over-powered.\r\n\r\nOdin Troll Slayer:\r\nlevel 100 one-handed\r\n100 two-handed\r\n100 heavy armor\r\n100 smithing\r\n100 archery\r\n100 block\r\nAll Other skills are minimal\r\n\r\nOdin Valfather:\r\n100 alchemy\r\n100 speech\r\n100 alteration\r\n100 conjuration\r\n100 destruction\r\n100 illusion\r\n100 restoration\r\n100 enchanting\r\nAll other skills are minimal\r\n\r\nThor:\r\n100 one-handed\r\n100 block\r\n100 heavy armor\r\n100 light armor\r\n100 speech\r\nAll other skills are minimal\r\n\r\nFreyja has healing spells, but I do not have the knowledge to script her to use them. If anyone here knows how and wishes to do so, go ahead. I\\'ll upload the scripted version and give you credit. She has stats in almost every skill to makeup for her lack of spells.\r\n\r\nFreyja:\r\n100 one-handed\r\n100 two-handed\r\n100 block\r\n100 heavy armor\r\n100 light armor\r\n100 speech\r\n95 alteration\r\n85 conjuration\r\n90 destruction\r\n85 illusion\r\n100 restoration\r\n85 enchanting\r\nAll other skills are minimal\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://img856.imageshack.us/img856/9408/8prz.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nIf Freyja equips the normal black Nocturnal\\'s robe, you did NOT download the gold chain replacer. (Link found in requirements section)\r\n\r\nIf Freyja doesn\\'t equip ANYTHING, you did not download the buyable/wearable Nocturnal robes mod. (also found in requirements section)\r\n\r\nOdin Valfather seems to not equip his staff. Try taking it away, then giving it back to him to fix it. I have not tried doing this, and thus do not know if it\\'ll make him use it. If not, he always has icespells at his disposal. He can use all ice spells from Novice - Master.\r\n\r\n[center][IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img42/6862/mzul.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\nV0.3 Nexus Release (Freyja Only)\r\nV0.4 Added Odin(warrior version), fixed a texture folder with Freyja\r\nV0.5 No changes to existing files. Added Odin (Wanderer Version)\r\nV0.6 No changes to existing files. Added Odin (Wanderer Version), Thor and All In One\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://imageshack.us/a/img30/647/adl9.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nBethesda for creating Skyrim & the Creation Kit\r\nApachii for creating ApachiiSkyHair\r\nMrLenski for creating Nocturnal Dresscode\r\naloneinshadow for creating the buyable/wearable Nocturnal clothing mod\r\nCeekay9 for creating the bandits eyepatch\r\nhothtropper44 for creating the Trollsbane Armor & Weapon\r\ncyric79 for creating the royal crown\r\nDigitalLion for creating the Gandalf Hat\r\nscotaiel for creating the Non-replacer Gandalf Hat\r\nKillweSnowmanX for creating craftable Greybeard Robes\r\nOminousVoice for creating Thor\\'s armor and weapon\r\nThe Gods for giving inspiration to put them into games.\r\nAnd anyone else who I haven\\'t mentioned!
