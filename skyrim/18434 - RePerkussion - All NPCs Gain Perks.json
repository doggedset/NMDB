  "modName": "RePerkussion - All NPCs Gain Perks",
  "summary": "Level the playing field and gain a whole new tactical challenge as you face off against enemies with just as many perks as you have! As the player levels up new enemies will have more and more perks according to their class.",
  "descriptionHtml": "What this mod does is the following:\r\n\r\nBy opening the .jar file located in the folder inside of the skyproc patchers folder, a patcher is generated that iterates through every NPC in the game other than the player. To each of these it adds all the perks, but each perk is conditioned in such a way that it only works for NPCs that specialize in the associated skill and have enough skill ranks. In this way a bandit mage will have different perks perhaps than a thalmor mage, and much different than a two-weapon rogue.\r\n\r\nSimply put this patcher at the bottom of your load order and you should be good to go. If you have problems, you may want to look through the FAQ for PISA (Pluto\\'s Enhanced Skyrim Experience) for help. I\\'ll try to help if I can, but I\\'m not as knowledgeable about skyproc as Pluto is.\r\n\r\nNPCs do not gain certain perks that would have made the game entirely too difficult. For example, they do not have any of the instant kill perks like Headsman, Disintegrate, etc. They also don\\'t have Impact, because that perk is broken enough with one person using it. Imagin going against three mages that can all stun you constantly. Eeps.\r\n\r\nOther than that, you should have a much enhanced tactical experience.\r\n\r\nIf you are getting errors from the .jar file, please send me a message with the contents of your debug log, and as much information as possible about your mod load order.\r\n\r\nNOTE: If you really want to continue at high levels of play, it might be advisable to get a multiple companion mod. Companions (if you have a mod that makes them level up with you, something that is broken in vanilla skyrim) will gain perks as you level just the same as any other NPC, making them a much more interesting lot as well.\r\n\r\nCurrent Bugs/Problems:\r\nAll bugs that have been discussed thus far have been resolved as of the third release.\r\nHowever, it is still wise to back up your save files.\r\nEndorsements:\r\n\r\nleonfenten\r\nMakes Skyrim Harder, Check.\r\nMakes for more varied and tactical combat, Check.\r\nImplements something that *Should* have been done in the first place, CHECK.\r\nAuto Endorse == True",
