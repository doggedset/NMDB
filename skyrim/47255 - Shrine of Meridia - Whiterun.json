  "descriptionHtml": "Hey guys this is my first mod and I hope you like it. \r\nThis mod replaces the ordinary Shrine of Talos in Whiterun with a new Shrine of Meridia. It adds a new blessing - Blessing of Meridia, which increases your magicka with 30 points. The mod also makes Heimskr a normal citizen and he will no longer go to the shrine and he will not have the ordinary dialogue about Talos. He will most likely reside in his home.\r\n\r\nInstallation: Unzip the archive in the Skyrim/Data folder and make sure you turn the mod on when starting Skyrim from the Data files menu.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me if there are any problems or bugs with the mod and I will try to fix them.",
