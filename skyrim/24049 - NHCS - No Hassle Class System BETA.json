  "summary": "A no hassle higly compatible class system.",
  "descriptionHtml": "WARNING!!- This class system requiers Elys\\' community uncaper. This is just a modefied .ini file so you must have the community uncapper instaled in order for these classes to work. You must also start a new character.\r\nDownload community uncapper from here - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/1175\r\n\r\nCONCEPT\r\nThis is a community uncapper .ini tweek that tries to rectefy the leveling system from Skyrim. \r\n\r\nYou will have class specific skills that you will be able to level up higher than none class skills. for example, the sowrd and board warrior will be able to level up his block to skill level 100 but his sneak will only go up to 25.\r\n\r\nThe player will be able to level up to lv 81 even with less skills reaching 100 levels. Skills will level a lot slower than in vanila though to compencate. The player will level skills at an even slower rate past character level 40. Skills will contribute to player level at a normal rate up to character level 40. After level 40, skills will contribute to player level at an extreamly fast rate compared to vanila. \r\n\r\nI am curently planing various other classes. You can specialize the warrior or the upcoming rogue to be archers during the game. No tweeking necesary.\r\n\r\nINSTALATION\r\nUse NMM and click on the green \\\"download with manager\\\" button. Go to skyrim\\\\Data\\\\SKSE\\\\Plugins and you should find a new folder named \\\"classes\\\" go inside the folder, pick a class, copy the .ini file, go back to the plugins folder and paste. You will have to do this every time you play a different character with a different class.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CLASSES \r\nRogue illusionist \r\nDestruction mage (released but untested)\r\nSummoner \r\nPaladin \r\nRogue \r\nCleric (2 styles, armor wearing and cloth wearing) \r\nBarbarian (released but untested)\r\n \r\nCURRENT CLASSES \r\nWarrior - Sword n board\r\nWarrior - 2handed\r\nBarbarian (untested)\r\nDestruction mage (untested)\r\n \r\nWARNING!!!! \r\nThis is only a beta. The skill progression is supposed to work well in theory, but I might have not taken some variables into consideration. play at your own risk. \r\nplayers should know that because there will be less skills, the skills will level up a lot slower than in vanilla. this is not a bug. \r\n \r\nHONORABLE MENTIONS \r\nElys for making the most awesome community uncapper. \r\nRavage for helping me with some of the math and for helping me with writing the mod description \r\nBethesda for making a great game and letting us mod the **** out of it :)\r\n\r\nPATCH NOTES\r\n\r\n0.51- Added three new classes. Barbarian, Warrior - 2handed and destruction mage.  \r\n0.5-   first release with class \\\"Warrior - Sword n board\\\"\r\n",
