  "descriptionHtml": "Hi guys. I have been getting a lot of complains that the skuldafn serie armors did not work on some computers. And in that time my skyrim crashed and there was nothing I could do, not really a beautifull combination. And its still not very well repaired, thats why I have no pics of the armors and weapon. I have this pic picked of google, so whoever knows who this pic belong to, give him my regards and thanks.\r\n\r\nThe Skuldafn Armor Pack exist out of four armors. Can all be crafted with the daedric smithing perk. I you want to know how they look like. There are on nexus but full of problems. I hope I can solve most problems like invisibilty with this Pack.\r\nThe four armors are:\r\n1. Skuldafn Armor\r\n2. Skuldafn Messenger\r\n3. Skuldafn Mage\r\n4. Skuldafn Elder Mage\r\n\r\nAnd the new weapon:\r\nSorrow Bringer\r\n\r\nAll of them are mesh ups, so know what to expect. And if you don\\'t like it, don\\'t play. So don\\'t go and complain at the comments.\r\n\r\nAnd if everybody like them so much, and I\\'ll get above 20 endorsmends (Indeed I don\\'t know how to typ it) I will make a new armor for the Skuldafn Armor Pack.\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n1. Download it\r\n2. Unrar/Unzip it, you will see a SkuldafnArmorPack.esp and a SkuldafnArmorPack.bsa\r\n3. Put these two to the Data map of Skyrim\r\n4. Make sure to select it in the Data Files of SkyrimLauncher.exe\r\n5. Happy Fighting\r\n\r\nUnistall:\r\n1. Get rid of the SkuldafnArmorPack.esp and SkuldafnArmorPack.bsa\r\n2. Done!\r\n\r\nProblems:\r\nIf getting any problems make sure to message me and not leave your problem at the comments.\r\n\r\nPic. and Video\\'s:\r\nVideo\\'s and pictures are always welcome! I hope that you guys can make some screenshots of the armor and all! I would very appreciate it!",
