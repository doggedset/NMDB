  "descriptionHtml": "So this is a series that I started making, it\\'s a story about a wood elf hunter who is hunting with his friend Faendal. In this episode they come across bandits and a mage who seems to be doing some sort of dark ritual.\r\n\r\nThis is still a work in progress episode, I\\'m thinking of adding voice acting and some dialogues. However, I can\\'t voice them all by myself so if anyone would be interested in doing some voice acting, send me a pm.\r\n\r\n[youtube]dsKa1H5ZW9Y[/youtube]",
