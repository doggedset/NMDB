  "descriptionHtml": "After seeing a very limited selection of Nightingale shield mods on nexus i thought i would throw one of my own designs up there. This Object is **NOT** UV mapped Or textured and will be required to be UV mapped and textured in order to be usable in game. This is a 100% custom mesh and does not use any resources from the game. \r\n\r\nlet me know what you think, if you like it please endorse :). Anyone who makes this into a proper mod please send me a link.\r\n\r\nUpdate 11/9/2013 a modder on the steam workshop who goes by the name of Vorn has turned my mesh into a proper working mod. I stumbeled across it and will gladly put the link up here :).\r\n\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=193360700&searchtext=\r\n\r\nCredit to Bethesda for the Nightingale insignia, i only take credit for turning it into a 3d Model.",
