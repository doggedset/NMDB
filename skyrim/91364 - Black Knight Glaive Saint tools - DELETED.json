  "descriptionHtml": "Xerperious is the creator of this mod. He has given me permission to upload his amazing weapon mod, heavily based on Dark Souls Black knight Halberd.\n<br />\n<br />I take zero credit for this. I am just lucky to have permission to share it, because otherwise he probably would not have.\n<br />\n<br />It is rather disappointing for many authors to share their work and then recieve no kind of thanks at all, so please go say thanks and maybe try out his other mods. Like his DS3 thrall axe found here\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/90471\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Included is an optional black and silver version of the weapon. Since they both use the same esp, just choose one.\n<br />This is classified as a battle axe so will use the 2hand axe movements. I suggest mods, Bethesda employees have clearly never swung around any form of bladed object.\n<br />\n<br />EDIT: indeed, this polearm is closer to the family of European glaives than I thought. Less Chinese influence than I originally guessed.\n<br />Thanks to ObsidianShade for pointing this out.\n<br />\n<br />How to acquire it? I... actually don't know. I always use Additemmenu mod anymore, so i don't know if you can type \"Help Halberd\". I just suggest you have additemmenu mod, because why wouldn't you? Find it here.\n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64905\n<br />\n<br />I am running out of beautiful white haired ladies to feature for my header. I am soon going to have to dip into my 2B cosplays. Someone help me find more pictures! F-f-f-FASHION!",
