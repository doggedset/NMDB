  "summary": "Adds two followers who reside within the inn within Riverwood.",
  "descriptionHtml": "This is a simple enough mod still in its Alpha Stages. Mainly made it for Otter and myself.  I essentially wanted some useful followers and got off my lazy arse to make them myself. For anyone else this just adds a couple new followers that lounge around in the Sleeping Giant inn. At lower level they are pretty powerful, no testing thus far at higher levels.\r\n\r\nThe Argonian is Deersh Maskil, who is skilled at heavy armor, block and one-handed weapons.\r\nWARNING: This lizard breathes fire, its unwise to stand in-between him and his enemies.\r\nAlso, Otter has recommended that nobody under level 10 uses him, or anyone under 150 health.\r\nWorking on fixing this on him.\r\n\r\nThe Dunmer is Snecoa, who is skilled with bows, light armor, and sneaking.\r\nMore followers to come.\r\n\r\nI would recommend for people to use this mod in junction with the Ultimate Followers Overhaul (UFO) Mod.\r\n\r\nComments and input are appreciated.",
