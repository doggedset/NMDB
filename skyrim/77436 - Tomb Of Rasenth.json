  "descriptionHtml": "[size=5]Work In Progress.[/size]\r<br />[size=4]\r<br />I made a ton of changes but the files ended up getting deleted :( so that made me stop modding for a long time.  I will not abandon this mod not until it is complete may take a while though.\r<br />[/size]\r<br />When I had first started the mod I had zero experience and I ended up deleting a static object (NorBgRmStairsL01 or something like that) but I re-added 71 references but there were I think 74 references so just watch your step and please tell me if you find where the stairs should be.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />My first mod.  Posts/messages are welcome as well as any criticism.\r<br />\r<br />This Largish dungeon that isn&#39;t done is really only uploaded for my friends to be able to download but if you want to download it go ahead.  I will be re-uploading it when I add stuff to it/when I finish it.\r<br />\r<br />The center on cell(COC) command for the dungeon is COC TombOfRasenth (outside) and COC TombOfRasenthinterior01 (inside)\r<br />\r<br />The dungeon is located just a little south of Halted Stream Camp.[size=4]\r<br />\r<br />Install instructions:\r<br />[/size]\r<br />Download with manager\r<br />or \r<br />Download, extract, and place files/folders in Skyrim&#39;s data folder.\r<br />\r<br />Thank you for checking out my first mod I hope you enjoy it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Credits:\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/258945]InsanitySorrow[/url]  The model I used was from this mod --&gt; http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32930/?[/size]",
