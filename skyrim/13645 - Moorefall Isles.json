So if anyone is willing to do that, or show me how to do it I would be grateful.\r\n\r\nTo get to the Island you must:\r\ngo to the solitude docks\r\nhead toward the light house\r\non your way there there you should see a single ship with a little dock next to it.\r\nOR\r\ntype in coc cityint1 exit the house and you will be on the island.\r\n\r\n============================================================================\r\nVersion 1\r\nThis is just for you to get a feel for what this mod is going to be. \r\n\r\n============================================================================\r\nVersion 2\r\nFinished exterior of the Arena.\r\nAdded a few more house interiors.\r\nAdded a small arena with two trolls(4000 hp each) for testing overpowered weapons.\r\n============================================================================\r\n\r\nI will make interiors for all of the building eventually.\r\nAny ideas for an Island name would be helpfull as I do not plan to just keep the name as \\\"The Island\\\" forever.",
