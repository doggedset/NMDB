  "descriptionHtml": "[img]https://i.imgur.com/M9wW6FN.png[/img][center][b][color=#9fc5e8]Wayshrines – Remnants of a Forgotten Era[/color][/b] is a simple plugin that adds remnants from the second era, wayshrines, as an alternate means of traversing  Tamriel. Unlike the shrines left behind the Snow Elves, these shrines can be used by regular mortals at the right cost.\n<br /> \n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][b]This project is a reboot of “Wayshrines of Old”[/b][/color][/center]\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8] \n<br />Requirements: [/color][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim + Dawnguard + Dragonborn\n<br />[*]Optional: [url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE[/url]﻿\n<br />[*]Optional: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863/]SkyUI[/url]﻿\n<br />[/list] \n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Discovery[/color][/b]\n<br />Before you can go on any adventures you first need to discover some shrines. Every location can be found inside of the following categories: Hold Capitals and Cities, Towns and Settlements, Orc Strongholds, and Unique Locations. In order for any locations to show up, you will need to discover the shrines in those locations. Alternatively, you can unlock almost all locations through an optional cheat which can found in the book “Configure Wayshrines” or the Mod Configuration Menu. With the exception of a few shrines, which were intentionally left out to not break the quests that unlock those locations. If you want to reach them, you are going to have to discover them on foot.\n<br /> \n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Configuration[/color][/b]\n<br />Take charge of how the shrines operate in your game by configuring options through the book [b][color=#9fc5e8]“Configure Wayshrines”[/color][/b] or the [b][color=#9fc5e8]Mod Configuration Menu[/color][/b]. Both more or less offer the same options so it doesn’t really matter which one you use. However, do not use both simultaneously as it will only create problems. Simply use one or the other. If you are going to switch from one to the other MAKE SURE that you reset all options to their DEFAULT options.\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/gUuzYkm.png[/img]﻿\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/RQOUOlG.png[/img]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/JPQcdYb.png[/img]\n<br />The book will be added to your inventory whenever you load a save for the first time. Make sure you do not lose your copy of the book as you will not be given another one the next time you load the save. In case you ever lose your copy of the book there is a copy inside of the Riverwood Trader.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/6Szcw2P.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Alternatively open the console and type help JC_ShrineConfigBook. Add the book to your inventory with the following code player.additem xxxIDofBook 1. \n<br /> \n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Civil War Limitations[/color][/b]\n<br />You will not be able to use the following shrines during any of the sieges: Whiterun, Solitude, Windhelm. The shrines are being maintained by the people and they would not leave a backdoor open for enemies to come in through. They will blocked off during the sieges. This has not been fully tested.\n<br />\n<br />Known Issues\n<br />Unfortunately followers will not accompany you when you travel between shrines.
