  "descriptionHtml": "[size=6][center][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5152]Click here to get this mod for Skyrim Special Edition&#33;[/url][/center][/size]\r<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/nc4vHrl.png[/img]\r<br />I wanted a pretty and useful horse, without breaking the lore or resorting to using supernatural horses. None of the available mods appealed to me, however, and Domino is my solution to that problem. He&#39;s been my player character&#39;s faithful steed for a long time now, and I really couldn&#39;t ask for a better companion.\r<br />\r<br />He&#39;s a good deal faster than the default horses, but still has a realistic speed for a draft horse. He also has a lot more stamina than the regular horses, and is set as essential so he won&#39;t be killed by random wildlife when you&#39;re just trying to travel to the next town. Additionally, Domino will aid you in battle, and is quite ferocious towards enemies. He can be found at the Whiterun stables, and is free for the taking. If you later choose a different mount so that the game considers that your &#34;active horse&#34;, he will return to Whiterun.\r<br />\r<br />There are two versions of him - one saddled, and the other with just a bridle, for those who prefer to ride bareback. Both are packaged in BSA format for easy installation and removal. Credits and thanks go to [b]AlienSlof[/b] for her beautiful horse textures and stallion mesh, and [b]Zira[/b] for the custom tack. Big thanks also go to [b]Alek[/b] for providing an edited mesh to remove mane clipping with the Convenient Horses armours.\r<br />\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/dwYNIou.png[/img]\r<br />Domino should work with just about any mod that changes the horse AI. He will work fine with replacer mods, as he uses a custom mesh and textures. Custom skeletons seem to work, too, at least as far as my testing has revealed. His white markings may look overly bright in some lighting conditions, especially if you have FXAA turned on or use ENB or SweetFX. You&#39;ll simply have to test for yourself and play around with your lighting settings if it bothers you. I myself use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36067/]Vividan ENB[/url], and have had no issues with blindingly white markings.\r<br />\r<br />As for compatibility with specific mods, you&#39;ll have to test it for yourself and see.  I can&#39;t guarantee that he&#39;ll work with all of the many horse mods out there, as I only use Convenient Horses in my own game. Reports are of course always welcome so I can keep this section updated. As of right now, I am not planning to make compatibility patches for any of the mount-affecting mods out there. You are however fully allowed to make them yourself, and I will be happy to link to them if you notify me that they exist.\r<br />[b]\r<br />I will NOT be making any versions of Domino to fit the many mods out there that make Skyrim&#39;s horses into the slender sport horse type. I prefer the look of the workhorses Bethesda originally designed for the game, and Domino was made according to those preferences.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/14950]Convenient Horses[/url]\r<br />Fully compatible, including armours and saddle options. This is the mod Domino was made to work best with, and I highly recommend using it alongside this mod to tweak him to your liking if you&#39;re not happy with his default behavior. Please note that CH settings will override Domino&#39;s defaults; for him to work as intended, make sure that your horses are set to essential, and for combat AI, foolhardy. Faction relations are up to your own preferences; neutral if you want him to be the fierce battle steed he was born to be, or friendly if you prefer your mounts to stay out of fights.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15225/]Horse Commands[/url]\r<br />Confirmed as working by Dajunka, and seems to have similar functions to Convenient Horses, so it shouldn&#39;t cause any issues.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70640/]Horses Revamped\r<br />[/url]Fully compatible. Domino uses his own model, and won&#39;t be affected by the HR one. Highly recommended, as it makes the horse animations much better.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64067/]\r<br />Immersive Horses[/url]\r<br />Compatible - there is a replacer .esp in the file section. Major thanks to [b]sevencardz[/b] for making it. It can be used safely even without Immersive Horses, as Domino will default back to his vanilla behaviour.\r<br />\r<br />Steps to add Domino to the IH horse registry, as discovered by [b]DracoMagnusRufus[/b]:\r<br />[quote]1. Add &#34;Domino&#34; to breed list in the .ini [Looks like this -&gt; BreedList=&#34;Black Fell Pony, Grey Fell Pony, Haflinger Horse, Fjord \r<br />Horse, Exmoor Pony, Shadowmere, Frost, Arvak, Blaze, Domino&#34;]\r<br />\r<br />2. Add desired stats for Domino in the .ini [Looks like this -&gt; \r<br />; Domino\r<br />DominoScale=1.00\r<br />DominoSpeedMult=105\r<br />DominoHealth=450\r<br />DominoUnarmedDamage=24\r<br />DominoStamina=500\r<br />DominoLightArmor=50\r<br />DominoHeavyArmor=50\r<br />DominoAggression=0\r<br />DominoConfidence=0]\r<br />[b]\r<br />Suggested stats by sevencardz:\r<br />[/b]; Domino\r<br />DominoScale=1.08\r<br />DominoSpeedMult=105\r<br />DominoHealth=450\r<br />DominoUnarmedDamage=24\r<br />DominoStamina=1000\r<br />DominoLightArmor=50\r<br />DominoHeavyArmor=50\r<br />DominoAggression=1\r<br />DominoConfidence=4[/quote]Save the ini and you should be done. It might require deactivating Immersive Horses and then reactivating for the changes to take effect.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34940/]Swift Steeds[/url]\r<br />Fully compatible, as it only replaces the vanilla horse model.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34799/]About Horses[/url]\r<br />Fully compatible. Domino will look leaner and more long-legged with the skeleton file, but will otherwise be unchanged. See the screenshot section for an example image.\r<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/JkhZki3.png[/img]\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/31039/]Improved Horse Step Sounds[/url]\r<br />For a more immersive sound experience when travelling by horse. One of my must-have audio mods.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/19710/]Zira Skyrim Horse Base[/url]\r<br />More custom horses&#33; Also contains the best-looking saddles I&#39;ve seen in Skyrim so far.\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57456/]Realistic Primitive Horse Breeds[/url]\r<br />An absolutely beautiful replacer for the default horses. Using this with Domino will improve his look drastically, as he uses the same normal map as all other horses.\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65056/]\r<br />Horse Saddles HD[/url]\r<br />Drastically improved textures for the Imperial and Dark Brotherhood saddles. Highly recommended if you use either of them for your own or followers&#39; horses, for example through the Convenient Horses tack settings.[/center]",
