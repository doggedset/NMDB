  "descriptionHtml": "HEY ! This is my first mod created with the Creation Kit. I tested the whole Dungeon all day long but, if there are any bugs I may have missed, then just write a comment.\r\n\r\nFor those people, who are complaining about the short description, here is the long version :D\r\n\r\nZehzts Tomb is a mod which adds a new Dungeon to the world of Skyrim (Category-> Dungeons - New). The entrance is near Riverwood, the same location which is used in the Bethesda Tutorials. When I stared to work on my Dungeon I tried to place it somewhere else, but searching for a good location is really hard when your CK welcomes you with a bunch of Errors after loading a new Exterior-Cell :D\r\nAt this time there is no quest which leads you to the dungeon, but i think i will add this in a future update.\r\n\r\nSpoiler:\r\nThe Dungeon itself consists out of:\r\n- Small rooms, filled with weak Draugrs and a lot of traps \r\n- Boss-room, which is guarded by a Dragonpriest (no unique Mask)\r\n\r\nTipp: Look for the secret Pull-Bar in the Boss-room\r\n\r\n---Installation---\r\n-Download the file\r\n-Just put the .esp File in the Skyrim/Data folder\r\n-Enjoy\r\n\r\n---Deinstallation---\r\nRemove the .esp File",
