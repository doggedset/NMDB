I am not a fan of gold, never have been. I\\'ve met a few like-minded people in my life, so when I got around to retexturing the elven armor to a more ethereal silverish-blue color, I figured I may as well share it.\r\n\r\nI have included the textures for every peice of elven equipment that is currently available, including weapons. The texture resolutions are all double their original size to emphasize fidelity. I will create a lower resolution variant if there is demand for it.\r\n\r\nCurrently, only the Elven Cuirass is 2048x2048 resolution. The rest of the gear was half resolution natively. They are now 1024x1024 resolution.\r\n\r\n[color=deepskyblue][b]INSTALL INFO[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nTo Install these textures: \r\n\r\n1. Unpack the .rar into your Skyrim/ directory.\r\n2. Select yes if a permission box pops up to overwrite any other elven armor    texture files that may be floating around.\r\n\r\nTo Uninstall just delete the files pertinent to this mod.\r\n\r\n[color=deepskyblue][b]OTHER INFO[/b][/color]\r\n\r\nKnown Issues: None so far. I can\\'t fathom one that would arise. It\\'s all fairly straight-forward\r\n\r\n- I\\'ll likely have other texture mods in the future, be sure to keep an eye out.\r\n\r\n- I do not need credit or mention. Do with these textures whatever you see fit.\r\n\r\n[color=deepskyblue][b]MY MODS[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2052][color=deepskyblue]Ethereal Elven Equipment[/color][/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=4884][color=deepskyblue]DRAGONHOOD[/color][/url]\r\n[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5204][color=deepskyblue]Unusual Gem Redux[/color][/url]",
