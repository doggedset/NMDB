  "descriptionHtml": "[center][size=4]This mod gives you 2 new spells,Â Arcane Explosion and Acceleration. [/size][/center]\r<br />Arcane Explosion is simple, an explosion of magic energy emanates from the caster.\r<br />\r<br /> Acceleration is more strategic. It slows down time for 3 seconds. This works like the shout, Slow Time, only on a smaller scale (less time) and no cooldown (instant cast as well). Using this you could avoid a fireball or a sword swing, you could use it to get behind your enemy, or use it for sneaking about. Since you can move relatively quickly compared to the rest of the world, all they see is a quick blur, hence, Acceleration.\r<br />\r<br />Both spells can be found in the kitchen of Dragonsreach, the Yarl&#39;s palace in Whiterun.\r<br />\r<br />V1.1 changelog\r<br />Removed the requirement that you must have Dawnguard and Dragonborn DLC\r<br />Changed Acceleration to a lesser power as to allow shield users, dual wielders, master spell users, etc. to get the most out of the mod as well.\r<br />Removed spell version of Acceleration as it is rendered unnecessary.\r<br />\r<br />If you like the mod, endorse it.\r<br />\r<br />If you find a bug, please report it.\r<br />\r<br />Requirements:\r<br />Up-to-date Skyrim\r<br />Dawnguard\r<br />Dragonborn\r<br />\r<br />As of now the dragonborn DLC is required as a parent file. However I may do some tweaking to remove it if requested. I always use all content in my mod creation so it may or may not have dragonborn or dawnguard content. The next version will most likely require neither DLC. I felt like putting up what i had now anyway though.\r<br />\r<br />If this mod is like another that is already released I apologize. However, I could not find one (or didn&#39;t look hard enough) therefore I made my own for personal use. I figured I might aswell put it up for others.",
