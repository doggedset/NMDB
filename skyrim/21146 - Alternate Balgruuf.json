  "summary": "A new alternate appearance for Balgruuf the Great, Jarl of Whiterun.",
  "descriptionHtml": "I personally think vanilla Balgruuf the Greater looks a bit goofy and not very intimidating for a man with the title of Jarl of Whiterun and someone who holds considerable power over the common folk of his Jarldom. Plus he also looks quite skinny, not exactly a man blessed by Talos with the physique of a TES Nord!\r\n\r\nTo that end, I have edited Balgruuf\\\\\\'s appearance into what I consider to be a much more normal, more manly and overall better appearance of the Jarl of Whiterun. \r\n\r\nThe change isn\\\\\\'t total, much of Balgruuf remains the same, his eyes and facial features/structure have been left unchanged, his other features have, I feel, been improved, although, as with my other mods, I\\\\\\'m sure many will disagree, and those who do are free to not download it. That said, I hope those who do download this small mod are pleased with the new appearance of Balgruuf.",
