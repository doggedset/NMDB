  "descriptionHtml": "=================\r\nDetails:\r\n=================\r\n\r\nWhenever you initiate a conversation with Sheogorath, potatoes will fly everywhere! Inspired by this quote from Arthmoor: \\\"This is only going to be an issue if you have a room filled with hundreds of potatoes. Since no vanilla interior does, and no sane modder around will do such a thing either, it isn\\'t going to be an issue for the 5 or 6 you DO find in these places.\\\"\r\n\r\nLet it be known! I AM NO SANE MODDER.\r\n\r\nNote: this mod uses the placeatme command. I\\'m not sure if the Papyrus version causes the problems the command has in past games, but it might be a good idea to keep your interaction with Sheogorath to a minimum.\r\n\r\nThis mod is JUST FOR FUN.",
