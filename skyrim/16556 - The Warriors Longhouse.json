  "descriptionHtml": "About me:\r\n\r\nI have just recently started modding so any feedback will be really appreciated.\r\n\r\nAbout the Warrior’s Longhouse:\r\n\r\nThe Warrior’s Longhouse is a great free player home that is near the western watchtower near whiterun. It has everything that you may need. From a alchemy bench to a bed. It is designed after a longhouse in an orc stronghold therefore it is perfect for warriors, but it is also great for a place to stay.\r\n\r\nWhat’s new:\r\n\r\nI have changed the location to near the western watch tower (look on map). I will upload pictures as soon as possible. I have added stables with 2 horses in and also I have made a nice shack for the crafting equipment to go in. Since the shack is outside all the time it has some grass growing inside it for some realism.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggestions: \r\n\r\nPlease leave any suggestions for ways I can improve the mod and I will try and get it finished as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nSteam: \r\n\r\nAlso on the workshop http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=68071281 \r\n\r\n",
