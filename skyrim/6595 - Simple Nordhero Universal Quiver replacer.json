  "descriptionHtml": "Simple Nordhero Universal Quiver replacer\r\n\r\nDescription;\r\n\r\nwanted one quiver for all arrows types that would \\\"fit\\\" asthetically with different armors, Wasn\\'t pleased with the different vanilla quivers so I found a mod that does smething similar but has i recipes to it and something about private arrows. didn\\'t want that stuff but only to replace the \r\nquiver the player carries (we assume player just restocks the quiver with found arrows..no need for recipes in my opinion). So because i cannot mod very well, i just edited the file pathway from that mod and didn\\'t use the given esp thus making this mod a simple universal quiver retexture/replacer.\r\n\r\nthis mod replaces the following quivers for the nordhero quiver (in my opinion it looks realistic, neat, and compact);\r\n\r\ndaedric quiver\r\ndraugr quiver\r\ndwarven quiver\r\nebony quiver\r\nelven quiver\r\nglass quiver\r\niron quiver\r\nnordhero quiver\r\norcish quiver\r\nsteel quiver\r\n\r\nInstallation (Manual): \r\n- Download the main file \r\n- Open the main archive and move the textures, meshes, to Skyrim data directory. (These are all the files required)(just follow the file path)\r\n  c;\\\\program files\\\\the elder scrolls v skyrim\\\\data\r\n\r\nUninstallation (Manual):\r\n- Remove the textures, meshes\r\n\r\nI did not make any of these meshes or retextures; what i did was edit their file path locations so that they only replace the files i want. subsequently this will also change any npc that equips arrow/quivers to the nordhero which i don\\'t mind\r\n\r\nAll credit for the original mod goes to; \r\n\r\nthe original mod \\\"Private Selective Quivers\\\" by Ryeong and uploaded by hl84 on nexus\r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6546\r\n\r\nHave not had any bugs/issues but if there are comment, i am new to modding so dont expect miracle fixes.\r\n\r\nComment, endorse its all good, All THANKS GOES TO hl84/Ryeong     \r\n\r\nYou may use this mod so long as you mention it origins and creators. \r\n\r\nMy other lore friendly mods;\r\n\r\nThieves Guild Regular Armor Retextures \r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6407\r\n\r\nSimpler Jewel Craft pack and ideal changes \r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6188\r\n\r\nSimpler Dragonbone Weapons Pack \r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6027\r\n\r\nRecommendations;\r\n\r\nBetter steel arrows and quiver by Reisz (looks better) \r\nhttp://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5821",
