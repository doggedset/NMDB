  "descriptionHtml": "[IMG]http://i1338.photobucket.com/albums/o686/KingUggi/hdf_zps40c6a0bf.jpg~original[/IMG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nSo, this is my third follower mod. This one is based on my Skyrim character Danya. I used to play her as a warrior with sword or axe and a shield. She has also a healing spell, so she can recover herself from some hits. She is part of the Vigilants of Stendarr that means you better don\\'t attack one as longs as she is near you and not your current follower. You can also take advantage of this though, because it means if someone is attacking Danya the Vigilants will help. You can find Danya at High Hrothgar, she should be around right at the entrance hall. This follower is completely STANDALONE, so you don\\'t require any mod to use it; there are own meshes and textures. I would like to advance this mod further, but as it failed with Lanaya (\\\"Companion Lanaya\\\") I won\\'t focus/ insist on expanding it. Of course there will be minor updates and improvements. But anyway, if someone likes to work with me to enhance this follower, feel free to contact me via PM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDanya\\'s characteristics\r\n\r\nBody: UNP Body (I might add other bodies in the future if requested)\r\nRequirements: None. DANYA IS COMPLETELY STANDALONE!\r\nLocation: High Hrothgar\r\nClass: Vigilant (melee, one-handed, healing spell, ward speall)\r\nAllied Factions: Vigilants of Stendarr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n\r\nManual: Just drag and drop the files included in the archive to “C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\SteamApps\\\\common\\\\Skyrim\\\\Data”\r\nNMM: Just add the mod and activate it^^\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n\r\nThis mod is compatible with every DLC. Mod conflicts have not been reported so far. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBugs\r\n\r\nNone known for now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPermissions\r\n\r\nPlease don\\'t upload this mod somewhere else or upload an edited version without asking me for my permission. I put already a lot of work into this mod and I won\\'t tolerate if someone is trying to exploit it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n\r\nBig thanks to \r\nhellosanta (for lending me her textures and further support) \r\nHalendia (for lending me his [url=http://www.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30823/]eye texture[/url] )\r\nAll my testers (anka01, Tru3lMagic, EcIiptic, igora, nexustucker, Robsongolightly)\r\nThe Nexus Team for giving people like me the opportunity to share their work\r\nThe downloaders for downloading :p\r\n",
